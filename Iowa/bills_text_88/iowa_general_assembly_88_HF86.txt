furnish
reasonable

.
If

7


shall

harmless
for
the
cost
of

the
employee
that

9


authorizing
all
or
any
part
of
the
care
and
the
reason
for
10


the
change
in
authorization.
An
employer
is
not
liable
for
11


the
cost
of
care
that
the
employer
arranges
in
response
to
a
12


sudden
emergency
if
the
employee’s
condition,
for
which
care
13


was
arranged,
is
not
related
to
the
employment.
The
treatment
14

offered
promptly
and
be
reasonably
suited
to
treat
the
15


injury
without
undue
inconvenience
to
the

(2)


If

employee
has

to
be
dissatisfied
with
the
17


care
offered,
the
employee
should
communicate
the
basis
of
18


such
dissatisfaction
to
the
employer,
in
writing
if
requested,
19


following
which
the
employer
and
the
employee
may
agree
to
20


alternate
care
reasonably
suited
to
treat
the
injury.
If
the
21


employer
and
employee
cannot
agree
on
such
alternate
care,
the
22


commissioner
may,
upon
application
and
reasonable
proofs


proof
23


of
the
necessity
therefor,
allow
and
order
other
care.
In
an
24


emergency,
the
employee
may
choose
the
employee’s
care
at
the
25

expense,
provided
the

If

employee
obtains
14


such
an
evaluation
and
the
employer
believes
this
evaluation
15


of
permanent
disability
to
be
too
high,
the
employer
may
16


arrange
for
a
medical
examination
of
the
injured
employee
by
a
17


physician
of
the
employer’s
choice
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
18


a

EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


This
bill
relates
to
the
choice
of
a
physician
to
treat
an
5


injured
employee
under
the
state’s
workers’
compensation
laws.
6


The
bill
allows
the
employer
to
choose
care
unless
the
employee
7


has
predesignated
a
physician
as
provided
in
the
bill.
8


The
bill
gives
an
employee
the
right
to
predesignate
a
9


physician
who
is
a
primary
care
provider,
who
has
previously
10


provided
treatment
to
the
employee
and
has
retained
the
11


employee’s
medical
records,
to
provide
treatment
for
a
12


work-related
injury.
The
employer
is
required
to
provide
13


written
notice
to
employees
of
this
right
upon
hire,
and
14


periodically
during
employment,
and
upon
receiving
notice
of
15


an
injury
from
an
employee
who
has
not
yet
predesignated
a
16


physician
of
their
right
to
do
so,
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
17


the
workers’
compensation
commissioner.
An
employer
or
an
18


employer’s
insurer
shall
not
coerce
or
otherwise
attempt
to
19


influence
an
injured
employee’s
choice
of
a
physician.
20


If
the
employer
fails
to
provide
such
notification,
an
21


injured
employee
has
the
right
to
choose
any
physician
to
22


provide
treatment
for
the
work-related
injury
and
that
23


treatment
shall
be
considered
authorized
care.
24


If
the
employer
or
employee
is
dissatisfied
with
the
care
25


chosen
by
the
other
party,
the
dissatisfied
party
is
required
26


to
communicate
the
basis
of
dissatisfaction
to
the
other


27


party
in
writing
and
the
parties
may
agree
to
alternate
care
28


reasonably
suited
to
treat
the
injury.
If
the
parties
cannot
29


agree
to
such
alternate
care,
the
dissatisfied
party
may
make
30


an
application
for
alternate
care
to
the
commissioner.
31


An
application
for
alternate
care
is
an
original
proceeding
32


and
is
treated
as
a
contested
case.
A
party
may
request
that
33


the
hearing
be
held
in
person,
by
telephone,
or
by
audio-video
34


conference.

permanent

obtained
by
the
employee
is
