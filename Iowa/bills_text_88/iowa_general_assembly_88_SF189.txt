EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
modifies
the
periods
of
time
to
bring
civil
actions
4


relating
to
young
persons
and
persons
with
mental
illness.
5


Under
current
Code
section
614.1(12),
a
civil
action
for
6


damages
for
injury
suffered
as
result
of
sexual
abuse,
as
7


defined
in
Code
section
709.1,
or
sexual
exploitation,
by
a
8


counselor,
therapist,
or
school
employee,
each
as
defined
in
9


Code
section
709.15,
can
only
be
brought
within
five
years
10


after
the

the
victim
was
either
last
treated
by
11


the
counselor
or
therapist
or
last
enrolled
in
or
attended
12


the
school.
The
bill
amends
the
current
law
by
making
a
13


distinction
between
victims
that
are
minors
at
the
time
of
14


abuse
and
victims
that
are
18
years
of
age
or
older
at
the
time
15


of
abuse.
The
bill
does
not
change
the
statute
of
limitations
16


for
victims
that
are
18
years
of
age
or
older
at
the
time
of
17


abuse.
For
victims
that
are
minors
at
the
time
of
abuse,
the
18


bill
provides
that
victims
may
bring
an
action
at
any
time,
but
19


that
a
claim
that
arises
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
20


bill
must
be
brought
within
five
years
of
the
effective
date
21


of
the
bill.
22


Under
current
Code
section
614.8,
the
applicable
limitations
23


period
in
which
to
bring
certain
civil
actions
is
extended
for
24


persons
with
mental
illness
and
minors.
Under
current
Code
25


section
670.2,
a
municipality
is
subject
to
liability
for
the
26


municipality’s
torts
and
those
of
the
municipality’s
officers
27


and
employees,
acting
within
the
scope
of
such
officers’
28


and
employees’
employment
or
duties.
Under
current
Code
29


section
670.5,
an
action
for
damages
for
an
injury
against
a
30


municipality
cannot
be
brought
after
two
years
of
the
alleged
31


injury,
except
as
provided
in
Code
section
614.8.
32


The
bill
amends
Code
section
614.8
to
specify
that
the
33


extension
of
the
limitations
period
for
persons
with
mental
34


illness
and
for
minors
applies
to
claims
brought
