EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


This
bill
relates
to
the
cause
of
action
of
negligent
hiring.
5


The
bill
does
not
expand
or
create
any
other
causes
of
action.
6


Under
current
law,
the
tort
of
negligent
hiring
allow
a
7


person
injured
by
an
employee
to
sue
the
employee’s
employer
8


even
though
the
act
was
committed
outside
the
scope
of
the
9


employment
due
to
some
fault
resting
with
the
employer
for
10


hiring
the
employee.
11


The
bill
provides
that
the
cause
of
action
of
negligent
12


hiring
shall
not
be
brought
against
a
private
employer,
general
13


contractor,
or
premises
owner
based
solely
on
evidence
that
the
14


employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
has
been
convicted
15


of
a
public
offense.
However,
the
bill
does
not
preclude
16


causes
of
action
for
negligent
hiring
of
an
employee,
agent,
17


or
independent
contractor,
if
two
criteria
are
met.
First,
18


the
private
employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
owner
19


knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
conviction;
and
second,
the
20


employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
was
convicted
of
a
21


public
offense
enumerated
in
the
bill
or
a
public
offense
that
22


was
committed
while
performing
duties
substantially
similar
to
23


those
reasonably
expected
to
be
performed
in
the
employment,
24


or
under
the
relationship
or
contract,
or
under
conditions
25


substantially
similar
to
those
reasonably
expected
to
be
26


encountered
in
the
employment
or
the
relationship
or
contract,
27


taking
into
consideration
enumerated
factors
set
forth
in
the
28


bill.
29


The
bill
provides
that
the
protections
provided
to
a
private
30


employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
owner
do
not
apply
31


in
a
suit
concerning
the
misuse
of
funds
or
property
of
a
32


person
other
than
the
employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
33


owner,
by
an
employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
if,
on
34


the

the

or
independent
contractor
was
