the
explanation’s
substance
by

members
of
the
general
assembly.

BACKGROUND.
This
bill
amends
provisions
in
Code
chapter

(Code

459.101)
regulating
confinement
feeding
operations
(operations)
4


and
associated
confinement
buildings,
manure
storage
5


structures,
and
egg
washwater
storage
structures
(structures)
6


by
the
department
of
natural
resources
(DNR).
The
Code
chapter
7


includes
subchapter
II
regulating
air
quality
and
subchapter
8


III
regulating
water
quality.
The
bill
increases
certain
9


separation
distance
requirements.
10


AIR
QUALITY.
Code
section
459.202
imposes
a
separation
11


distance
between
a
structure
and
a
number
of
benefited
12


locations
including
a
residence.
The
amount
of
the
separation
13


distance
required
depends
upon:
(1)
when
the
confinement
14


feeding
operation
structure
was
constructed
or
expanded,
15


and
(2)
the
size
of
the
confinement
feeding
operation.
The
16


bill
increases
by
500
feet
the
separation
distances
between
17


a
structure
constructed
or
expanded
on
or
after
the
bill’s
18


effective
date
and
a
residence.
Different
separation
distance
19


requirements
apply
depending
on
whether
the
residence
is
20


located
within
or
outside
the
limits
of
a
city.
A
number
21


of
exceptions
apply,
including
provisions
in
Code
section
22


459.203
which
allows
an
operation
constructed
or
expanded
23


prior
to
the
date
that
a
distance
requirement
became
effective
24


to
expand
under
certain
circumstances;
Code
section
459.205
25


which
provides
for
small
animal
feeding
operations,
when
a
26


neighboring
titleholder
executes
a
written
waiver,
or
when
a
27


benefited
location
encroaches
within
the
separation
distance;
28


and
Code
section
459.206
which
provides
an
exception
for
29


a
qualified
operation
structure
that
treats
manure
using
30


aeration.
31


Code
section
459.204
imposes
a
separation
distance
between
32


the
land
where
liquid
manure
is
applied
and
a
benefited
33


location.
The
bill
increases
by
250
feet
the
separation
34


distance
between
the
land
and
a
residence,
subject
to
the

WATER
QUALITY.
Code
section
459.310
imposes
a
separation
2


distance
between
a
structure
and
a
major
water
source
or
minor
3


water
source.
Code
section
459.102
defines
a
major
water
4


source
to
include
a
lake,
reservoir,
river,
or
stream
capable
5


of
supporting
a
floating
vessel
carrying
one
or
more
persons
6


during
a
total
of
a
six-month
period
in
one

The
bill
increases
by

the
separation
distance
between

and
both
types
of
water
sources.

Code
12


section

of
civil
penalties,
20


or

which
provides
for
