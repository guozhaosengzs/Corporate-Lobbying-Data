EXPLANATION
14


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
15


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
16


This
bill
requires
a
farm
unit
agreement
be
executed
when
any
17


lease
is
entered
into
by
a
local
government
and
a
person
who
18


may
use
the
leased
land
for
farming
purposes.
The
agreement
19


requires
the
lessee
to
comply
with
applicable
soil
and
water
20


conservation
practices,
farming
practices,
water
quality
21


practices,
and
soil
health
practices
during
the
period
of
the
22


lease.
The
agreement
must
be
developed
in
cooperation
with
23


the
commissioners
of
the
soil
and
water
conservation
district
24


where
the
land
is
located
who
are
parties
to
the
agreement.
25


The
commissioners
may
conduct
inspections
to
ensure
compliance
26


with
the
agreement
and
take
administrative
or
judicial
action
27


to
enforce
its
provisions.
The
bill
does
not
apply
to
a
lease
28


that
is
for
less
than
60
days
unless
the
local
government
and
29


the
same
person
have
entered
into
multiple
subsequent
leases
30


involving
the
same
land.
31


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
32


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
33


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
34


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
