EXPLANATION
18


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
19


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
20


This
bill
relates
to
licensing
of
a
telepharmacy
site.
21


The
bill
eliminates
the
prohibition
in
current
law
against
22


the
issuance
of
a
special
or
limited-use
pharmacy
license
to
23


a
telepharmacy
site
if
a
licensed
pharmacy
that
dispenses
24


prescription
drugs
to
outpatients
is
located
within
10
25


miles
of
the
proposed
telepharmacy
site,
unless
the
proposed
26


telepharmacy
site
is
located
on
property
owned,
operated,
27


or
leased
by
the
state
or
unless
the
proposed
telepharmacy
28


site
is
located
within
a
hospital
campus
and
is
limited
to
29


inpatient
dispensing.
Current
law
also
provides
that
the
30


mileage
requirement
does
not
apply
to
a
telepharmacy
site
that
31


was
approved
and
operating
as
a
telepharmacy
prior
to
July
1,
32


2016.
The
bill
also
eliminates
a
corresponding
provision
that
33


would
allow
an
applicant
that
did
not
meet
or
was
not
otherwise
34


exempt
from
the
mileage
requirement
to
apply
for
a
waiver
