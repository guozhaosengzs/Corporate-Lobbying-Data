Additionally,
the
program
prohibits
the
distribution
of
2


family
planning
services
program
funds
to
an
entity
that
3


performs
abortions
or
that
maintains
or
operates
a
facility
4


where
abortions
are
performed.
However,
this
prohibition
5


is
not
to
be
interpreted
to
include
a
nonpublic
entity
that
6


is
a
distinct
location
of
a
nonprofit
health
care
delivery
7


system
if
the
distinct
location
provides
family
planning
8


services
but
does
not
perform
abortions
or
maintain
or
operate
9


as
a
facility
where
abortions
are
performed
and
if,
as
a
10


condition
of
such
eligibility,
each
distinct
location
of
the
11


nonprofit
health
care
delivery
system
enrolls
in
the
state
12


family
planning
services
program
as
a
separate
provider,
13


is
assigned
a
distinct
provider
identification
number,
and
14


completes
an
attestation
that
abortions
are
not
performed
15


at
the
distinct
location.
Under
current
law,
a
“nonprofit
16


health
care
delivery
system”
is
defined
as
an
Iowa
nonprofit
17


corporation
that
controls,
directly
or
indirectly,
a
regional
18


health
care
network
consisting
of
hospital
facilities
and
19


various
ambulatory
and
clinic
locations
that
provide
a
range
20


of
primary,
secondary,
and
tertiary
inpatient,
outpatient,
and
21


physician
services.
The
bill
expands
this
definition
to
also
22


include
as
a
“nonprofit
health
care
delivery
system”
a
global
23


nonprofit
corporation
that
operates,
through
affiliates,
as
24


the
largest
single
provider
of
reproductive
health
services
in
25


the
United
States
and
provides
a
range
of
services
including
26


general
health
care,
women’s
health
care
services,
men’s
health
27


care
services,
and
patient
education.
