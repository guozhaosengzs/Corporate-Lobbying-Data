CURRENT
IOWA
LAW.
Under
current
law,
motor
vehicles
17


designed
to
carry
not
more
than
nine
persons
as
passengers,
18


either
school
owned
or
privately
owned,
are
excluded
from
the
19


definition
of
“school
bus”
under
Code
section
321.1,
thereby
20


excluding
such
vehicles
from
the
duties
and
requirements
21


relating
to
school
buses
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
321
22


(motor
vehicles
and
law
of
the
road).
To
qualify
under
the
23


exclusion,
a
vehicle
must
be
used
to
transport
pupils
to
24


activity
events
in
which
the
pupils
are
participants
or
used
25


to
transport
pupils
to
their
homes
in
case
of
illness
or
other
26


emergency
situations,
and
must
be
operated
by
an
employee
of
27


the
school
district
who
is
specifically
approved
by
the
local
28


superintendent
of
schools
for
the
assignment.
29


Administrative
rules
of
the
department
of
education
regulate
30


type
III
vehicles
used
as
school
buses.
Under
281
IAC
44.2(5),
31


type
III
vehicles
are
not
regular
school
buses
but
are
used
32


to
transport
students
in
a
school-related
context
and
may
33


be
marked
as
a
school
bus.
A
type
III
vehicle
is
a
van
or
34


passenger
car,
including
a
minivan,
sport
utility
vehicle,
or

station
wagon.
The
difference
between
a
family
automobile
and
1


an
equivalent
type
III
vehicle
is
not
the
vehicle
itself,
but
2


rather
its
use,
as
type
III
vehicles
are
used
by
schools
for
3


purposes
of
student
transportation.
To
qualify
as
a
type
III
4


vehicle,
the
vehicle
must
carry
a
maximum
of
nine
or
fewer
5


people,
including
the
driver,
and
weigh
10,000
pounds
or
less.
6


Under
281
IAC
44.5(1),
vehicles
classified
as
pickups
are
not
7


allowed
to
be
used
for
student
transportation.
All
type
III
8


vehicles
are
prohibited
from
carrying
more
passengers
than
9


there
are
seat
belts
as
installed
by
the
manufacturer
(281
10


IAC
44.5(1)(d)).
In
addition,
trailer
hitches
are
allowed
on
11


type
III
vehicles
in
accordance
with
the
manufacturer’s
rated
12


towing
capacity,
but
students
are
not
allowed
to
be
transported
13


in
the
vehicle
when
the
vehicle
is
being
used
to
tow
(281
IAC
14


44.5(2)(j)).
15


Any
person
who
operates
or
allows
the
operation
of
any
16


vehicle
as
a
school
bus
which
does
not
comply
with
the
17


requirements
provided
by
law
or
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
18


the
department
of
education,
or
for
which
there
is
not
a
valid
19


temporary
certificate
for
operation,
is
guilty
of
a
simple
20


misdemeanor
(Code
section
285.14).
The
department
of
education
21


is
required
to
review
all
transportation
arrangements
when
22


deemed
necessary,
to
disapprove
any
arrangements
that
are
not
23


in
conformity
with
the
law
and
established
standards,
and
to
24


require
the
arrangements
to
be
altered
or
changed
so
that
they
25


do
conform
with
the
law
and
established
standards
(Code
section
26


285.8).
27


CURRENT
FEDERAL
LAW.
49
U.S.C.
§30112(a)(1)
prohibits
the
28


manufacture,
sale,
or
import
of
a
motor
vehicle
that
does
not
29


comply
with
applicable
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
if
the
30


vehicle
was
manufactured
on
or
after
the
date
an
applicable
31


safety
standard
took
effect.
The
provision
does
not
apply
32


after
the
first
purchase
of
the
motor
vehicle
in
good
faith
33


other
than

Therefore,

provision
prohibits
the
34

of
a
new

vehicle
for
use
as
a
school
bus
if

Under

any
motor
vehicle
designed
