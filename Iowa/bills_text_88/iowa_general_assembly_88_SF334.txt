If
the
review
results
in
the
department
finding
1


a
potential
discrepancy
or
change
in
the
individual’s
2


circumstances
that
may
affect
eligibility,
the
department
shall
3


promptly
notify
the
individual.

(1)
The
department
shall
provide
written
notice
to
the
5


enrollee,
which
shall
describe
in
sufficient
detail
the
6


circumstances
of
the
potential
discrepancy
or
change,
the
7


manner
in
which
the
enrollee
may
respond,
and
the
consequences
8


of
failing
to
take
action.
However,
a
self-declaration
of
an
9


enrollee
alone
shall
not
be
accepted
as
verification
to
refute
10


the
information.
11


(2)
The
enrollee
shall
have
thirty
business
days
to
respond
12


to
the
department

provide
information
to
13


refute
and

the
potential
discrepancy
or
change.
After

receiving
the

written
response,

may
15


request
additional
documentation
if
the
department
determines
16


that
the
documentation
is
inadequate
or
that
a
risk
of
fraud
or
17


misrepresentation
exists.
A
self-declaration
of
an
enrollee
18


refuting
the
information
shall
not,
alone,
constitute
a
19


refutation
of
the
potential
discrepancy
or
change.
20


(3)
If
the
enrollee
does
not
respond
to
the
written
21


notice
in
a
timely
manner,
the
department
shall
provide
22


notice
to
terminate
the
individual’s
enrollment,
based
upon
23


the
individual’s
failure
to
cooperate,
and
shall
terminate
24


the
individual’s
enrollment
in
any
applicable
public
25


assistance
program.
The
individual’s
eligibility
shall
not
be
26


reestablished
until
the
discrepancy
or
change
is
resolved.
27


(4)
If
the
enrollee
responds
to
the
written
notice
in
a
28


timely
manner
and
disagrees
with
the
findings,
the
department
29


shall
reevaluate
the
enrollee’s
situation.
If
the
department
30


determines
through
the
reevaluation
that
the
information
upon
31


which
the
discrepancy
or
change
was
based
is
in
error,
the
32


department
shall
take
immediate
action
to
correct
the
error
and
33


no
further
action
on
the
enrollee’s
eligibility
status
shall
be
34


taken.

that

of
the
department’s

reevaluation
and
the
actions
to
be
taken
shall
be
provided
to

the

If
the

responds
to
the
written
notice
in
a

timely
manner
and
agrees
with
the
findings,
the
department
7


shall
determine
the
effect
on

circumstances
and

take
appropriate
action.
