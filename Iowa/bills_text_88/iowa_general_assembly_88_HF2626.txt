a
local
farm
produce
fund
to

the

12


FERTILIZERS
AND
SOIL
CONDITIONERS.
The
bill
authorizes
DALS
13


to
adopt
rules
regulating
the
design,
construction,
location,
14


installation,

operation
of

associated
with
15


the
use
of
fertilizers
and
soil
conditioners
(Code
sections
16


200.3
and
200.14).
Current
law
allows
DALS
to
adopt
such
17


rules
regulating
anhydrous
ammonia
equipment.
The
bill
also
18


eliminates
a
requirement
that
such
rules
be
in
conformity
with
19


the
published
standards
of
the
agricultural
ammonia
institute.
20


A
person
violating
such

is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
21


(Code
section
200.18).
22


WEIGHTS
AND
MEASURES
(GENERAL).
The
bill
amends
a
number
23


of
provisions
regulating
weights
and
measures,
including
the
24


inspection
of
associated
devices.
The
bill
reduces
the
fee
25


for
the
inspection
of
motor
fuel
pumps
from
$9
to
$4.50
(the
26


same
amount
due
under
current
law
if
the
inspection
fee
is
paid
27


early)
(Code
section
214.3).
The
bill
no
longer
requires
that
28


DALS
deliver
a
late
payment
notice
to
an
owner
or
operator
of
29


a
device
by
certified
mail
(Code
section
214.4).
The
bill
30


eliminates
a
requirement
that
a
weighmaster
(a
person
who
keeps
31


and
uses
a
device
as
part
of
a
business)
must
take
an
oath
(Code
32


sections

and

AND
MEASURES
(MOTOR

214A.2A).
The
bill
repeals
a
provision
providing
for
the
1


advertising
of
motor
fuel
(Code
section
214A.3).
The
bill
also
2


repeals
a
provision
prohibiting
a
person
from
placing
gasoline
3


into
a
receptacle,
unless
the
receptacle
states
a
warning
(Code
4


section
214A.15).
5


WEIGHTS
AND
MEASURES
(INSPECTIONS).
The
bill
provides
that
6


DALS
may
but
is
no
longer
required
to
charge
a
license
fee
for
7


a
device
that
has
been
taken
out
of
service
due
to
a
repair
8


and
reinspected
(Code
section
215.4).
The
bill
allows
DALS
9


to
make
an
exception
in
a
case
where
a
commercial
transaction
10


involves
a
small
package,
and
the
person
would
otherwise
be
11


guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
because
the
person
stated
12


a
false
weight
or
measure
(Code
section
215.7).
The
bill
13


provides
for
the
regulation
of
a
servicer
(a
person
employed
14


to
install,
service,
or
repair
a
device),
by
eliminating
15


an
examination
requirement
and
allowing
DALS
to
require
16


qualification
standards
which
may
include
an
examination
17


(Code
sections
215.1
and
215.23).
The
bill
provides
for
a
18


two-year
rather
than
annual
servicer
license
and
allows
DALS
to
19


establish
the
license
fee.
The
annual
license
fee
is
currently
20


$5.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
allows
DALS
to
charge
21


a
complaining
party
an
inspection
fee,
if
the
complaint
was
22


unfounded
(Code
section
215.3).
The
bill
repeals
a
provision
23


that
authorizes
DALS
to
establish
reasonable
variances
in
the
24


weighing
and
measuring
of
small
packages
(Code
section
215.8).
25


That
qualification
is
incorporated
in
the
amendments
to
the
26


provision
regulating
small
package
transactions
(Code
section
27


215.7).
28


CRIMINAL
PENALTIES.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by

of

$65
30


but
not
more
than

or
