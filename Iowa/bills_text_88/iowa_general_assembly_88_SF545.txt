and
also
represent

of
12


the
child
as

ad

The

must
be

e.
Other
material
changes
in
circumstances,
if

In
determining
whether
the

has
or
has
not

or
whether
the
23


child
is
imminently
likely

plan,
the
department,
or
the

or

b.
If
the

former
parent
due
3


to
allegations
of
abuse
or
neglect
prior
to
the
expiration
4


of
the

six-month
period,
the

At

the
six-month
period,
the
court
shall
hold
9


a
hearing
and
order
one
of

10


a.
If

former
parent
has
been
11


successful,
the
court
shall
enter
a
final
order
of
12


reinstatement
of

which
shall
restore
all
13


rights,

duties,
and
obligations
14


of
the
parent
as

22


child’s
case
permanency
plan
shall
remain

23


11.
A
proceeding
to
reinstate
parental
rights
is
a
separate
24


action
from
the
termination
of
parental
rights
proceeding
25


and
does
not
vacate
or
otherwise
affect
the
validity
of
the
26


original
termination
of
parental
rights
order.
An
order
27


granted
under
this
section
reinstates
the
former
parent’s
28


rights
to
the
child.
The
reinstatement
is
a
recognition
that
29


the
situation
of
the
parent
and
child
has
changed
since
the
30


time
of
the
termination
of
parental
rights
and
reunification
31


is
now
appropriate.
32


12.
A
parent
whose
rights
are
reinstated
under
this
33


section
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
child
support
owed
to
the

department
or
costs

This
section
shall
apply
to
any
eligible
child
who
is

under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court
at
the
time
of
the

hearing
regardless
of
the
date
parental
rights
were
terminated.

14.
The
state,
the
department,
or
an
agency
or
other
person

or

is
not
liable
for

or
omission
in
the
provision

under
this
section
unless
the
act

constitutes
gross

negligence.
This
section
does
not
create
any
duty
and
shall
10


not
be
construed
to
create
a
duty
where
none
exists.
This
11


section
does
not
create
a
cause
of
action
against
the
state,
12


the
department,
an
agency,
another
person,
or
the
employees
of
13


such
entities
concerning

EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
provides
for
the

of

18


following
the

The

that
20


a

the
child
has
not
been
adopted
32


and
the
child
has
not
achieved
the
goals
of
the
child’s
case
33

However,
1


upon

own
motion,
the
court
may
hear
a

If
a
child
meets
the
criteria
of
an
eligible
child,
the
5


child’s
GAL,
DHS,
or
an
agency
or
person
to
whom
guardianship
6


and
custody
of
the
child
has
been
transferred,
is
required
to
7


notify
the
child
of
the
child’s
right
to
petition
the
court
for
8


the

Additionally,
if
the
former
parent
whose
9


rights
have
been
previously
terminated
contacts
the
child’s
10


GAL,
DHS,
or
the
agency
or

the
criteria
of
an
eligible
child,
the
GAL,
DHS,
or
the
agency
12


or
other
person
is
required
to
notify
the
eligible
child
of
the
13


child’s
right
to
petition
the

for
the

14


The
bill
provides
for
the
appointment
of
a
GAL
and
attorney
15


for
the
child
if
the
child
does
not
already
have
a
GAL

attorney,
at
no

17


The

the
child,
unless
good
cause
18


is
shown
as
to
why
the
child
is
unable

so.
The
former
19


parent
for
whom
reinstatement
of
parental
rights
is
sought
must
20


consent
in
writing
to
the
petition.
21


After
a
threshold
hearing
to
consider
the
former
parent’s
22


apparent
fitness
and
interest
in
reinstatement
of
parental
23


rights,
if
the
court
finds
by
a

24


that
the
best
interest
of
the

may
be
served
by
the

reinstatement
of
parental
rights,
the
court
shall
order
that
26


a

The
bill

provides

28


on
the

of
the
petition.
Following
the
hearing
on
the
29


merits
of
the
petition,
the
court
shall
conditionally
grant
the
30


petition
if
the
court
finds
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
31


that
the
child
has
not
been
adopted,
has
not
achieved
the
goals
32


of
the
child’s
case
permanency
plan,
and
is
not
imminently
33


likely
to
achieve
such
goals,
and
that
the
reinstatement
34


of
parental
rights
is
in
the
child’s
best
interest.

rights
to
the
child.
The
reinstatement

a
recognition
that
1


the
situation
of
the
parent

the
2


time
of
the
termination
of
parental
rights

any
child
support
owed

the
department
or
costs
of
5


other
services
provided
to
a
child
during

the
act
or
omission
constitutes
gross
negligence.
The
bill

does
not
create
any
duty
and
shall
not
be
construed
to
create
a
16


duty
where
none
exists,

not
create
a
cause
of
action
17


against
the
