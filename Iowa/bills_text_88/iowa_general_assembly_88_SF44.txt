of
a
law
enforcement
agency
where
5


individuals
are
questioned
about
alleged
crimes
or
delinquent
6


acts.
The

includes
a
jail,
police
or
sheriff’s
station,
7


a
law
enforcement
officer’s
vehicle,
holding
cell,
and
8


correctional
or
detention
facility.
9


The
bill
does
not
require
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
10


obtain
consent
or
inform
the
person
being
interrogated
that
the
11


interrogation
is
being
electronically
recorded.
12


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
a
spontaneous
statement
made
13


outside
the
course
of
the
custodial
interrogation
or
a
14


statement
made
in
response
to
a
question
asked
routinely
during
15


the
processing
of
the
arrest
of
an
individual.
16


The
requirements
of
the
bill
also
do
not
apply
to
17


the
following
situations:
the
electronic
recording
is
18


not
reasonably
feasible
under
the
circumstances,
the
19


individual
refuses
to
participate
in
the
interrogation
20


if
the
interrogation
is
being
recorded,
the
interrogation
21


occurs
in
another
jurisdiction
in
compliance
with
the
other
22


jurisdiction’s
laws
or
by
federal
law
enforcement
in
compliance
23


with
federal
law,
the
law
enforcement
officer
has
no
knowledge
24


of
the
facts
that
would
lead
the
officer
to
reasonably
believe
25


that
the
individual
being
interrogated
committed
an
act
which
26


would
require
the
interrogation
to
be
electronically
recorded,
27


the
law
enforcement
officer
conducting
the
interrogation
28


reasonably
believes
the
electronic
recording
would
disclose
29


the
identity
of
a
confidential
informant
or
jeopardize
the
30


safety
of
an
officer
or
another
individual,
or
the
electronic
31


recording
equipment
fails.
32


If
feasible
under
the
circumstances,
the
bill
requires
the
33


reason
for
not
electronically
recording
an
interrogation
to
be
34


contemporaneously
electronically
recorded.

The
bill
prohibits
a
law
enforcement
officer
from
1


encouraging
an
individual
to
request
an
interrogation
not
be
2


electronically
recorded.
3


If
the
prosecution
relies
on
an
exception
to
not
4


electronically
record
an
interrogation,
the
bill
specifies
that
5


the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
6


the
evidence
that
an
exception
does
apply.
7


The
bill
requires
the
prosecution
to
provide
written
notice
8


to
a
defendant
of
the
intent
to
rely
upon
a
statement
made
in
a
9


custodial
interrogation
which
was
not
electronically
recorded
10


within
40
days
of
arraignment.
11


The
bill
specifies
that
the
court
shall
consider
the
12


failure
to
electronically
record
all
or
part
of
a
custodial
13


interrogation,
unless
an
exception
applies,
as
a
factor
in
14


determining
whether
a
statement
made
during
the
interrogation
15


is
admissible,
including
whether
the
statement
was
voluntarily
16


made.
17


The
bill
requires
each
law
enforcement
agency
to
establish
18


and
enforce
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
electronic
recording
19


is
identifiable,
accessible,
and
preserved
for
a
period
20


of
three
years
after
the
date
of
the
limitation
for
the
21


commencement
of
a
criminal
action
as
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
22


802.
23


The
bill
requires
each
law
enforcement
agency
to
establish
24


rules
relating
to
the
following:
the
manner
in
which
an
25


electronic
recording
is
made
including
the
angle
and
focus
26


of
the
camera,
supervisory
responsibilities,
a
process
27


that
details
when
noncompliance
with
procedures
occurs,
the
28


imposition
of
administrative
sanctions
for
a
failure
to
comply
29


with
the
procedures,
and
a
process
for
monitoring
the
chain
of
30


custody
of
an
electronic
recording.
31


The
bill
does
not
create
a
right
to
require
a
custodial
32


interrogation
to
be
recorded
electronically
or
require
a
33


transcript
of
an
electronically
recorded
interrogation
to
be
34


prepared.

The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
1


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
2


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
3


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
4


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
5


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
6


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
