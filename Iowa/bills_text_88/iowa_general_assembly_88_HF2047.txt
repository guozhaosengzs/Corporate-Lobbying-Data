GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
credit
transactions
3


involving
agricultural
goods
which
include
crops
(e.g.,
grain)
4


and
other
farm
products
usually
governed
by
Iowa’s
version
5


of
the
Uniform
Commercial
Code
(UCC),
Code
chapter
554,
by
6


regulating
the
commercial
relationships
existing
between
7


debtors,
creditors,
and
buyers.
It
also
provides
for
special
8


applicability,
implementation,
and
effective
date
provisions.

WAREHOUSE
DRYING
OR
STORAGE
LIEN.
The
bill
creates
new
10


Code
chapter
571A
which
provides
for
a
special
lien
referred
11


to
as
a
warehouse
drying
or
storage
lien
imposed
in
favor
of
a
12


warehouse
(secured
party
or
lienholder)
upon
a
crop
delivered
13


by
a
debtor
(e.g.,
farmer)
for
reasonable
expenses
relating
to
14


drying
and
storing
the
crop.
During
the
period
that
the
lien
15


is
perfected,
it
has
priority
over
any
competing
creditor’s
16


interest.
Thus,
a
warehouse
could
enforce
the
lien
before
17


all
other
competing
security
interests
and
statutory
liens,
18


including
agricultural
liens,
and
common
law
liens
regardless
19


of
if
or
when
the
competing
security
interest
or
lien
was
20


perfected.
In
this
case,
the
lien
is
created
as
a
possessory
21


lien
in
favor
of
the
warehouse
acting
as
a
special
type
of
22


creditor
serving
as
custodian
and
referred
to
as
a
bailee
23


(see
Code
chapter
554,
article
7).
The
lien
is
automatically
24


perfected
at
the
time
the
warehouse
takes
possession
of
the
25


crop.
The
warehouse’s
special
perfection
status
expires
on
26


March
1
of
the
calendar
year
following
the
calendar
year
that
27


the
debtor
delivered
the
crop
to
the
warehouse.
The
lien
28


is
terminated
when
the
warehouse
relinquishes
possession
of
29


the
crop.
During
the
period
that
the
lien
is
perfected,
the
30


warehouse
may
enforce
the
lien
in
the
same
manner
provided
for
31


perfected
agricultural
liens
under
the
UCC.
The
new
lien
does
32


not
affect
other
possessory
liens,
or
other
security
interests
33


or
agricultural
liens
that
may
be
held
by
the
warehouse.
The
34


lien
is
applicable
to
a
crop
delivered
by
a
debtor
for

1


BACKGROUND.
Under
Iowa’s
version
of
the
UCC,
article
9,
2


a
security
interest
is
created
by
a
contract
referred
to
as
3


a
security
agreement
executed
by
a
creditor
and
debtor
in
4


exchange
for
obtaining
a
loan
(Code
section
554.9201).
The
5


security
interest
is
said
to
attach
to
the
debtor’s
collateral
6


(Code
section
554.9203)
and
based
on
that
agreement
the
7


creditor
may
perfect
the
security
interest
and
obtain
priority
8


over
the
covered
collateral
among
competing
creditors
when
9


enforcing
the
debt
(Code
section
554.9308).
There
are
several
10


ways
in
which
a
creditor
may
perfect
a
security
interest,
11


including
by
possession.
Possession
is
used
to
perfect
a
12


general
warehouse
lien
allowed
under
Code
chapter
554,
article
13


7
(Code
section
554.7209).
More
commonly,
a
security
interest
14


is
perfected
by
filing
a
financing
statement
(referred
to
as
15


a
UCC-1)
with
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
554.9308).
16


In
addition,
various
Code
chapters
existing
outside
the
UCC
17


create
agricultural
liens
in
commodities
produced
by
a
farming
18


operation.
An
agricultural
lien
is
a
statutory
lien
that
19


may
secure
the
payment
of
a
financial
obligation
associated
20


with
commodity
production,
and
is
not
necessarily
possessory,
21


meaning
that
it
may
continue
to
cover
the
commodity
after
22


harvest
and
delivery
(Code
section
554.9102(1)(e)).
An
23


agricultural
lien
is
also
perfected
by
filing
a
financing
24


statement
with
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
554.9338).
25


CENTRALIZED
FILING
SYSTEM.
The
bill
creates
a
centralized,
26


statewide
filing
system
(system)
for
security
interests
in
27


farm
products
to
notify
buyers
of
farm
products
subject
to
an
28


attached
security
interest.
Farm
products
include
goods
other
29


than
standing
timber
produced
as
part
of
a
farming
operation
30


and
includes
crops,
aquatic
goods,
livestock,
supplies
used
31


or
produced
on
the
farming
operation,
or
products
of
crops
or
32


livestock
in
an
unmanufactured
form
(Code
section
554.9102).
33


The
system
must
be
certified
by
the
United
States
department
34


of
agriculture.
The
bill
allows
a
person
who
has
a
secured

interest
attached
to
farm
products
to
complete
and
file
a
1


document
referred
to
as
an
effective
financing
statement
2


or
a
statement
amending,
continuing,
or
terminating
the
3


effective
financing
statement,
with
the
secretary
of
state.
4


The
secretary
must
compile
information
contained
in
the
5


effective
financing
statements
into
a
master
list
organized
6


according
to
farm
products
which
the
secretary
must
regularly
7


distribute
to
buyers
of
farm
products
registered
with
the
8


secretary.
The
secretary
may
also
respond
to
verbal
or
9


written
inquiries
by
buyers
including
unregistered
buyers
and
10


deliver
a
written
confirmation
to
inquiring
buyers
regarding
11


whether
a
farm
product
is
subject
to
a
security
interest.
If
12


a
buyer
registers
with
the
secretary
prior
to
the
purchase
13


of
farm
products,
the
registered
buyer
takes
subject
to
the
14


security
interest
only
if
the
secured
party
has
filed
an
15


effective
financing
statement
that
covers
the
farm
products
16


being
sold,
unless
the
registered
buyer
secures
a
release
of
17


the
security
interest.
If
a
buyer
fails
to
register
with
the
18


secretary,
the
buyer
takes
subject
to
the
security
interest
19


only
if
the
secured
party
has
filed
an
effective
financing
20


statement
that
covers
the
farm
products,
and
the
buyer
could
21


have
discovered
the
existence
of
the
effective
financing
22


statement
by
conducting
an
inquiry
and
receiving
a
response
and
23


confirmation.
The
bill
authorizes
the
secretary
to
establish
24


fees
for
secured
parties
filing
effective
financing
statements
25


and
buyers
registering
with
the
secretary.
The
secretary
must
26


adopt
rules
as
necessary
to
implement,
administer,
and
enforce
27


the
provisions
of
the
system.
The
system
becomes
effective
on
28


the
first
business
day
occurring
90
days
after
certification
by
29


the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
and
publication
of
30


three
successive
notices
in
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin.
31


BACKGROUND.
Article
9
of
the
UCC
provides
an
exception
for
32


buyers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
who
generally
take
33


free
of
a
security
interest
created
by
the
seller
even
in
cases
34


in
which
the
security
interest
has
been
perfected
and
the
buyer

H.F.

is
aware
of
its
existence
(Code
section
554.9320).
However,
1


notwithstanding
this
exception,
a
buyer
who
purchases
a
farm
2


product
from
a
person
engaged
in
farming
operations
may
not
3


take
free
of
a
security
interest.
The
federal
Food
Security
4


Act
of
1985,
in
relevant
part
(7
U.S.C.
§1631),
preempts
the
5


state’s
article
9
requirements
by
providing
that
a
buyer
in
6


the
ordinary
course
of
business,
a
commission
merchant,
or
a
7


selling
agent
(all
classified
under
the
term
“buyer”)
may
buy
8


farm
products
without
being
subject
to
a
security
interest
9


created
by
the
seller
but
only
if
the
buyer
does
not
have
10


actual
or
constructive
notice
of
that
security
interest.
The
11


federal
law
allows
states
to
elect
between
two
notification
12


options:
(1)
Iowa’s
current
law
requiring
the
secured
party
to
13


deliver
direct
notice
to
potential
buyers
of
a
secured
party’s
14


interest
in
the
farm
products
within
one
year
prior
to
sale,
15


or
(2)
the
system
described
in
the
bill.
In
either
case,
the
16


federal
law
does
not
supersede
article
9
requirements
that
17


establish
priorities
among
creditors.
