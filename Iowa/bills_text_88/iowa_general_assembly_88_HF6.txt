Section

3.
a.
The
superintendent
of
a
district
subject
to
a


3


voluntary
diversity
or
court-ordered
desegregation
plan,
as
4


recognized
by
rule
of
the
state
board
of
education,


may
deny
a
5


request
for
transfer
under
this
section
if
the
superintendent
6


finds
that
enrollment
or
release
of
a
pupil
will
adversely
7


affect
the
district’s
implementation
of
the
desegregation
8


order
or
diversity
plan


,
unless
the
transfer
is
requested
9


by
a
pupil
whose
sibling
is
already
participating
in
open
10


enrollment
to
another
district,
or
unless
the
request
for
11


transfer
is
submitted
to
the
district
in
a
timely
manner
as
12


required
under
subsection
2
prior
to
implementation
of


the
13


adoption
of
a


desegregation
plan
order
by
the
district.
If
a
14


transfer
request
would
facilitate
implementation
of
a
voluntary
15


diversity
or
court-ordered
desegregation
plan
order
,
the
16


district
shall
give
priority
to
granting
the
request
over
other
17


requests.
18


b.
A
parent
or
guardian
,


whose
request
has
been
denied
19


because
of
the
district’s
implementation
of
a
the
desegregation
20


order
or
diversity
plan,


may
appeal
the
decision
of
the
21


superintendent
to
the
board
of
the
district
in
which
the
22


request
was
denied.
The
board
may
either
uphold
or
overturn
23


the
superintendent’s
decision.
A
decision
of
the
board
24


to
uphold
the
denial
of
the
request
is
subject
to
appeal
25


to
the
district
court
in
the
county
in
which
the
primary
26


business
office
of
the
district
is
located.
The
state
board


27


of
education
shall
adopt
rules
establishing
definitions,
28


guidelines,
and
a
review
process
for
school
districts
that
29


adopt
voluntary
diversity
plans.
The
guidelines
shall
include


30


criteria
and
standards
that
school
districts
must
follow
31


when
developing
a
voluntary
diversity
plan.
The
department


32


of
education
shall
provide
technical
assistance
to
a
school
33


district
that
is
seeking
to
adopt
a
voluntary
diversity
plan.

H.F.

to
July
1,
2008,
shall
have
until
July
1,
2009,
to
comply
with
1


guidelines
adopted
by
the
state
board
pursuant
to


this
section
.
2


c.
The
board
of
directors
of
a
school
district
subject
3


to
voluntary
diversity
or
court-ordered
desegregation
shall
4


develop
a
policy
for
implementation
of
open
enrollment
in
5


the
district.
The
policy
shall
contain
objective
criteria
6


for
determining
when
a
request
would
adversely
impact
the
7


desegregation
order
or
voluntary
diversity
plan
and
criteria
8


for
prioritizing
requests
that
do
not
have
an
adverse
impact
on
9


the
order
or
plan


.

EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


This
bill
eliminates
implementation
of
a
voluntary
diversity
14


plan
as
a
reason
to
deny
open
enrollment
of
a
pupil.
Under
15


current
law,
a
school
district
subject
to
a
voluntary
diversity
16


plan
or
court-ordered
desegregation
may
deny
a
request
for
17


open
enrollment
of
a
pupil
from
one
district
to
another
if
the
18


superintendent
finds
that
the
enrollment
or
release
of
the
19


pupil
will
adversely
affect
the
district’s
implementation
of
20


the
voluntary
diversity
plan
or
court-ordered
desegregation.
21


The
bill
further
eliminates
provisions
directing
the
state
22


board
of
education
to
adopt
rules
establishing
definitions,
23


guidelines,
and
a
review
process
that
school
districts
must
24


follow
when
adopting
a
voluntary
diversity
plan
and
provisions
25


requiring
the
department
of
education
to
provide
technical
26


assistance
to
school
districts
seeking
to
adopt
a
voluntary
27


diversity
plan.
28


The
bill
also
strikes
obsolete
language.
