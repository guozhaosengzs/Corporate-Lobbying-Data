the
state
public



defender
may
participate
in
a
hearing
on
the
application
by



telephone.



6.
If
the
court
finds
the
payment
of
the
costs
incurred
or



to
be
incurred
by
a
privately
retained
attorney
are
reasonable



and
necessary,
the
order
of
the
court
shall
specify
the
maximum



amount
of

which
the

may
incur
without
further



court
order,
and
that
the

amount
of
such
costs
to
be



allowed
are
subject
to
review
by
the
state
public
defender
for



reasonableness.



7.
Following
entry
of
an
order
allowing

be

representing
an
indigent



person,
the

or
a
claimant
referred
to
in
subsection
9



seeking

or
reimbursement
for
costs
shall
submit
a
claim



for

in
accordance
with
the

of
the

8.
If
the
