detaining
a
person
solely
for

of
Code
6


section
321.37(1)
if

by

14


Since
1997,
Iowa
has
allowed
certain
motor
vehicles
which
15


are
model
year
1948
or
older,
and
certain
reconstructed
or
16


specially
constructed
vehicles
built
to
resemble
vehicles
which
17


are
model
year
1948
or
older,
to
display
one
registration
plate
18


on
the
rear

the
vehicle

the
other
registration
plate
19


issued
to
the
vehicle
is
carried
in
the
vehicle
at
all
times
20


when
the
vehicle
is
operated
on
a
public
highway.
Trucks
21


registered
for
more
than
five
tons,
autocycles,
motorcycles,
22


and
truck

are
excluded

The

registered
24


as

and
motor

to
adding
or
mounting
26


hardware,

adhesives
in

27


front
registration
plate.
Under
Code
section
321.115,
a
motor
28


vehicle
may
register
as
an
antique
vehicle
if
the
vehicle
is
29


25
years
old
or
older.
The
bill
does
not
amend
the
list
of
30


vehicles
excluded
from
the
provision
under
current
law.
