EXPLANATION
7


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


Current
Code
provisions
generally
restrict
school
board
10


members
and
city
and
county
officers
and
employees
from
11


entering
into
contracts
with
the
applicable
governmental
entity
12


or
having
an
interest,
direct
or
indirect,
in
a
contract
with
13


the
entity.
The
prohibition
does
not,
however,
apply
to
14


contracts
if
purchases
benefiting
the
individual
do
not
exceed
15


specified
value
thresholds
in
a
fiscal
year.
The
current
16


thresholds
are
$2,500
for
school
board
members,
$1,500
for
17


county
officers
or
employees,
$1,500
for
officers
or
employees
18


of
a
city
with
a
population
of
more
than
2,500,
and
$2,500
for
19


officers
or
employees
of
a
city
with
a
population
of
2,500
or
20


less.
This
bill
increases
all
such
contract
threshold
amounts
21


to
an
amount
equal
to
the
“allowable
threshold
amount”
in
a
22


fiscal
year.
The
bill
defines
“allowable
threshold
amount”
as
23


an
amount,
in
a
fiscal
year,
equal
to
the
greater
of
$6,000
or
24


an
amount
equal
to
one
percentage
point
more
than
the
allowable
25


threshold
amount
for
the
prior
fiscal
year.
26


By
operation
of
law,
the
threshold
amount
changes
in
the
bill
27


also
apply
to
other
provisions
governing
school
board
members
28


and
provisions
governing
certain
school
organizations
and
clubs
29

Code
section
298A.15,
port
authorities
under
Code
chapter
30


28J,
regional
transit
districts
under
Code
chapter
28M,
and
31


county
enterprise
commissions
under
Code
section
331.471.
