department
of

nonsupervisory
8


peace
officer,
a
nonsupervisory
corrections

14


The

requires
department
employees
who
are
officers
15


to
appoint
a
supervisor
assessment
board
of
up
to
five
members
16


comprised
of
such
employees
for
each
facility,
bureau,
and
17


division
of
the
departments
by
majority
vote
using
a
secret
18


ballot
annually
by
January
1.
19


The
division
requires
each
supervisor
assessment
board
to
20


establish
uniform
assessment
procedures
for
implementing,
21


completing,
collecting
results,
and
preparing
final
reports
of
22


assessments
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
division.
Each
23


supervisor
assessment
board
shall
use
the
same
procedures
24


for
all
supervisors
that
the
assessment
board
assesses
each
25


calendar
year.
Assessments
shall
use
objective
criteria
as
26


determined
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
supervisor
assessment
27


board
to
assess
the
ability,
performance,
and
safety
record
28


of
a
supervisor.
At
least
a
portion
of
the
assessment
shall
29


include
numerical
scoring,
which
shall
be
averaged
for
all
30


supervisor
assessment
board
members
evaluating
a
supervisor.
31


Assessment
procedures
shall
ensure
anonymity
of
each
supervisor
32


assessment

a

if
such
exchange
will,
in
the
judgment
of
the

boards,
improve
the
fairness
of
all
boards
involved.
2


The
division
requires
a
supervisor
assessment
board
to
3


complete
an
assessment
of
each
department
employee
who
is
a
4


supervisor
of
one
or
more
officers
who
appointed
the
assessment
5


board
annually
by
July
1.
Upon
completion
and
scoring
of
6


an
assessment
of
a
supervisor,
the
division
requires
each
7


supervisor
assessment
board
to
prepare
a
report
consisting
8


of
the
complete
results
of
each
supervisor
assessment
board
9


member’s
assessment
and
a
summary
of
the
results
of
all
of
the
10


assessments.
Each
supervisor
assessment
board
member
shall
be
11


given
the
opportunity
to
review
the
report,
which
shall
not
12


become
final
until
it
is
agreed
to
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
13


assessment
board.
The
final
report
shall
be
provided
to
the
14


director
of
the
department.
The
report
shall
be
confidential.
15


The
division
permits
a
supervisor
assessment
board,
by
16


majority
vote,
to
opt
not
to
conduct
any
assessments
in
a
17


calendar
year.
If
the
supervisor
assessment
board
does
so,
18


the
director
of
the
department
shall
designate
one
or
more
19


employees
to
conduct
an
assessment
of
each
supervisor
in
the
20


calendar
year
as
provided
in
the
division.
21


If
a
supervisor
is
determined
by
a
majority
of
members
of
22


the
supervisor
assessment
board
in
a
final
report
to
be
in
23


serious
need
of
improvement
in
any
criterion
used
in
the
report
24


or
to
have
compromised
employee
safety,
the
division
requires
25


the
director
of
the
department
to
discuss
the
matter
with
26


the
supervisor
assessment
board
and
attempt
to
determine
an
27


effective
solution
to
improve
the
supervisor’s
job
performance
28


going
forward.
