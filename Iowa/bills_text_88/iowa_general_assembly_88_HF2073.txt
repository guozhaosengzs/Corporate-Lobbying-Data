An
institution

mental
diseases
refers
to
a
residential
3


or
inpatient
facility
with
more
than
16
beds
in
which
4


individuals
are
primarily
receiving
care
for
a
mental
5


disease
as
specified
by
federal
law.
Traditionally,
Medicaid
6


reimbursement
was
not
available
for
services
provided
in
IMDs
7


for
individuals
between
21

13


provide
Medicaid

1115
waivers

14


short-term
stays
in
IMDs
for
individuals

The
bill
takes
