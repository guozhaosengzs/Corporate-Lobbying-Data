EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
requires
the
department
of
human
services
20


(DHS)
to
modify
the
enrollment
process
for
Medicaid
home
and
21


community-based
services
(HCBS)
waivers.
22


Currently,
the
enrollment
process
allows
an
applicant,
based
23


only
on
the
positive
results
of
a
prescreening
for
eligibility
24


for
Medicaid,
to
request
a
waiver
slot
and,
if
a
slot
is
not
25


available,
to
be
placed
on
an
HCBS
waiver
waiting
list.
Once
a
26


waiver
slot
is
available,
the
individual
then
undergoes
a
level
27


of
care
(LOC)
assessment
and
a
financial
review,
at
which
point
28


the
applicant
may
be
approved
for
or
denied
the
waiver
services
29


based
on
the
results
of
either
the
LOC
assessment
or
financial


30


review.


31


Under
the
bill,
the
enrollment
process
is
modified
32


to
require
that
a
new
applicant
for
HCBS
waiver
services
33


shall
complete
the
eligibility
prescreening,
level
of
care
34


assessment,
and
financial
review,
all
prior
to
requesting

a

or
being
placed
on
a

waiting
list,
to

more

determine
if
the
applicant
is
eligible
for
2


Medicaid
and
the
type
of
waiver
that
will
most
appropriately

address
the
individual’s
needs.
The
bill
requires
DHS
to
4


evaluate
the
modified
enrollment
process
to
determine
if
it
5


results
in
reduced
numbers
of
individuals
on
HCBS

lists
and
more

of
waiver
