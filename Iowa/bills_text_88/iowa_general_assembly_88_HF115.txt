1.
An
issuing
officer
who
finds
that
a
person

a
1


permit

weapons
under
this
chapter
has
been
arrested
2


for

disqualifying
offense

the
person’s
ineligibility

such
permit
,
4


or
determines
the
conditions

the
issuance
of
such
permit


5


no

An

the

become
10


effective

notice.
If


11


the

in
a
disqualifying
conviction
or
finding
against
13


the
permit
holder,
the
issuing
officer

issuing
officer
shall
revoke
the

issuing
officer

later
finds

for
such
a
permit

time

of
issuance
,


or
who
the
officer
finds
provided
materially
21


false
information
on
the
permit
application
,
or
if
the
officer
22


determines
that
the
conditions
for
the
issuance
of
such


23


permit
no
longer
exist

A

If

be
awarded
court
costs
and
reasonable
attorney
fees.
If
the
1


decision
of

deny
an
application
2


for
or
suspend
or
revoke
a
permit
to
carry

or


a
permit

appeal,
5


the
political
subdivision
of

state
representing

EXPLANATION
9


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


This
bill
relates
to
the
issuance,
denial,
suspension,
or
12


revocation
of
a
permit
to
carry
weapons.
13


Current
law
provides
that
the
issuing
officer
(county
14


sheriff
or
commissioner
of
public
safety)
shall
issue
a
permit
15


to
carry
weapons
to
an
applicant
unless
the
applicant
does
16


not
meet
certain
requirements
of
Code
chapter
724
(weapons).
17


The
bill
allows
the
issuing
officer
to
deny
the
issuance
of
18


a
permit
to
carry
weapons
at
the
discretion
of
the
issuing
19


officer
even
if
the
applicant
meets
the
other
requirements
of
20


Code
chapter
724.
21


The
bill
allows
the
issuing
officer
to
suspend
or
revoke
a
22


permit
to
carry
weapons
if
the
issuing
officer
determines
the
23


conditions
for
the
issuance
of
the
permit
to
carry
weapons
no
24


longer
exist.
25


The
bill
strikes
language
that
requires
the
issuing
officer
26


to
reinstate
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
if
the
suspension
of
27


the
permit
is
based
upon
an
arrest
or
proceeding
that
does
not
28


result
in
a
disqualifying
conviction
or
finding
against
the
29


permit
holder.
30


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
appeals
the
decision
by
31


the
issuing
officer
to
deny
an
application
for
a
permit
to
32


carry
weapons
or
who
suspends
or
revokes
a
permit
to
carry
33


weapons,
and
it
is
later
determined
on
appeal
that
the
person
34


is
eligible
to
be
issued
or
possess
a
permit
to
carry
weapons,
35

the
person
shall
be
awarded
court
costs
and
reasonable
attorney
1


fees,
and
if
the
person
loses
or
withdraws
such
an
appeal,
the
2


government
shall
be
awarded
court
costs
and
reasonable
attorney
3


fees.
The
bill
strikes
the
provision
relating
to
awarding
4


court
costs
and
reasonable
attorney
fees
to
the
prevailing
5


party
in
an
appeal
for
the
denial,
suspension,
or
revocation
of
6


a
permit
to
carry
weapons,
but
does
not
strike
the
provision
7


allowing
for
such
an
appeal.
