HEMP
PRODUCTION
——
ACREAGE
LIMITATION.
This
bill
amends
18


Code
chapter
204,
the
Iowa
hemp
Act
(IHA)
(Code
section
204.1),
19


which
in
part
requires
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
20


stewardship
(DALS)
to
regulate
the
production
of
hemp.
Hemp
is
21


defined
as
a
species
of
cannabis
(sativa
L.)
having
a
maximum
22


concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
that
does
not
23


exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent
(Code
section
204.2).
DALS
24


is
required
to
establish
and
administer
a
process
to
issue
25


and
renew
one-year
hemp
licenses
to
qualified
producers
(Code
26


section
204.4).
DALS
may
issue
any
number
of
licenses
to
a
27


qualified
producer
so
long
as
all
licensed
crop
sites
do
not
28


exceed
a
total
of
40
acres.
The
bill
eliminates
the
40-acre
29


limitation.


30

IHA
