H.F.
2045


chapter
204,
the
Iowa
Hemp
Act
(IHA)
(Code
section
204.1),
1


which
in
part
requires
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
2


stewardship
(DALS)
to
regulate
the
production
of
hemp.
Hemp
is
3


defined
as
a
species
of
cannabis
(sativa
L.)
having
a
maximum
4


concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
that
does
not
5


exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent
(Code
section
204.2).
DALS
6


is
required
to
establish
and
administer
a
process
to
issue
7


and
renew
one-year
hemp
licenses
to
qualified
producers
(Code
8


section
204.4).
DALS
may
issue
any
number
of
licenses
to
a
9


qualified
producer
so
long
as
all
licensed
crop
sites
do
not
10


exceed
a
total
of
40
acres.
The
bill
allows
DALS
to
waive
11


the
requirement
limiting
acres
reserved
for
production,
if
at
12


the
time
of
application,
it
determines
that
the
applicant
has
13


entered
into
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
at
least
90
percent
of
14


the
hemp
expected
to
be
harvested
at
the
applicant’s
crop
site.
15


In
addition,
the
harvested
hemp
sold
pursuant
to
the
contract
16


must
be
used
for:
(1)
grain
or
fiber,
or
(2)
seed
to
grow
hemp
17


for
seed
production,
grain,
or
fiber.
DALS
may
require
that
18


the
applicant
provide
any
supporting
materials
to
support
the
19


application.
20


BACKGROUND.
The
IHA
must
comply
with
the
relevant
sections
21


of
the
federal
Agriculture
Improvement
Act
of
2018,
Pub.
22


L.
No.
115-334,
that
allows
states
and
tribes
to
assume
23


primary
regulatory
authority
over
the
production
of
hemp
by
24


submitting
a
plan
for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
25


of
agriculture
(USDA).
DALS
is
required
to
prepare
the
state
26


plan,
any
amended
state
plan,
or
amendment
to
an
approved
27


state
plan,
by
adopting
rules
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
17A
28


(Code
section
204.3).
The
USDA
has
published
interim
rules
to
29


implement
the
federal
legislation
(7
C.F.R.
pt.
990).
The
USDA
30


has
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
Iowa’s
state
plan.
31


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
