Section
1.
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
1


following:
2


1.
“Sex”
is
the
biological
state
of
being
female
or
male,
3


based
on
sex
organs,
chromosomes,
and
endogenous
hormone
4


profiles.
An
individual’s
sex
is
genetically
encoded
into
5


an
individual
at
the
moment
of
conception,
and
it
cannot
be
6


changed.
7


2.
Some
individuals,
including
minors,
may
experience
8


discordance
between
their
sex
and
their
internal
sense
9


of
gender
identity.
Individuals
who
experience
severe
10


psychological
distress
as
a
result
of
this
discordance
may
be
11


diagnosed
with
gender
dysphoria.
12


3.
The
cause
of
the
individual’s
impression
of
discordance
13


between
sex
and
gender
identity
is
unknown.
Diagnosis
is
based
14


exclusively
on
the
individual’s
self-report
of
feelings
and
15


beliefs.
16


4.
This
internal
sense
of
discordance
is
not
permanent
or
17


fixed.
To
the
contrary,
numerous
studies
have
shown
that
a
18


substantial
majority
of
children
who
experience
discordance
19


between
their
sex
and
gender
identity
will
outgrow
the
20


discordance
once
they
go
through
puberty
and
will
eventually
21


have
a
gender
identity
that
aligns
with
their
sex.
22


5.
As
a
result,
taking
a
wait-and-see
approach
to
children
23


who
reveal
signs
of
gender
nonconformity
results
in
a
large
24


majority
of
such
children
resolving
to
a
gender
identity
25


congruent
with
their
sex
by
late
adolescence.
26


6.
Some
in
the
medical
community
are
aggressively
pushing
27


for
interventions
on
children
that
medically
alter
a
child’s
28


hormonal
balance
and
remove
healthy
external
and
internal
sex
29


organs
when
the
child
expresses
a
desire
to
appear
as
a
sex
30


different
from
the
child’s
own.
31


7.
This
course
of
treatment
for
children
commonly
begins
32


with
encouraging
and
assisting
a
child
to
socially
transition
33


to
dressing
and
presenting
as
the
opposite
sex.
In
the
case
34


of
prepubertal
children,
as
puberty
begins,
doctors
then
35


-1-


LSB
5934YH

pf/rh


1/

H.F.
2272


administer
long-acting
gonadotropin-releasing
hormone
(GnRH)
1


agonists
or
puberty
blockers
that
suppress
the
pubertal
2


development
of
the
child.
This
use
of
puberty
blockers
for
3


gender
nonconforming
children
is
experimental
and
not
approved
4


by
the
United
States
food
and
drug
administration.
5


8.
After
puberty
is
blocked,
the
child
is
administered
6


cross-sex
hormonal
treatments
that
induce
the
development
7


of
secondary
sex
characteristics
of
the
other
sex,
such
as
8


causing
the
development
of
breasts
and
wider
hips
in
male
9


children
taking
estrogen
and
greater
muscle
mass,
bone
density,
10


body
hair,
and
a
deeper
voice
in
female
children
taking
11


testosterone.
Some
children
are
administered
these
hormones
12


independent
of
any
prior
pubertal
blockade.
13


9.
The
final
phase
of
treatment
is
for
the
child
to
undergo
14


cosmetic
and
other
surgical
procedures,
often
to
create
an
15


appearance
similar
to
that
of
the
opposite
sex.
These
surgical
16


procedures
may
include
a
mastectomy
to
remove
a
female
child’s
17


breasts
and
bottom
surgery
that
removes
a
child’s
healthy
18


reproductive
organs
and
creates
an
artificial
form
aiming
to
19


approximate
the
appearance
of
the
genitals
of
the
opposite
sex.
20


10.
For
children
who
are
placed
on
puberty
blockers
that
21


inhibit
their
bodies
from
experiencing
the
natural
process
of
22


sexual
development,
the
overwhelming
majority
will
continue
23


down
a
path
toward
cross-sex
hormones
and
cosmetic
surgery.
24


11.
This
unproven,
poorly
studied
series
of
interventions
25


results
in
numerous
harmful
effects
for
children,
as
well
as
26


risks
of
effects
simply
unknown
due
to
the
new
and
experimental
27


nature
of
these
interventions.


28


12.
Among
the
known
harms
from
puberty
blockers
are
29


diminished
bone
density.
The
full
effect
of
puberty
blockers
30


on
brain
development
and
cognition
are
yet
unknown,
though
31


reason
for
concern
is
now
present.
There
is
no
research
on
the
32


long-term
risks
to
children
of
persistent
exposure
to
puberty
33


blockers.
With
the
administration
of
cross-sex
hormones
comes


34


increased
risks
of
cardiovascular
disease,
thromboembolic


35


-2-

stroke,
asthma,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease,
and
1


cancer.
2


13.
Puberty
blockers
prevent
gonadal
maturation
and
thus
3


render
children
taking
these
drugs
infertile.
Introducing
4


cross-sex
hormones
to
children
with
immature
gonads
as
a
5


direct
result
of
pubertal
blockade
is
expected
to
cause
6


irreversible
sterility.
Sterilization
is
also
permanent
for
7


those
who
undergo
surgery
to
remove
reproductive
organs,
8


and
such
children
are
likely
to
suffer
through
a
lifetime
9


of
complications
from
the
surgery,
infections,
and
other
10


difficulties
requiring
yet
more
medical
intervention.
11


14.
Several
studies
demonstrate
that
hormonal
and
surgical
12


interventions
often
do
not
resolve
the
underlying
psychological
13


issues
affecting
the
individual.
For
example,
individuals
14


who
undergo
cross-sex
cosmetic
surgical
procedures
have
been
15


found
to
suffer
from
elevated
mortality
rates
from
medical
16


and
psychological
conditions.
Their
suicide
rate
is
nineteen
17


times
higher
than
the
general
population.
They
experience
18


significantly
higher
rates
of
substance
abuse,
depression,
and
19


psychiatric
hospitalizations.
20


15.
Children,
and
often
their
parents,
are
unable
to
21


comprehend
and
fully
appreciate
the
risk
and
life
implications,
22


including
permanent
sterility,
that
result
from
the
use
of
23


puberty
blockers,
cross-sex
hormones,
and
surgical
procedures.
24


16.
For
these
reasons,
the
decision
to
pursue
a
course
of
25


hormonal
and
surgical
interventions
to
address
a
discordance
26


between
an
individual’s
sex
and
sense
of
gender
identity
27


should
not
be
presented
to
or
determined
for
children
who
28


are
incapable
of
comprehending
the
negative
implications
and
29


life-course
difficulties
resulting
from
these
interventions.
