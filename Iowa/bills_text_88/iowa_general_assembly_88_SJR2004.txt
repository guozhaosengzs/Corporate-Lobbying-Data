WHEREAS,
honeybees
(apis

in

were
brought
to
the

hemisphere;

bees
pollinate
approximately

States;
and
10

one-third
of
the

pollination,
80
percent
of
which
is
due
to
12


honeybees;
and
13


WHEREAS,
tiny
as
they
are,
honeybees
play
a
key
role
in

with

pollination
performed

15


honeybees
valued
at
an
estimated
$92

and
16


WHEREAS,
approximately
4,500
Iowa
beekeepers
manage
around
17


45,000
colonies
of
honeybees
that
produce
over
4
million
pounds
18


of
honey
annually;
and
19


WHEREAS,
limited

in
Clarion,
Iowa,
revealed
