who
has
not
been
required
to
submit



a
DNA
sample
for
DNA
profiling
may
make
a
motion
an
application



to
the
court
for
an
order
to
require
that
DNA
analysis





profiling


be
performed
on
evidence
a
forensic
sample
collected



in
the
case
for
which
the
person
stands
convicted.



2.
The
motion


application
shall
state
the
following:



a.
The
specific
crimes
for
which
the
defendant
stands



convicted
in
this
case.



b.
The
facts
of
the
underlying
case,
as
proven
at
trial
or



admitted
to
during
a
guilty
plea
proceeding.



c.
Whether
any
of
the
charges
include
sexual
abuse
or



involve
sexual
assault,
and
if
so,
whether
a
sexual
assault



examination
was
conducted

evidence


forensic
samples
were



preserved,
if
known.



d.
Whether
identity
was
at
issue
or
contested
by
the



defendant.



e.
Whether
the
defendant
offered
an
alibi,
and
if
so,



testimony
corroborating
the
alibi
and,
from
whom.



f.
Whether
eyewitness
testimony
was
offered,
and
if
so
from



whom.

have
been
raised
in
the
past
or
are
being
raised
by
the
motion





application

have
tested.



k.
Why
the
requested
analysis
of
DNA
evidence


DNA
profiling



of
the
forensic
sample
is
material
to
the
issue
in
the
case
and



not
merely
cumulative
or
impeaching.



l.
Why
the
DNA
evidence


profiling
results
would
have



changed
the
outcome

proceeding
for
relief
filed
under

took
place.
A
record

be
made.



4.
Any
DNA
profiling
of
the
defendant
or
other
biological



evidence
testing
conducted
by
the
state

defendant



shall
be
disclosed
and
the
results
of
such
profiling
or
testing



described
in
the
motion


application
or
answer.



5.
If
the
evidence
forensic
sample
requested
to
be
tested



was
previously
subjected
to
DNA
or
other
biological
analysis



by
either
party,
the
court
may
order
the
disclosure
of
the



results
of
such
testing,
including
laboratory
reports,
notes,



and
underlying
data,
to
the
court
and
the
parties.



6.
The
court
may
order
a
hearing

forensic
sample
should
be



subjected

DNA
analysis
profiling
.



7.
The
court
shall
grant
the
motion
if
all
of
the
following



apply:





a.
The
evidence
subject
to
DNA
testing
is
available
and
in
a



condition
that
will
permit
analysis.





b.
A
sufficient
chain
of
custody
has
been
established
for



the
evidence.





c.
The
identity
of
the
person
who
committed
the
crime
for



which
the
defendant
was
convicted
was
a
significant
issue
in





the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
convicted.



d.


The
evidence
subject
to
DNA
analysis
is
material
to,
and



not
merely
cumulative

impeaching
of,
evidence
included
in



the
trial
record
or
admitted
to
at
a
guilty
plea
proceeding.

e.


DNA
analysis
of
the
evidence
would
raise
a
reasonable



probability
that
the
defendant
would
not
have
been
convicted
if



DNA
profiling
had
been
available
at
the
time
of

of
three
years
beyond
the



limitations
for
the
commencement
of

section
that
the
results
indicate
conclusively



that
the
DNA
profile
of
the
defendant
matches
the
profile
from





the
analyzed
evidence
used
against
the
defendant,
the
court



may
order
the
defendant
to
pay
the
costs
of

for



the
forensic
sample.



c.
