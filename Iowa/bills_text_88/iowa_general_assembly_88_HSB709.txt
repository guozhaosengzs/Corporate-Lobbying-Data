EXPLANATION
18


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
19


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
20


This
bill
provides
deductions
from
the
individual
and
21


corporate
income
taxes
for
business
expenses
incurred
by
22


medical
cannabidiol
manufacturers.
23


Under
federal
law,
a
medical
cannabidiol
manufacturer
is
24


prohibited
from
taking
business
expense
deductions
by
section
25


280E
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
Currently,
Iowa
computes
26


individual
net
income
and
corporate
taxable
income
based
upon
27


federal
income
calculations,
and
therefore
Iowa
currently
28


prohibits
a
medical
cannabidiol
manufacturer
from
taking
29


business
expense
deductions
as
well
because
the
deductions
are
30


not
allowed
at
the
federal
level.
31


The
bill
allows
a
medical
cannabidiol
manufacturer
licensed


32


pursuant
to
Code
chapter
124E
to
deduct
business
expenses
for
33


purposes
of
the
Iowa
individual
income
tax
or
corporate
income
34


tax.
