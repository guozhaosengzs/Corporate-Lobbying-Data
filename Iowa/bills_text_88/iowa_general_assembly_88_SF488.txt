23


Similar
to
the

districts,
24


the
division
provides
an
exemption
to
an

career

26


technical,

courses
that
meet
unit


27


requirements
under
the
state’s
educational
standards.
28


Students
enrolled
under
such
an
agreement
shall
be
counted
29


as
if
the
student
was
assigned
a
concurrent
enrollment
30


weighting
under
Code
section
257.11(3)(b),
in
determining
the
31

6


The
division
requires
the
community
college
that
enters
7


into
a
contract
to
provide
the
department
with
a
list
of
8


the
accredited
nonpublic
school
students
enrolled,
and
to
9


verify
that
the
coursework
meets
concurrent

program
10


requirements.
The
department
is
directed
to
calculate,
using
11


the
state
cost
per
pupil,
and
pay
to
the
community
college
an
12


amount
equivalent
to
the
amount
of
supplementary
weighting
a
13


school
district
would
receive
for
enrolling
such
students.
14


The
division
establishes
a
standing,
unlimited
appropriation
15


for
each
fiscal
year
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2019,
from
16


the
general
fund
of
the
state
to
the
department
of
education,
17


in
an
amount
necessary
to
make
payments
to
community
colleges
18


for
the
concurrent
enrollment
of
accredited
nonpublic
school
19


students
under
a
contract.
20


Community
colleges
are
directed
to
decrease
the

21


billed
to
the

by
the
amount
22


calculated
and
paid
to
the
community
college
from
