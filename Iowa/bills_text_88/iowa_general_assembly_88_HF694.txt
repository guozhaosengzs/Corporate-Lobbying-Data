to
challenge



by
any
person
for
a
period
of
thirty
days

change
to
a
rule.
A
challenge
shall
be



made
in
writing,
and
delivered
to
the
chair
of
the

Oversight,
dispute
resolution,
and
enforcement.



a.
Oversight.



(1)
The
executive,
legislative,
and
judicial
branches



of
state
government
in
each
member
state
shall
enforce
this



compact
and
take
all
actions
necessary
and
appropriate
to



effectuate
the
compact’s
purposes
and
intent.
The
provisions



of
this
compact
and
the
rules
promulgated
hereunder
shall
have



standing
as
statutory
law.



(2)
All
courts
shall
take
judicial
notice
of
the
compact



and
the
rules
in
any
judicial
or
administrative
proceeding
in
a



member
state
pertaining
to
the
subject
matter
of
this
compact



which
may
affect
the
powers,
responsibilities,
or
actions
of



the
commission.



(3)
The
commission
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
service



of
process
in
any
such
proceeding,
and
shall
have
standing
to




House
File
694,
p.
19


intervene
in
such
a
proceeding
for
all
purposes.
Failure
to



provide
service
of
process
to
the
commission
shall
render
a



judgment
or
order
void
as
to
the
commission,
this
compact,
or



promulgated
rules.



b.
Default,
technical
assistance,
and
termination.



(1)
If
the
commission
determines
that
a
member
state



has
defaulted
in
the
performance
of
its
obligations
or



responsibilities
under
this
compact
or
the
promulgated
rules,



the
commission
shall:



(a)
Provide
written
notice
to
the
defaulting
state
and
other



member
states
of
the
nature
of
the
default,
the
proposed
means



of
curing
the
default
and/or
any
other
action
to
be
taken
by



the
commission;
and

remedial
training
and
specific
technical



assistance
regarding

the



defaulting
state
may
be
terminated
from

affirmative
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
member
states,
and
all



rights,
privileges,
and
benefits
conferred
by
this
compact
may



be
terminated
on
the
effective
date
of
termination.
A
cure
of



the
default
does
not
relieve
the
offending
state
of
obligations



or
liabilities
incurred
during
the
period
of
default.



(3)
Termination
of
membership
in
the
compact
shall
be



imposed
only
after
all
other
means
of
securing
compliance
have



been
exhausted.
Notice
of
intent
to
suspend
or
terminate
shall



be
given
by
the
commission
to
the
governor,
the
majority
and



minority
leaders
of
the
defaulting
state’s
legislature,
and



each
of
the
member
states.



(4)
A
state
that
has
been
terminated
is
responsible
for



all
assessments,
obligations,
and
liabilities
incurred
through



the
effective
date
of
termination,
including
obligations
that



extend
beyond
the
effective
date
of
termination.



(5)
The
commission
shall
not
bear
any
costs
related



to
a
state
that
is
found
to
be
in
default
or
that
has
been





terminated
from
the
compact,
unless
agreed
upon
in
writing



between
the
commission
and
the
defaulting
state.



(6)
The
defaulting
state
may
appeal
the
action
of
the



commission
by
petitioning
the
United
States
district
court



for
the
District
of
Columbia
or
the
federal
district
where

has
its
principal

litigation,
including



reasonable
attorney’s

c.
Dispute
resolution.



(1)

request
by
a
member
state,

and

member

for
disputes
as



appropriate.

majority
vote,
the
commission
may
initiate
legal



action
in
the
United
States
district
court
for
the
District



of
Columbia
or
the
federal
district
where
the
commission
has



its
principal
offices
against
a
member
state
in
default
to



enforce
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
compact
and
its



promulgated
rules
and
bylaws.
The
relief
sought
may
include



both
injunctive
relief
and
damages.
In
the
event
judicial



enforcement
is
necessary,
the
prevailing
member
shall
be



awarded
all
costs
of
