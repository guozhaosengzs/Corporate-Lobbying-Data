2.
The
protections
provided
to
a

contractor,

under

chapter
do
not

in

person
other
than
the
employer,

if,
on

the
date
the

hired,
the

EXPLANATION
23


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
25


This
bill
relates
to
the
following
causes
of
actions:
26


negligent
hiring
and
failure
to
adequately
supervise.
The
bill
27


does
not
expand
or
create
any
causes
of
action.
28


Under
current
law,
the
torts
of
negligent
hiring
and
29


supervision
allow
a
person
injured
by
an
employee
to
sue
the
30


employee’s
employer
even
though
the
act
was
committed
outside
31


the
scope
of
the
employment
due
to
some
fault
resting
with
the
32


employer
for
hiring
the
employee,
or
failing
to
supervise
the
33


employee.
34


The
bill
provides
that
the
causes
of
action
of
negligent
35

hiring
and
negligent
supervision
shall
not
be
brought
against
a
1


private
employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
owner
solely
2


based
on
evidence
that
the
employee,
agent,
or
independent
3


contractor
has
been
convicted
of
a
public
offense.
However,
4


the
bill
does
not
preclude
causes
of
action
for
negligent
5


hiring
or
negligent
supervision
of
an
employee,
agent,
or
6


independent
contractor,
if
two
criteria
are
met.
First,
the
7


private
employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
owner
knew
or
8


should
have
known
of
the
conviction;
and
second,
the
employee,
9


agent,
or
independent
contractor
was
convicted
of
a
public
10


offense
enumerated
in
the
bill
or
a
public
offense
that
was
11


committed
while
performing
duties
substantially
similar
to
12


those
reasonably
expected
to
be
performed
in
the
employment,
13


or
under
the
relationship
or
contract,
or
under
conditions
14


substantially
similar
to
those
reasonably
expected
to
be
15


encountered
in
the
employment
or
the
relationship
or
contract,
16


taking
into
consideration
enumerated
factors
set
forth
in
the
17


bill.
18


The
bill
provides
that
the
protections
provided
to
a
private
19


employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
owner
do
not
apply
20


in
a
suit
concerning
the
misuse
of
funds
or
property
of
a
21


person
other
than
the
employer,
general
contractor,
or
premises
22


owner,
by
an
employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
if,
on
23


the
date
the
employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
was
24


hired,
the
employee,
agent,
or
independent
contractor
had
been
25


convicted
of
a
public
offense
that
included
fraud
or
the
misuse
26


of
funds
or
property
as
an
element
of
the
public
offense,
and
27


it
was
foreseeable
that
the
position
for
which
the
employee,
28


agent,
or
independent
contractor
was
hired
would
involve
29


discharging
a
fiduciary
responsibility
in
the
management
of
30


funds
or
property.
31


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
the
employment
of
