the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
the
treatment
of
certain
income
as
a
2


foreign
dividend
for
Iowa
corporate
income
tax
purposes,
and
3


modifies
the
business
expense
deduction
for
Iowa
individual
and
4


corporate
tax
purposes.
5


FOREIGN
DIVIDEND
INCOME.
Federal
law
includes
in
a
6


taxpayer’s
gross
income
global
intangible
low-taxed
income
7


(GILTI)
as
defined
in
section
951A
of
the
Internal
Revenue
8


Code,
subject
to
a
deduction
equal
to
50
percent
of
the
9


corporation’s
GILTI
under
section
250(a)(1)(B)
of
the
Internal
10


Revenue
Code.
The
amendment
to
Code
section
422.35(21)
directs
11


corporate
taxpayers
to
treat
the
taxpayer’s
net
GILTI
amount
as
12


a
foreign
dividend
for
Iowa
income
tax
purposes,
meaning
the
13


taxpayer
qualifies
for
the
same
dividends
received
deduction
14


that
applies
to
subpart
F
income
and
other
foreign
dividends.
15


BUSINESS
INTEREST
EXPENSE
DEDUCTION.
The
federal
Tax
Cuts
16


and
Jobs
Act
(TCJA)
created
a
new
limitation
on
the
deduction
17


of
business
interest
expense
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
18


after
January
1,
2018.
Currently,
the
state
couples
with
19


federal
law
limiting
the
deduction
of
business
interest
expense
20


for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2019.
21


The
bill
decouples,
for
Iowa
individual
and
corporate
income
22


tax
purposes,
from
the
federal
limitation
on
deduction
of
23


business
interest
expenses
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
24


January
1,
2019.
25


The
decoupling
from
the
federal
limitation
on
deduction
26


of
business
interest
expense
does
not
apply
during
any
tax
27


year
in
which
the
additional
first-year
depreciation
allowance
28


authorized
in
section
168(k)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
29


(bonus
depreciation)
applies
in
computing
net
income
for
state
30


tax
purposes.
31


For
any
tax
year
in
which
a
taxpayer
is
not
permitted
to
32


deduct
any
amount
of
interest
expense
paid
or
accrued
in
a
33


previous
taxable
year
due
to
the
allowance
of
the
additional
34


first-year
depreciation,
the
bill
prohibits
the
deduction
of

of
the

Code,
if

in

interest

was
originally
paid
