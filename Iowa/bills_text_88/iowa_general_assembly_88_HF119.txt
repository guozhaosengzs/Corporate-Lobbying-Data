Annually,
$24
million
and
the
balance
of
the
property
tax
1


equity
and
relief
fund
are
appropriated
to
provide
adjusted
2


additional
property
tax
levy
aid
to
school
districts
in
an
3


amount
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
adjusted
additional
4


property
tax
levy
rate
and
the
statewide
maximum
adjusted
5


additional
property
tax
levy
rate,
as
calculated
by
the
6


department
of
management.
Current
law
provides
that
the
7


statewide
maximum
adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
rate
8


is
calculated
using
the
amounts
appropriated,
but
not
to
9


exceed
the
statewide
average
additional
property
tax
levy
rate
10


calculated
by
dividing
the
total
adjusted
additional
property
11


tax
levy
dollars
statewide
by
the
statewide
total
net
taxable
12


valuation.
This
bill
provides
that
the
statewide
maximum
13


adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
rate,
as
calculated
by
14


the
department
of
management,
shall
instead
not
be
less
than
15


the
lowest
adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
rate
among
all
16


school
districts
in
the
state.
Accordingly,
the
bill
allows
17


for
lowering
all
school
district
adjusted
additional
property
18


tax
levy
rates
to
the
lowest
adjusted
additional
property
tax
19


levy
rate
among
all
school
districts
in
the
state
if
sufficient
20


funding
is
appropriated.
21


The
bill
applies
July
1,
2020,
for
school
budget
years
22


beginning
on
or
after
that
date.
