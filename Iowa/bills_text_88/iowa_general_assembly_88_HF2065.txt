EXPLANATION

4


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
5


This
bill
relates
to
certain
tax
credits
and
assistance
6


awarded
under
the
high
quality
jobs
program
by
the
economic
7


development
authority
to
eligible
businesses,
including
those
8


in
rural
communities.
9


The
bill
provides
for
tax
incentives
for
eligible
businesses
10


in
rural
communities.
“Rural
community”
is
defined
in
the
bill
11


as
a
city
located
in
this
state
with
a
population
of
30,000
or
12


less
in
a
county
with
a
population
of
50,000
or
less.
If
the
13


rural
community
is
located
in
more
than
one
county,
the
rural
14


community
is
considered
to
be
located
in
the
county
that
has
15


the
greatest
taxable
base
within
the
city.
The
tax
incentives
16


are
based
upon
the
number
of
jobs
created
or
retained
that
pay
17


at
least
110
percent
of
the
qualifying
wage
threshold
and
the
18


amount
of
the
qualifying
investment.
The
tax
incentives
are
19


based
upon
a
schedule
as
detailed
in
the
bill.
20


The
bill
also
details
the
requirements
for
a
community
21


match,
based
on
the
size
of
the
community,
in
order
for
an
22


eligible
business
to
be
awarded
assistance
by
the
authority
23


from
the
fund
created
in
Code
section
15.335B.
24


The
bill
directs
the
authority
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
25


the
high
quality
jobs
program.
26


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
