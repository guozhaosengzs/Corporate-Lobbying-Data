EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


This
bill
provides
more
options
by
which
an
instructor
may
5


qualify
to
teach
at
a
community
college
in
the
subject
area
6


of
career
and
technical
education
(CTE).
The
bill
permits
an
7


instructor
to
teach
CTE
classes
at
a
community
college
if
the
8


instructor
possesses
a
baccalaureate
degree
in
any
area
if
at
9


least
18
of
the
credit
hours
completed
were
in
the
CTE
field
10


in
which
the
instructor
teaches;
or
possesses
an
associate
11


degree
in
the
CTE
field
of
instruction
in
which
the
person
is
12


teaching,
if
such
degree
is
considered
terminal
for
that
field
13


of
instruction,
and
the
instructor
has
at
least
3,000
hours
of
14


recent
and
relevant
work
experience
in
the
area
in
which
the
15


instructor
teaches
classes.
16


Currently,
an
instructor
must
have
a
baccalaureate
or
17


graduate
degree
relating
to
the
area
in
which
the
instructor
is
18


teaching
classes
or,
if
the
instructor
possesses
less
than
a
19


baccalaureate
degree,
must
have
special
training
and
at
least
20


6,000
hours
of
recent
and
relevant
work
experience
in
the
area
21


in
which
the
instructor
teaches
classes.
In
the
latter
case,
22


if
the
instructor
is
a
licensed
practitioner
who
holds
a
career
23


and
technical
endorsement
under
Code
chapter
272,
classroom
24


instruction
can
be
used
to
meet
the
requirement
relating
to
25


relevant
work
experience,
and
the
bill
applies
this
language
to
26


the
new
option
as
well.
