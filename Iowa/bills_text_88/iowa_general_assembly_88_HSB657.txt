TAX
YEAR.
Current
law
provides
nine
regular
tax
8


brackets
containing
progressively
higher
amounts
of
taxable
9


income
that
are
taxed
at
progressively
higher
tax
rates,
from

a
low
of
0.33
percent,
to

of

The

and
increased
each
year.
For
tax
years
beginning
on

after
13


January
1,
2021,
the
bill
reduces
the
tax

in

YEAR.
Commencing
with
the
tax
year
17


beginning
January

2023,
the
bill
reduces
the
number
of
18


individual

brackets
to

and
reduces
the
tax
19


rates
in
the
aggregate
if
certain
net
tax
receipt
revenue
20


targets
are
met
or
exceeded
as
described
in
division

the
bill.
For
a
married
couple
filing
a
joint

the
22


taxable
income

are
doubled.
23


The
taxable
income

The

Current
Iowa
law

on
a

return
so
there
are
no
separate
tax
brackets
for

a

filing
a
joint
return.
However,
the
ability
9


for
married
persons
to
file
separately
on
a
combined
return
10


is
repealed
in
the
“trigger
year”
in
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
11


1161,
due
to
the
starting
point
to
calculate
Iowa
income
taxes
12


moving
from
federal
adjusted
gross
income
to
federal
taxable
13


income,

married

DIVISION

——
CHILD
AND
DEPENDENT
CARE
AND

16


TAX
CREDITS.
Currently,
an
individual
may
claim
30
percent
of
17


the
federal
child
and
dependent
care
credit
provided
in
section
18


21
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
against
the
individual
income
19


tax
if
the
individual’s
net
income
is
less
than
$45,000.
Under
20


the
bill,
an
individual
may
claim
30
percent
of
the
federal
21


child
and
dependent
care
credit
provided
in
section
21
of
the
22


Internal
Revenue
Code
against
the
individual
income
tax
if
the
23


individual’s
net
income
is
less
than
$90,000.
24


The
bill
also
increases
the
income
threshold
determining
the
25


eligibility
of
a
taxpayer
for
the
early
childhood
development
26


tax
credit.
The
bill
increases
the
eligibility
threshold
from
27


a
taxpayer
whose
net
income
is
less
than
$45,000
per
year
to
28


less
than
$90,000
per
year.
By
increasing
the
eligibility
29


threshold,
taxpayers
whose
net
income
is
less
than
$90,000
are
30


now
eligible
to
take
the
early
childhood
development
tax
credit
31


equaling
25
percent
of
the
first
$1,000
which
the
taxpayer
has
32


paid
to
others
for
early
childhood
development
expenses
for
33


each
dependent

three
through
five.

——
SALES

TAX.
An
amendment
to
the
Iowa
30


Constitution
was
ratified
on
November
2,
2010,
which
created


31


a
natural
resources

trust
fund
(fund)
32


and
dedicated
a
portion
of
state

for
33

(article
VII,
section
10).
The
fund
is
codified
in
2


Code
section
461.31.
Pursuant
to
the
amendment,
the
amount
3


credited
to
the
fund
will
be
equal
to
the
amount
generated
4


by
an
increase
in
the
state
sales
tax
rate
occurring
after
5


the

constitutional
amendment,
but
shall
6


not
exceed
the
amount
that
a
state
sales
tax
rate
of
0.375

percent
would
generate.
The
state
sales
tax
rate
has
not
8


been
increased
since
the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
9


amendment,
so
no
amounts
have
been
credited
to
the
fund.
The
10


bill
increases
the
sales
tax
rate
and
the
use
tax
rate
from
6
11


percent
to
7
percent
on
January

the
moneys
from
the
natural

fund
in
another
part
of
the
bill.
The
bill
also
amends
14


the
transfer
of
sales

use
tax
revenues
to
the

15


advanced

it
did
prior
to

increases
provided

DIVISION
VII
——
WATER
SERVICE
TAX
REPEAL.
Currently,
an
20


excise
tax
at
the
rate
of
6
percent
is
imposed
on
the

from
the
sale
or
furnishing

a
water
utility
of
a
water

service

The

and
replaces
the
current
future
repeal
provisions
of
the
water

in
Code
section
423G.7
and
provides
that
the
water
25


service

is
repealed
January
1,
2021.
26


The
amendment
to
Code
section
421.71
specifies
that
the
27


applicable
law
related
to
a
private
cause
of
action
associated
28


with
the
collection

that

established
in

The

strikes

county

therefore
16


allowing
