Findings.

1.
The
state
of
Iowa
has
long
recognized
that
mentally
2


capable
adults
have
a
fundamental
right
to
determine
their
own
3


medical
treatment
options
in
accordance
with
their
own
values,
4


beliefs,
and
personal
preferences.
5


2.
The
state
of
Iowa
wants
to
uphold
both
the
highest
6


standard
of
medical
care
and
the
full
range
of
options
for
each
7


individual,
particularly
at
the
end
of
life.
8


3.
Terminally
ill
individuals
may
undergo
unremitting
9


pain,
agonizing
discomfort,
and
a
sudden,
continuing,
and
10


irreversible
reduction
in
their
quality
of
life
at
the
end
of
11


life.
12


4.
The
availability
of
medical
aid
in
dying
provides
13


an
additional
palliative
care
option
for
terminally
ill
14


individuals
who
seek
to
retain
their
autonomy
and
some
level
of
15


control
over
the
progression
of
the
illness
as
they
near
the
16


end
of
life
or
to
ease
unnecessary
pain
and
suffering.
17


5.
Integration
of
medical
aid
in
dying
into
standard
18


end-of-life
care
has
demonstrably
improved
the
quality
of
19


services
delivered
to
terminally
ill
individuals
by
enhancing
20


palliative
care
training
of
providers,
prompting
development
21


and
enhancement
of
palliative
care
service
delivery
systems,
22


and
promoting
more
in-depth
conversations
between
providers
23


and
terminally
ill
individuals
about
the
full
range
of
care
24


options
leading
to
more
appropriate
end-of-life
care
planning,
25


including
increased
hospice
use.
26


6.
The
state
of
Iowa
affirms
that
an
attending
provider
27


who
respects
and
honors
a
terminally
ill
patient’s
values
28


and
priorities
for
that
terminally
ill

and
has
been

determined
by
the

to
be
terminally
ill,
to
request
medication
that
the
8


patient
may
self-administer

Such

patient
must
make
two
oral
requests
to
the
patient’s
attending
10


provider,
followed

must
be
substantially
made,

oral

written
14


requests
must
be
made

the

patient
will,
within
reasonable
medical
judgment,
die
20


within
15
days
after
making
the
initial
oral
request,
the

terminally

the
oral
request
to
the
22


attending
provider
at
any
time
after
making
the
initial
oral
23


request
and
the
15-day
waiting
period
shall
be
waived.

The

specifies
the
duties
of
the
attending
provider
and
25


the
consulting
provider,
and
provides

terminally
ill
patient
by
either
an
attending
provider
or
a
27


consulting
provider
to

licensed
mental
health
provider
to
28


confirm
that
the
terminally
ill
patient
requesting
medication
29


for
medical
aid
in
dying
is
mentally
capable.

17


relative

of

and
informed

18


requirements;
and
provides
that
the

is
not
to
