made
and
continue
to
make

economies
by

increasing

the
current
23


presidential

announced

and
1


WHEREAS,
several
courts
have
blocked
the
plan
to
2


phase

the
DACA
program
and
have
ordered
United
3


States
Citizenship
and
Immigration
Services
to
continue
4


accepting
and
processing
renewal
applications;
and
5


WHEREAS,
Temporary
Protected
Status
(TPS)
is
a
6


temporary
status
granted
by
the
government
that
allows
7


a
person
to
live
and
work
in
the
United
States
and
is
8


given
to
eligible
nationals
of
designated
countries
9


afflicted
by
natural
disasters,
war,
or
other
dangerous
10


conditions;
and
11


WHEREAS,
according
to
the
Pew
Research
Center,
TPS
12


currently
protects
approximately
320,000
people
in
the
13


United
States
from
10
countries
who
would
otherwise
be
14


deported
to
areas
suffering
from
disease,
violence,
15


starvation,
the
aftermath
of
natural
disasters,
and
16


other
life-threatening
conditions;
and
17


WHEREAS,
according
to
the
Pew
Research
Center,
the
18


largest
group
of
TPS
recipients
is
from
El
Salvador
19


(195,000
people),
followed
by
Honduras
(57,000
people)
20


and
Haiti
(50,000
people);
and
21


WHEREAS,
most
TPS
holders
in
Iowa
are
from
El
22


Salvador
and
Honduras
and
they,
and
their
families,
23


have
been
significant,
contributing
members
of
24


their
communities
and
local
economies
for
nearly
20
25


years;
and
26


WHEREAS,
according
to
the
Immigrant
Legal
Resource
27


Center,
ending
TPS
will
devastate
the
United
States
28


economy
as
deporting
TPS
recipients
from
El
Salvador,
29


Honduras,
and
Haiti
would
cost
taxpayers
over
$3

billion.
Over
a
decade,
the
inability
of
these
1


individuals
to
work
would
result
in
over
$45
billion
2


in
lost
gross
domestic
product
and
$6.9
billion
in
3


lost
Social
Security
and
Medicare
contributions.
4


Moreover,
employers
would
incur
close
to
$1
billion
in
5


turnover
costs
for
the
wholesale
termination
of
TPS
6


recipients;
and
7


WHEREAS,
terminating
TPS
before
countries
are
8


sufficiently
recovered
will
have
a
profoundly
9


destabilizing
effect
which
will
be
felt
in
countries
10


in
need,
by
their
neighbors,
and
at
the
United
States
11


borders,
as
more
people
flee
their
countries
to
save
12


their
lives
and
the
lives
of
their
families;
and
13


WHEREAS,
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
has
14


already
denied
extension
of
TPS
status
to
several
15


countries,
which
means
that
current
recipients
will
16


lose
their
ability
to
work
legally
in
the
United
States
17


and
will
be
at
risk
of
being
deported
back
to
dangerous
18


conditions
in
their
home
countries;
and
19


WHEREAS,
TPS
recipients
have
filed
a
class-action
20


lawsuit,
which
has
blocked
the
termination
for
Sudan,
21


Nicaragua,
El
Salvador,
and
Haiti,
but
has
left
many
22


TPS
recipients
from
other
countries
in
a
state
of
fear
23


and
confusion;
and,
24


WHEREAS,
on
March
12,
2019,
Representative
Lucille
25


Roybal-Allard
introduced
the
American
Dream
and
26


Promise
Act
of
2019
in
the
United
States
House
of


27


Representatives,
which
would
provide
DACA
and
TPS
28


recipients,
along
with
other
immigrants
residing
in
the
29


United
States,
with
protection
from
deportation
and

opportunity
to
obtain
permanent
legal

in
the
1


United
States
if
they
meet
certain
requirements;
and
2


WHEREAS,
according
to
the
National
Immigration
3


Forum,
the
American
Dream
and
Promise
Act
would
allow
4


nearly
700,000
DACA
recipients,
as
well
as
another
5


1.6
million
eligible
immigrants
brought
to
America
as
6


children,
and
over
300,000
TPS
recipients,
to
stay
in
7


the
United
States;
NOW
THEREFORE,
8


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE

OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
That
9


the
House
of

respectfully
requests
that

FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
