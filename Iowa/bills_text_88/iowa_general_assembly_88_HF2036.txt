The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
relates
to
persons
eligible
to
obtain
a
3


professional
permit
to
carry
weapons.
4


Current
law
restricts
persons
eligible
to
obtain
a
5


professional
permit
to
carry
weapons
to
certain
individuals
6


involved
with
investigation,
security,
valuable
property
7


transportation,
corrections,
and
other
police
work
if
the
8


individual’s
occupation
reasonably
justifies
the
individual
9


going
armed.
The
bill
allows
an
emergency
medical
care
10


provider
to
obtain
a
professional
permit
to
carry
weapons
if
11


the
emergency
medical
care
provider
accompanies
police
tactical
12


teams
into
potentially
high
casualty
situations
in
which
a
13


threat
may
still
be
active.
Additionally,
the
emergency
14


medical
care
provider
shall
train
with
the
tactical
team,
15


complete
a
firearm
safety
training
course
that
qualifies
a
16


peace
officer
to
carry
a
firearm
in
the
normal
course
of
the
17


peace
officer’s
duties,
and
not
be
disqualified
from
obtaining
18


a
professional
or
nonprofessional
permit
to
carry
weapons.
19


Notwithstanding
a
general
prohibition,
the
bill
allows
an
20


employer
of
an
emergency
medical
care
provider
to
require
21


an
emergency
medical
care
provider
to
obtain
a
professional
22


permit
to
carry
weapons
as
a
condition
of
employment
if
the
23


emergency
medical
care
provider
accompanies
police
tactical
24


teams
consistent
with
the
bill.
25


By
operation
of
law,
a
professional
permit
to
carry
weapons
26


will
authorize
an
emergency
medical
care
provider
to
go
armed
27


anywhere
in
the
state
only
while
engaged
in
employment
and
28


while
going
to
and
from
the
place
of
employment.
An
emergency
29


medical
care
provider
shall
submit
an
application
and
undergo
30


a
criminal
history
background
check
prior
to
receiving
a
31


professional
permit
to
carry
weapons.
A
professional
permit
32


to
carry
weapons
issued
to
an
emergency
medical
care
provider
33


shall
expire
12
months
after
the
date
of
issue.
