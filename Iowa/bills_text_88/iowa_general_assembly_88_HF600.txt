Legislative
findings.
24


1.


The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
small
but
extremely
25


dangerous
group
of
sexually
violent
predators
exists
which
26


is
made
up
of
persons
who
do
not
have
a
mental
disease
or
27


defect
that
renders
them
appropriate
for
involuntary
treatment
28


pursuant
to
the
treatment
provisions
for
mentally
ill
persons
29


under
chapter
229
,
since
that
chapter
is
intended
to
provide
30


short-term
treatment
to
persons
with
serious
mental
disorders
31


and
then
return
them
to
the
community.
In
contrast
to
persons
32


appropriate
for
civil
commitment
under
chapter
229
,
sexually
33


violent
predators
generally
have
antisocial
personality
34


features
that
are
unamenable
to
existing
mental
illness

treatment
modalities
and
that
render
them
likely
to
engage
in
1


sexually
violent
behavior.
2


2.


The
general
assembly
finds
that
sexually
violent
3


predators’
likelihood
of
engaging
in
repeat
acts
of
predatory
4


sexual
violence
is
high
and
that
the
existing
involuntary
5


commitment
procedure
under
chapter
229
is
inadequate
to
address
6


the
risk
these
sexually
violent
predators
pose
to
society.
7


3.
The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
the
prognosis
8


for
rehabilitating
sexually
violent
predators
in
a
prison
9


setting
is
poor,
because
the
treatment
needs
of
this
population
10


are
very
long-term,
and
the
treatment
modalities
for
this
11


population
are
very
different
from
the
traditional
treatment
12


modalities
available
in
a
prison
setting
or
for
persons
13


appropriate
for
commitment
under
chapter
229
.
14


4.


Therefore,
the
general
assembly
finds
that
a
civil
15


commitment
procedure
for
the
long-term
care
and
treatment
of
16


the
sexually
violent
predator
is
necessary.
The
procedures
17


regarding
sexually
violent
predators
should
reflect
legitimate
18


public
safety
concerns,
while
providing
treatment
services
19


designed
to
benefit
sexually
violent
predators
who
are
civilly
20


committed.
The
procedures
should
also
reflect
the
need
to
21


protect
the
public,
to
respect
the
needs
of
the
victims
of
22


sexually
violent
offenses,
and
to
encourage
full,
meaningful
23


participation
of
sexually
violent
predators
in
treatment

programs.
