34

insurers
affiliated
with
a
mutual
insurance
holding
company

organized
pursuant
to
Code
section
521A.14,
and
including
those
3


insurers
which
confer
membership
rights
in
the
mutual

4


company.
A
dividing
insurer
is
defined
as
a
domestic
stock
5


insurer
that
approves
a
plan
of
division
(plan).
A
resulting
6


insurer
is
defined
as
a
dividing
insurer
that
survives
a
7


division,
or
a
new
domestic
stock
insurer
that
is
created
by
8


a
division.
9


The
bill
requires
a
dividing
insurer
to
develop
a
plan
that
10


identifies
the
dividing
insurer’s
name,
the
proposed
resulting
11


insurers
and
their
articles
of
incorporation
and
bylaws,
the
12


allocation
of
the
dividing
insurer’s
assets,
liabilities,
13


and
reinsurance
contracts
to
the
resulting
insurers,
and
the
14


manner
in
which
the
shares
in
the
resulting
insurers
will
be
15


distributed
to
the
dividing
insurer
or
its
shareholders.
16


If
the
dividing
insurer
will
survive
the
division,
the
plan
17


must
also
include
any
proposed
amendments
to
the
dividing
18


insurer’s
articles
of
incorporation
and
bylaws
and
the
manner
19


in
which
the
dividing
insurer
proposes
to
cancel
or
convert
20


some
of
its
shares.
If
the
dividing
insurer
will
not
survive
21


the
division,
the
plan
of
division
must
include
details
on
how
22


the
dividing
insurer
will
cancel
or
convert
its
shares.
23


The
bill
allows
a
dividing
insurer
to
amend
or
abandon
a
24


plan
under
certain
conditions
as
detailed
in
the
bill.
If
a
25


dividing
insurer
elects
to
abandon
the
dividing
insurer’s
plan
26


of
division,
the
dividing
insurer
is
required
to
notify
the
27


commissioner.


28


The
bill
requires
that
prior
to
filing
a
plan
with
the
29


commissioner,
a
dividing
insurer
must
obtain
approval
in
30


accordance
with
its
articles
of
incorporation
and
bylaws.
If
31


the
articles
of
incorporation
and
bylaws
do
not
provide
for
32


such
approval,
the
dividing
insurer
must
obtain
approval
in
33


accordance
with
all
provisions
of

The

not
jeopardize
the
financial
stability
of
a
dividing
insurer
17


or
the
resulting
insurers
or
prejudice
the
interests
of
the
18


policyholders
of
such
insurers;
that
all
resulting
insurers
19


created
by
the
proposed
division
are

and
eligible
to
20


receive
a
certificate
of
authority
to
transact
the

not
violate

creditors
25


of
the
dividing

all
resulting
insurers
will
be

transactions
in
which
such
resulting
insurer
has
been
engaged
29


in
or

The

that

the

A

the

insurer
files
16


the
certificate
with
the
secretary
of

The

survives,
the

provides

the
dividing
insurer
continues
21


to
exist
and
that
the
articles
of
incorporation
and
the
bylaws
22


of
the
dividing
insurer
must
be
amended
as

24


insurer’s
separate
existence
ceases
to
exist
and
any
resulting
25


insurers
created
by
the
plan
come
into
existence.
The

26


provides
that
all
resulting
insurers
hold
any
capital,
surplus,
27


and
other
assets
allocated
to
each
as
a
successor
to
the
28


dividing

All

30


that

All

33


other

3


A
resulting
insurer
to
which
a
cause
of
action
is
allocated
4


may
be
substituted
or
added
in
any
pending
action
to
which
5


the
dividing

when

effective.
All

8


insurer
to

only
for
9


those
liabilities,
including
policy
liabilities,
allocated
as
a
10


successor
to
the
dividing
insurer.
11


The
bill
also
provides
that
when
a
division
becomes
12


effective
any
shares
in
the
dividing
insurer
that
are
converted
13


or
canceled
entitle
the
shareholders
of
those
shares
to
14


the
rights
provided
under
the
plan
of
division
and
per
any
15


appraisal
rights
they
may
have
as
detailed
in
the
bill.
16


Unless
otherwise
provided
in
the
plan,
the
shares
and
17


securities
of
each
resulting
insurer
are
distributed
to
the
18


dividing
insurer
if
it
survives
the
division,
or
pro
rata
to
19


any
shareholders
of
the
dividing
insurer
that
do
not
assert
20


appraisal
rights.
21


The
bill
provides
that
after
a
division
becomes
effective,
22


each
resulting
insurer
is
individually
liable
for
all
23


liabilities
that
such
resulting
insurer
issues,
undertakes,
or
24


incurs
in
its
own
name;
each
resulting
insurer
is
individually
25


liable
for
the
liabilities
of
the
dividing
insurer
that
are
26


allocated
to
or
remain
the
liability
of
such
resulting
insurer
27


as
specified
in
the
plan;
and
the
dividing
insurer
remains
28


responsible
for
all
liabilities
of
the
dividing
insurer
that
29


are
not
allocated
by
the
plan
if
the
dividing
insurer
survives
30


the
division.
If
the
dividing
insurer
does
not
survive
the
31


division,
each
resulting
insurer
is
pro
rata
individually
32


liable
for
all
liabilities
of
the
dividing
insurer
that
are
not
33


allocated
by
the
plan.

breaches
a
contractual
obligation
of

dividing
insurer,
all
resulting
insurers
are
liable,
jointly
1


and
severally,
for
the
breach.
The
validity
and
effectiveness
2


of
the
division
are
not
affected
by
the
breach.
3


In
a
division,
a
direct
or
indirect
allocation
of
capital,
4


surplus,
assets,
or
liabilities,
including
policy
liabilities,
5


occurs
automatically
by
operation
of
law
and
is
not
treated
6


as
a
distribution
or
transfer
for
any
purpose
with
respect
to
7


either
the
dividing
insurer
or
any
of
the
resulting
insurers.
8


Except
as
provided
in
the
plan
and
as
approved
by
the
9


commissioner,
an
allocation
of
a
policy
or
other
liability
does
10


not
affect
the
rights
that
a
policyholder
or
creditor
has
under
11


any
other
law
with
respect
to
such
policy
or
other
liability,
12


except
that
such
rights
are
available
only
against
a
resulting
13


insurer
responsible
for
the
policy
or
liability.
A
reinsurer,
14


surety,
or
guarantor
of
the
policy
or
liability
is
not
released
15


from
their
obligations
under
the
policy
or
other
liability.
16


The
bill
allows
the
commissioner
to
adopt
rules
pursuant
17


to
Code

to
administer
the

of
the

and
allows

to
take
any
action
under
the
19


commissioner’s
authority
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
bill.

a
plan
of
21


division
to
the
definition
of
plan.

party,
if
the
