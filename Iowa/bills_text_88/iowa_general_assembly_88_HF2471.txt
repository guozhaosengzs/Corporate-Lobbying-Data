FINDINGS
——
FAMILIAL
RIGHTS.
15


1.
The
legislature
finds
that
the
familial
rights
and
16


the
liberty
of
families
of
origin
to
direct
the
upbringing,
17


education,
and
care
of
their
children
is
a
fundamental
right.
18


The
first
amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
19


guarantees
the
right
of
parents
and
children
to
have
and
20


maintain
intimate
and
expressive
close
family
relations
and
21


parent-child
freedom
of
speech,
association,
worship,
and
22


family
privacy,
the
regulation
of
which
shall
be
subject
to
23


strict
scrutiny,
and
the
state
shall
not
interfere
with
these
24


rights
except
upon
the
most
compelling
of
justifications
in
25


compliance
with
narrowly
tailored
laws
and
only
where
the
26


state
has
demonstrated
that
the
means
employed
are
the
least
27


restrictive
means
relating
to
the
rights
of
both
parents
and
28


children.
When
the
state
interferes
with
these
first
amendment
29


rights,
the
state
irreparably
harms
children.
30

The
familial
right
to
direct
education
includes
the
31


rights
of
parents
to
choose,
as
an
alternative
to
public

education,
private,
religious,
and
home
school
education.
A
33


parent
shall
have
the
right
to
make
reasonable
choices
for

their
child

This
chapter
shall
be
liberally
construed
to
the
end
19


that
each
child
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
shall
20


receive,
preferably
in
the
child’s
own
home,
the
care,

and
control
that
will
best
serve
the
child’s
welfare
and
the


22


best
interest
of
the

,
will
preserve
constitutionally

protected
rights,
and
will
protect
the
relationship
of
a
child
24


to
and
with
a
child’s
family
of
origin,
all
of
which
serve
25


the
interests
of
the
state
.
When
a
child
is
removed
from
the
26


control
of
the
child’s
parents,
the
court
shall
secure
for
27


the

care
as
nearly
as
possible
equivalent
to
that
which
28


should
have
been
given
by
the
parents.

Compelling
justification
is

for
the

to
interfere
in

to

a

that

shall
be

a
safe
and

If
a

is

a

of
the

welfare
checks
of
the


9


child’s
placement
with
a

other
than

10


shall
be

The
child
shall
only
be
removed
from
the

natural
parent’s

long
enough
to
ensure
that
any
imminently
12


dangerous
situation
is
addressed
and
care
has
been
taken
to
13


correct
the
imminent
danger.

A
state
agency
shall
not
require
any
natural
parent
to
15


admit
to
any
act
or
omission
as
a
condition
of
maintaining
an
16


association
with
and

of
their
child.
Matters
of

conscience,
differences

and
values
between


18


natural
parents
and
the
state
shall
not
be
used
as
evidence


19


against
a
natural
parent.
When
evaluating
the
severity
of
harm
20


to
a
child,
no
presumption
exists
that
a
child
placed
in
foster


21


care
will
not
suffer
any
harm.
The
state
shall
establish
22


evidence-based
balancing
metrics
of
risk
and
severity
based


23


on
the
abuse
children
receive
in
foster
care
and
the
harm
the
24


children
suffer
when
that
abuse
is
a

of
the
acts

of
a

are
not
bonded.
