_____


This
bill
relates
to
the
use
of
gasification
and
pyrolysis
1


facilities
for
the
conversion
of
certain
recoverable
waste
2


materials.
3


The
bill
creates
definitions
for
the
processes
of
4


gasification
and
pyrolysis,
the
facilities
where
those
5


processes
take
place
(“gasification
facility”
and
“pyrolysis
6


facility”),
and
the
materials
used
in
those
processes
7


(“post-use
polymer”
and
“recoverable
feedstock”).
The
8


bill
excludes
pyrolysis
and
gasification
facilities
from
9


the
definition
of
“sanitary
disposal
project”,
certain
10


post-use
polymers
and
recoverable
feedstocks
from
the
11


definition
of
“solid
waste”,
and
certain
gasification
and
12


pyrolysis
facilities
from
the
definition
of
“waste
conversion
13


technologies”.
As
such,
certain
post-use
polymers
and
14


recoverable
feedstocks
and
certain
gasification
and
pyrolysis
15


facilities
are
not
subject
to
solid
waste
procedures
and
16


requirements
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
455B.
