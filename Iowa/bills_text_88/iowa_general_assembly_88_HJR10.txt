HOUSE
JOINT
RESOLUTION


A
Joint
Resolution
requesting
the
calling
of
a
constitutional
1


convention
for
the
exclusive
purpose
of
proposing
an
2


amendment
to
the
United
States
Constitution
that
will
3


restore
balance
and
integrity
to
our
elections.
4


WHEREAS,
the
framers
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
5


States
of
America
intended
that
the
Congress
of
the
United
6


States
of
America
should
be
“dependent
on
the
people
alone”,
as
7


James
Madison
wrote
in
Federalist
number
52;
and
8


WHEREAS,
that
dependency
has
evolved
from
a
dependency
on
9


the
people
alone
to
a
dependency
on
powerful
special
interests,
10


through
campaigns
or
third-party
groups,
that
has
created
a
11


fundamental
imbalance
in
our
representative
democracy;
and
12


WHEREAS,
Americans
across
the
political
spectrum
agree
that
13


elections
in
the
United
States
of
America
should
be
free
from
14


the
disproportional
influence
of
special
interests
and
fair
15


enough
that
any
citizen
can
be
elected
into
office;
and
16


WHEREAS,
the
Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
states:
“All
17


political
power
is
inherent
in
the
people.
Government
is
18


instituted
for
the
protection,
security,
and
benefit
of
the
19


people,
and
they
have
the
right,
at
all
times,
to
alter
or
20


reform
the
same,
whenever
the
public
good
may
require
it.”;
and
21


WHEREAS,
Article
V
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
22


requires
Congress
to
call
a
convention
for
proposing
amendments
23


to
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
on
the
application
of
24


two-thirds
of
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states;
and
25


WHEREAS,
the
general
assembly
perceives
the
need
for
a
26


constitutional
convention
to
restore
balance
and
integrity
to
27


our
elections
by
proposing
an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
28


the
United
States
that
will
permanently
protect
free
and
fair
