Recognizing
that
the
goal
of
the
compact
is
to
14


pool
the
potential
savings
of
as
many
states
and
countries
as
15


possible
to
generate
sufficient
financial
incentives
to
develop
16


a
cure
for
many
of
the
world’s
most
devastating
diseases,
the
17


compact
will
respect
the
laws
of
each
of
these
United
States
by
18


adopting
rules
that
establish
ethical
standards
for
research
19


that
shall
be
followed
in
order
for
a
prize
to
be
claimed.
20


The
compact,
in
the
rules,
shall
establish
a
common
set
of
21


ethical
standards
that
embodies
the
laws
and
restrictions
in
22


each
of
the
states
so
that
to
be
eligible
for
claiming
a
prize,
23


the
entity
submitting
a
cure
must
not
have
violated
any
of
24


the
ethical
standards
in
any
one
of
the
fifty
states,
whether
25


the
states
have
joined
the
compact
or
not.
The

will

publish
these
common
ethical
standards
along
with
the
specific
27


criteria
for
a
cure
for
each
of
the
diseases
the
compact
has
28


targeted.

(2)
So
long
as
a
researcher
follows
the
common
ethical
30


standards
in
effect
at
the
time
the
research
is
done,
an
31


entity
presenting
a
cure
will
be
deemed
to
have
followed
the
32


standards.
On
or
before
January
1
of
each
year,
the
compact
33


shall
review
all
state
laws
to
determine
if
additional
