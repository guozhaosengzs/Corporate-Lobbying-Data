,
shall
not


be
required
to

more
than


from
solar
energy
facilities
located
in

this
state,
its
share
of
one
hundred
five
megawatts
of
power
20


from
alternate
energy
production
facilities
or
small
hydro


21


facilities
by
January
1,
2021,
and
two
thousand
five
hundred
22


megawatts
of
power
by
January
1,
2025,


at
the
rates
established
23


pursuant
to
section
476.43
.
The
board
shall
allocate
the
one
24


hundred
five
megawatts
solar
energy
ownership
or
purchase
25


requirements
based
upon
each
utility’s
percentage
of
the
total
26


Iowa
retail
peak
demand,
for
the
year
beginning
January
1,
27

,
29


the
board
shall
combine
the
allocated
purchases
of
power


solar
30


energy
for
each
utility
involved
in
the
reorganization.
31


(2)


In
satisfying
the
solar
energy
ownership
or
purchase
32


requirements
pursuant

a
minimum
of
ten
33


percent
of

b.
Notwithstanding
the
one
hundred
five
megawatt
maximum


2


solar
energy
ownership
or
purchase
requirements
established
3


in
paragraph
“a”
,
the
board
may
increase
the
amount
of
power
4


solar
energy


that
a
utility
is
required
to
own
or
purchase
at
5


the
rates
established
pursuant
to
section
476.43
if
the

that
a
utility,
including
a
reorganized
utility,
exceeds
7


its
1990


2019
Iowa
retail
peak
demand
by
twenty
percent
and
8


the
additional
power


solar
energy
the
utility
is
required
to
9


purchase
will
encourage
the
development
of
alternate
energy
10


production
facilities
and
small
hydro


solar
energy
facilities.
11


The
increase
shall
not
exceed
the
utility’s
increase
in
peak
12


demand
multiplied
by
the
ratio
of
the
utility’s
share
of
the
13


one
hundred
five
megawatt
maximum


solar
energy
ownership
or
14


purchase
requirements
to
its
1990
2019

the
explanation’s
substance
by

members
of
the
general
assembly.
18


This
bill
provides
for
solar
energy
storage
capacity
19


and
specifies
certain
solar
energy
ownership
or

21


The
bill
allows
a
rate-regulated
electric
utility
to
provide
22


for
solar
energy
storage
capacity
paired
with
solar
energy
23


facility
installations
in
Iowa.
Storage
capacity
based
on
24


electrical
output
may
be
credited
to
the
utility’s
solar
energy
25


ownership
or
purchase
requirements
as
provided
in
the
bill.
26


The
Iowa
economic
development
authority
shall
define
by

meaning
of
the
term
“storage”,
consistent
with
the
Iowa
28


energy
plan
adopted
by
the
authority.
29


Current
law
requires
electric
utilities
to
own
alternate
30


energy
production
facilities
or
small
hydro
facilities
located
31


in
Iowa,
or
to
enter
into
long-term
contracts
to
purchase
32


electricity

The
bill
modifies
the
alternate
energy
ownership
or

1


requirement
to
make
it
applicable
strictly
to
solar
energy

derived
from
solar
energy
facilities
located

Iowa,
and
3


requires
an
electric
utility
to
own
or
purchase
its
share
of
4


105
megawatts

1,
2021,
and
2,500
megawatts

Of
these
amounts,
a
minimum
of
6


10
percent
of
the
energy
produced
or
