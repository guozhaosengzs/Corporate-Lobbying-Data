BILL’S
PROVISIONS.
This

requires
the
owner
or

17


of
a

feeding
operation
to
notify
the
department
of
18


natural
resources
(DNR)
of
any
actual
or
probable
immediate
19


structural
failure
from
an
associated
manure
storage
structure
20


(structure).
The
failure
may
be
the
result
of
either
the
21


design
or
construction
of
the
structure.
The
determination
22


of
a
probable
immediate
structural
failure
must
be
based
on
23


factors
established
by
DNR
which
may
include
an
observation
by
24


the
owner
or
operator
or
a
report
submitted
to
the
owner
or
25


operator
by
a
professional
engineer.
DNR
is
required
to
adopt
26


rules
that
provide
for
notice
procedures
which
may
take
into
27


account
factors
that
quantify
the
level
of
threat
to
water
28


quality
resulting
from
a
discharge
or
an
injury
to
or
death
of
29


an

BACKGROUND.
The
bill
amends
provisions
in
Code
chapter
459
31


(“Animal
Agriculture
Compliance
Act”)
which
in
part
regulates
32


confinement
feeding
operations;
meaning
any
area
where
certain
33


agricultural
animals
are
confined
to
totally
roofed
areas
34


(most
commonly
buildings),
if
fed
and
maintained
for
45

days
or
more
in
any
12-month
period,
and
includes
associated
1


manure
storage
structures.
Code
chapter
459,
subchapter
III,
2


regulates
water
quality,
and
includes
requirements
for
the
3


construction
of
a
number
of
types
of
manure
storage
structures,
4


including
those
made
of
durable
materials
such
as
concrete
5


and
steel
(formed)
and
an
impoundment
including
an
anaerobic
6


lagoon,
aerobic
structure,
or
earthen
manure
storage
basin
7


(unformed).
Generally,
a
manure
storage
structure
must
be
8


constructed
pursuant
to
design
standards
established
by
DNR
9


rule
(Code
sections
459.307
and
459.308,
and
567
IAC
ch.
65).
10


A
confinement
feeding
operation
structure
is
required
to
retain
11


all
manure
produced
between
periods
of
manure
disposal
(Code
12


section
459.311)
and
is
prohibited
from
discharging
manure
into
13


waters
of
the
state
which
includes
surface
waters
or
ground
14


water
sources.
15


PENALTIES
APPLICABLE.
A
person
who
violates
Code
chapter
16


459,
subchapter
III,
regulating
water
quality,
is
subject
17


to
judicial
action
brought
by
the
attorney
general
with
18


a
civil
penalty
not
to
exceed
$5,000
for
each
day
of
such
19


violation
(Code
sections
455B.191
and
459.603).
However,
20


DNR
is
authorized
to
impose
a
range
of
civil
penalties
21


administratively
based
on
a
number
of
criteria
and
in
that
case
22


the
civil
penalty
cannot
exceed
$10,000
(Code
sections
455B.109
23


and
459.603).
24


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill,
if
enacted,
would
take
effect
upon
25


enactment.
