EXPLANATION
21


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
22


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
23


This
bill
amends
the
Iowa
criminal
code
to
provide
for
24


punishment
by
death
for
capital
murder
committed
by
a
person
25


age
18
or
older
if
the
trial
jury,
or
the
judge
if
there
26


is
no
jury,
makes
specific
findings
and
whether
the
jury
27


believes
the
defendant
should
be
put
to
death
in
a
separate
28


penalty
proceeding
held
after
the
close
of
the
initial
trial
29


proceeding.
Under
the
bill,
a
death
sentence
could
be
imposed
30


if
the
murder
would
constitute
murder
in
the
first
degree.
31


The
bill
provides
that
in
order
to
receive
a
sentence
of
32


death,
the
defendant
must
be
at
least
18
years
of
age
at
the
33


time
the
murder
in
the
first
degree
was
committed,
must
not
be
34


mentally
ill
or
intellectually
disabled,
and
must

major
participant
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
must
have
1


shown
a
manifest
indifference
to
human
life.
2


The
bill
specifies
that
the
attorney
general
may
prosecute
3


all
actions
and
proceedings
involving
capital
murder,
when
4


in
the
attorney
general’s
judgment
the
interest
of
the
state
5


requires
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
6


county
attorney,
or
upon
request
by
the
county
attorney.
7


If
a
person
is
indigent
and
is
charged
with
capital
murder,
8


payment
of
costs
for
two
attorneys
is
authorized.
The
supreme
9


court
is
required
to
establish
standards
for
the
competency
of
10


counsel
in
death
penalty
cases.
The
state
public
defender
is
11


charged
with
establishing
teams
of
qualified
lead
and
cocounsel
12


for
death
penalty
cases,
as
well
as
conducting
or
sponsoring
13


specialized
training
programs
for
attorneys
representing
14


persons
who
may
be
executed.
15


If
a
capital
murder
case
proceeds
to
trial
and
a
notice
of
16


intent
to
seek
the
death
penalty
has
been
filed,
in
addition
to
17


any
other
defenses
which
may
be
presented
to
the
charge,
the
18


defendant
may
raise
the
issue
of
intellectual
disability
or
19


mental
illness
during
the
time
of
filing
pretrial
motions.
20


Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
21


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
22


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the
23


race,
color,
religious
beliefs,
national
origin,
sex,
or
other
24


protected
classes
under
Code
chapter
216
of
the
defendant
or
25


of
any
victim
is
not
to
be
considered.
The
supreme
court
26


shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
death
sentences
27


imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
imposed
under
the
28


influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
available
to
29


litigants.
30


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
31


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
32


a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
33


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
34


a
reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances

that
may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
1


sentenced
to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
2


consider
include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
3


influence
of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
4


age
of
the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
5


the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
6


not
to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
7


no
significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
8


under
extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
9


the
murder;
and
the
defendant’s
character
or
record
or
the
10


circumstances
of
the
offense.
The
sentencing
proceeding
is
11


conducted
separately
from
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
12


the
same
trier
of
fact.
13


For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
14


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
15


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
16


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
17


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
18


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.
Evidence
of
certain
19


juvenile
delinquency
adjudications
is
not
admissible
in
any
20


proceeding
to
determine
the
sentence.
If
the
jury
fails
to
21


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
22


penalty
imposed
would
be
life
imprisonment.
23


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
24


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
25


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
26


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
27


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
28


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
29


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
30


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the
supreme
31


court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
32


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
33


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
34


witnessing
of
executions.

A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
1


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
2


the

is
no

A

is
also
provided
3


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane
4


after
conviction
but
before

5


An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or
6


assist
in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be

8


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
9


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
10


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
11


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
12


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or

Therefore,
13


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
14


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
15


The
bill
contains
severability
provisions
and
takes
effect
16


January
1,
2020,
and
applies
only
to
offenses
committed
