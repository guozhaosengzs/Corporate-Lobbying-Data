EXPLANATION
6


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
7


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
8


Current
law
requires
proof
of
motor
vehicle
financial
9


responsibility
to
cover
liability
for
damages
arising
out
of
10


the
ownership,
maintenance,
or
use
of
a
motor
vehicle
in
the
11


amounts
of
$20,000
because
of
bodily
injury
to
or
death
of
one
12


person
in
any
one
accident,
and,
subject
to
the
limit
for
one
13


person,
$40,000
because
of
bodily
injury
to
or
death
of
two
or
14


more
persons
in
any
one
accident,
and
$15,000
because
of
injury
15


to
or
destruction
of
property
of
others
in
any
one
accident.
16


This
bill
increases
the
required
amounts
for

17


occurring

2020,
to
$40,000

two
or
more
persons

any
one
21

and
$30,000
because
of
injury
to
or
destruction
of
22


property
of
others
in
any
one
accident.
23


The
bill
strikes
similar
provisions
in
Code
section
321A.5
24


(security
required
following
accident)
and
Code
section
321A.21
25


(“motor
vehicle
liability
policy”
defined),
and
adds
references
26


to
the
amounts
specified
in
Code
section
321A.1.
The
bill
27


makes
a
corresponding
reference
change
in
the
definition
of
28


“financial
liability
coverage”
under
Code
section
321.1.
29


By
operation
of
law,
the
amounts
required
for
a
surety
bond
30


under
Code
section
321A.24
(bond
as
proof)
and
for
uninsured,
31


underinsured,
and
hit-and-run
coverage
under
Code
chapter
516A
32


(uninsured,
underinsured,
or
hit-and-run
motorists)
are
also
33


increased
by
the
bill.
