20


This
bill
relates
to
a
defendant
filing
an
application
for
21


an
order
to
require
that
DNA
analysis
be
performed
on
evidence
22


after
conviction.
23


The
bill
modifies
or
adds
numerous
definitions
under
Code
24


chapter
81
(DNA
profiling).
25


The
bill
defines
“national
DNA
index
system”
to
mean
a
26


national,
searchable
DNA
database
created
and
maintained
by
the
27


federal
bureau
of
investigation
where
DNA
profiles
are
stored
28


and
searched
at
a
local,
state,
or
national
level.
29


The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
“DNA
profile”
to
include
30


the
objective
form
of
the
results
of
DNA
analysis
performed
on
31


a
forensic
sample
or
an
individual’s
DNA
sample.
Currently,
32


“DNA
profile”
means
the
objective
form
of
the
results
of
DNA
33


analysis
performed
on
a
DNA
sample,
and
the
results
of
all
DNA
34


identification
analysis
on
an
individual’s
DNA
sample
are
also

collectively
referred
to
as
the
DNA
profile
of
an
individual.
1


The
bill
defines
“forensic
sample”
to
mean
an
evidentiary
2


item
that
potentially
contains
DNA
relevant
to
a
crime.
3


The
bill
defines
“keyboard
search”
to
mean
a
keyboard
4


search
as
defined
in
the
national
DNA
index
system
operational
5


procedures
manual.
6


The
bill
defines
“state
DNA
index
system”
to
mean
a
7


state
searchable
DNA
database
created
and
maintained
by
the
8


department
of
public
safety
where
DNA
profiles
are
stored
and
9


searched
at
the
state
level.
10


The
bill
provides
that
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
of
11


a
felony
or
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
may
make
an
application
12


to
the
court
for
an
order
to
require
that
DNA
profiling
be
13


performed
on
a
forensic
sample
collected
in
the
case
for
which
14


the
defendant
stands
convicted.
Current
law
provides
that
such
15


a
defendant
who
has
not
previously
been
required
to
submit
a
16


DNA
sample
for
DNA
profiling
may
make
such
an
application.
17


The
bill
requires
the
defendant’s
application
for
an
order
18


to
require
DNA
profiling
be
performed
on
a
forensic
sample
19


collected
in
the
case
to
include
a
statement
detailing
why
20


the
DNA
profiling
results
would
have
changed
the
outcome
of
21


the
trial
or
invalidated
a
guilty
plea
if
the
requested
DNA
22


profiling
had
been
conducted
prior
to
the
conviction.
Current
23


law
requires
such
application
to
state
why
DNA
evidence
would
24


have
changed
the
outcome
of
the
trial
or
invalidated
a
guilty
25


plea
if
DNA
profiling
had
been
conducted
prior
to
conviction.
26


The
bill
specifies
that
the
defendant’s
application
shall
27


be
served
upon
the
county
attorney
and
upon
the
laboratory,
if
28


known
by
the
defendant,
holding
the
biological
evidence.
29


Subject
to
the
confidentiality
provisions
of
Code
section
30


81.8,
the
bill
requires
that
any
DNA
profiling
of
the
defendant
31


or
an
unknown
person,
or
other
biological
evidence
conducted
32


by
the
state
or
by
the
defendant
shall
be
disclosed
and
the
33


results
of
such
profiling
or
other
testing
be
described
in
34


the
motion
or
answer.
Current
law
requires
DNA
profiling,
35

not
DNA
testing
results,
to
be
disclosed
and
does
not
require
1


disclosure
when
the
DNA
profiling
results
in
the
DNA
profile
of
2


an
unknown
person.
3


The
bill
specifies
that
the
court
shall
grant
the
4


defendant’s
application
for
an
order
to
require
that
DNA
5


profiling
be
performed
on
a
forensic
sample
collected
in
the
6


case
for
which
the
person
stands
convicted
when
either
DNA
7


profiling
has
not
been
performed
on
the
forensic
sample
or
when
8


DNA
profiling
has
been
previously
performed
on
the
forensic
9


sample
and
the
defendant
is
requesting
DNA
profiling
using
a
10


new
method
or
technology
that
is
substantially
more
probative
11


than
the
DNA
profiling
previously
performed.
12


Additionally,
the
bill
specifies
that
the
defendant’s
13


application
shall
be
granted
if
a
sufficient
chain
of
custody
14


has
been
established
for
the
forensic
sample;
the
identity
of
15


the
person
who
committed
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
16


was
convicted
was
a
significant
issue
in
the
crime
for
which
17


the
defendant
was
convicted;
the
forensic
sample
is
material
18


to
evidence
included
in
the
trial
record
or
admitted
to
at
a
19


guilty
plea
proceeding;
and
the
DNA
profiling
results
would
20


raise
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
defendant
would
not
21


have
been
convicted
if
such
results
had
been
introduced
at
22


trial.
23


Upon
the
court
granting
a
defendant’s
application
under
the
24


bill,
DNA
profiling
of
a
forensic
sample
shall
be
conducted
25


within
the
guidelines
generally
accepted
by
the
scientific
26


community
if
the
testing
type
or
resulting
profile
is
not
27


eligible
to
be
uploaded
or
searched
in
the
national
DNA
index
28


system
database.
If
court-ordered
DNA
profiling
produces
an
29


unidentified
DNA
profile,
after
notice
to
the
parties,
the
30


court
may
order
the
department
of
public
safety
to
either:
(1)
31


compare
the
DNA
profile
to
the
national
DNA
index
system
if
the
32


combined
DNA
index
system
administrator
determines
that
the
33


forensic
sample
is
collected
contemporaneously
from
the
crime
34


scene,
has
a
nexus
to
the
crime
scene,
is
probative,
and
is

the

was
generated
through
a
1


technology
that
complies
with
all
requirements
in
the
national

and
the

profile
to
the
state
DNA

system
if
the

8


The
bill
provides
that
if
any
provision
of
the
court
order
9


results
in
a
violation
of
federal
law,
the
federal
bureau
10


of

for
participation
in
the
national
DNA
index
system,
15


that
portion
of
the
order
shall
be
considered
unenforceable.
16


The
bill
provides
that
the
results
of
DNA
profiling
shall
17


be
provided
to
the
court,
the
defendant,
the
state,
and
18


the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
DNA
samples
obtained
19


pursuant
to
the
bill
may
be
included
in
the
DNA
data
bank,
20


and
DNA
profiles
and
DNA
records
may
be
included
in
the
21


DNA
database.
A
criminal
or
juvenile
justice
agency
shall
22


maintain
DNA
samples
and
forensic
samples
that
could
be
tested
23


for
DNA
for
a
period
of
three
years
beyond
the
limitations
24


for
the
commencement
of
criminal
actions
under
Code
chapter
25


802.
Failure
to
maintain
DNA
samples
and
forensic
samples
as
26


specified
in
the
bill
does
not
create
a
cause
of
action
for
27


damages
or
a
presumption
of
spoliation
in
the
event
a
forensic
28


sample
is
no

29


If
the
court
determines
a
defendant
who
files

The

The

provides
that
a
