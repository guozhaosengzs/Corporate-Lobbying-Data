low-income

and
poverty
weighting
work

Section
1.
POVERTY
WEIGHTING
WORK
GROUP.
1


1.
School
funding
has
grown
increasingly
inequitable
as
2


it
relates
to
supporting
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
3


students.
In
order
to
meet
the
needs
of
such
students
and
4


to
ensure
access
to
the
same
opportunities
that
economically
5


advantaged
school
districts
offer,
school
districts
with
higher
6


percentages
of
students
in
poverty
spend
more
per
pupil
to
7


cover
the
cost
of
the
students’
increased
needs
as
compared
8


to
economically
advantaged
school
districts.
Children
from
9


economically
disadvantaged
homes
often
enter
school
with
a
10


more
limited
vocabulary
and
fewer
educational
life
experiences
11


than
those
from
economically
advantaged
homes.
According
12


to
the
child
and
family
policy
center,
children
living
in
13


poverty
are
more
likely
than
their
peers
to
experience
stress
14


and
deprivation
that
hinders
development
and
readiness
for
15


school
and
life.
Significant
levels
of
poverty
exist
in
16


all
ninety-nine
counties
of
this
state
and,
therefore,
the
17


general
assembly
should
consider
additional
ways
to
close
the
18


opportunity
gap
within
the
funding
formula.
19


2.
According
to
the
2018
condition
of
education
annual
20


report,
forty
and
one-half
percent
of
Iowa
students
are
21


eligible
for
free
and
reduced
price
meals
under
the
federal
22


National
School
Lunch
Act
and
the
federal
Child
Nutrition
Act
23


of
1966,
42
U.S.C.
§1751-1785,
the
most
widely
used
measure
24


of
student
poverty,
including
within
Iowa’s
methodology
for
25


funding
at-risk
and
dropout
prevention
programs.
26


3.
The
school
finance
formula
review
committee
established


27


under
section
257.1,
subsection
4,
met
on
December
13,
2019,
28


and
recommended
to
the
general
assembly
the
creation
of
a
29


poverty
weighting
study
committee.
30


4.
The
director
of
the
department
of
education
shall
31


establish
and
appoint

levels
of
