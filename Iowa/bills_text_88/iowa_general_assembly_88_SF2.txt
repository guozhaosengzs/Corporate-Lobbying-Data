The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute

with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members

the

17


This
bill
amends
Code
section

to
require
the

18


of
a
vehicle
overtaking
a
person
riding
a

proceeding

side
of
the

until

23


bicycle
in

25


the

unreasonably

riding
26


a

This

apply
if
the

is
traveling
on
a

or

and
a

causes
a
serious
injury,
a
33


court
could
impose
an

for
not
more
than

Under
Code
section
321.234,
a
person
riding
a
bicycle
on
the
4


highway
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
Code
chapter
321
(motor
5


vehicles
and
law
of
the
road)
and
has
all
the
rights
and
duties
6


applicable
to
the
driver
of
a
vehicle.
The
bill
specifies
7


that
under
Code
section
321.304
a
vehicle
is
prohibited
from
8


overtaking
and
passing
a
bicycle
when
approaching
the
crest
of
9


a
grade
or
upon
a
curve
in
the
highway
where
the
driver’s
view
10


along
the
highway
is
obstructed
for
a
distance
of
approximately
11


700
feet;
when
approaching
within
100
feet
of
any
narrow
12


bridge,
viaduct,
or
tunnel;
or
when
approaching
within
100
feet
13


of
or
traversing
any
intersection
or
railroad
grade
crossing.
14


However,
the
bill
provides
that
a
vehicle
may
pass
a
bicycle
15


where
official
signs
are
in
place
directing
that
traffic
keep
16


to
the
right
or
a
distinctive
center
line
or
off-center
line
17


is
marked,
provided
the
vehicle
complies
with
the
current
18


requirements
for
overtaking
on
the
left.
19


A
violation
of
Code
section
321.304
is
punishable
by
a
20


scheduled
fine
of
$100.
However,
if
the
violation
causes
a
21


serious
injury,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
22


and
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
23


days.
If
the
violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
24


an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
and
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
25


license
for
not
more
than
180
days.
26


Current
law
requires
a
bicycle
to
have
a
front
lighted
27


lamp
and
either
a
rear
lighted
lamp
or
a
rear
reflector
at
28


any
time
from
sunset
to
sunrise,
and
at
such
other
times
29


when
conditions
such
as
fog,
snow,
sleet,
or
rain
provide
30


insufficient
lighting
to
render
clearly
discernible
persons
and
31


vehicles
on
the
highway
at
a
distance
of
500
feet
ahead.
The
32


bill
instead
requires
that,
from
sunset
to
sunrise,
a
bicycle
33


must
be
equipped
with
a
lamp
on
the

exhibiting
a

3


The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
of
this
provision
is
$25.
4


However,
the
bill
provides
that
a
citation
issued
for
failure
5


to
have
a
front
or
rear
lamp
on
a
bicycle
or
on
a
bicycle
rider
6


must
first
provide
for
a
72-hour
period
within
which
the
person
7


charged
with
the

can

If
8


the
person
complies
with
the
directive
to
replace
or
repair
the
9


bicycle
lamp,
the
citation
must
be
expunged.

The

requires

riding
a
bicycle
on
a

11


with
a
speed
limit
of

at
