RETROACTIVE
APPLICABILITY.
The
following
applies
2


retroactively
to
January
1,
2019,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
3


after
that

for

made

of
principal

or

on
a

subsection

EXPLANATION
8


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
9


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
10


This
bill
changes
the
effective
date
for
a
new
deduction
11


for
any
income
of
an
employee
resulting
from
the
payment
by
12


an
employer,
whether
paid
to
the
employee
or
a
lender,
of
13


principal
or
interest
on
the
employee’s
qualified
education
14


loan.
Currently,
the
new
deduction
is
set
to
begin
in
tax
year
15


2023
or
in
a
later
tax
year,
contingent
upon
the
satisfaction
16


of
certain
net
general
fund
revenue
amount
and
growth
targets.
17


The
bill
moves
up
the
effective
date
for
this
new
deduction
18


to
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2019.
In
order
19


to
move
up
the
effective
date
for
the
new
deduction,
the
bill
20


strikes
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161,
section
112.
However,
21


there
is
an
unrelated
provision
to
the
new
deduction
in
2018
22


Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161,
section
112,
thus
the
bill
reinserts
23


the
unrelated
provision
in
order
to
preserve
this
provision.
24


Federal
income
tax
law
does
provide
a
limited
deduction
for
25


a
taxpayer’s
payment
of
interest
on
qualified
education
loans,
26


and
the
bill
disallows
the
new
Iowa
deduction
for
any
amount
27


of
income
that
represents
an
interest
payment
that
was
also
28


deducted
by
the
employee
in
computing
federal
taxable
income.
29


The
bill
defines
“qualified
education
loan”
to
mean
the
same
30


as
defined
in
section
221
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
