the
state
20

Article
3
——
Findings.
The
member
states
find
all
of
the
33


following:
34


a.
Corporate
welfare
as
an
economic
development
policy
is
35


-1-

H.F.
2095


among
the
least
effective
uses
of
taxpayer
dollars.
1


b.
Local
and
state
leaders
are
in
a
prisoner’s
dilemma
2


where
it
is
in
all
member
states’
interest
to
stop
corporate
3


welfare
altogether
and
to
create
a
level
playing
field
for
4


all
employers;
however,
each
level
of
government
has
the
5


incentive
to
subsidize
companies
through
corporate
welfare
6


which
generates
a
race
to
the
bottom.
7


c.
Member
states’
cooperation
to
phase
out
all
forms
of
8


corporate
welfare,
both
company-specific
and
industry-specific,
9


is
required
to
free
government
leaders
from
the
prisoner’s
10


dilemma.
11


d.
While
it
will
take
years
to
build
a
national
consensus
to
12


phase
out
all
forms
of
corporate
welfare,
member
states
must
13


begin
to
phase
out
the
most
egregious
and
destructive
forms
of
14


corporate
welfare
as
soon
as
practical
where
member
states
can
15


reach
an
agreement
to
do
so.
16


e.
Companies
should
grow
and
potentially
relocate
to
other
17


states
based
on
the
general
condition
of
the
state,
including
18


but
not
limited
to
more
modern
infrastructure,
an
educated
19


workforce,
a
clean
environment,
and
a
favorable
tax
and
20


regulatory
climate,
and
not
based
on
corporate
welfare.
21


f.
Company-specific
tax
incentives
and
company-specific
22


grants
fuel
business
inequality
as
only
the
largest
businesses
23


tend
to
receive
the
company-specific
tax
incentives
and
24


company-specific
grants.
25


g.
A
national
board
of
appointees
from
member
states
is
26


created
to
come
to
a
consensus
and
to
draft
improvements
to
27


this
compact.
28


h.
This
compact
shall
utilize
a
collaborative
approach
29


to
build
a
national
consensus
for
a
better,
fairer
economic


30


development
policy
for
all
member
states.

welfare

companies
in
32


other
member
states.
