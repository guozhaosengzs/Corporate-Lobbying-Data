Medicaid
services
of
the
United
States
department
of

and

human

for
a
section
1115
demonstration
waiver
to
allow
2


for
the
payment
of
the
nursing
facility
room
and
board
expenses
3


for
a
dually
eligible
Medicare
and
Medicaid
member
receiving
4


the
Medicare
hospice
benefit
or
a
Medicaid-only
member
electing
5


the
member’s
hospice
benefit,
to
allow
Medicaid
managed
care
6


organizations
(MCOs)
and
the
Medicaid
fee-for-service
(FFS)
7


payment
system
to
reimburse
the

for

the
room
and

expenses
at
no
less
than
95

of

nursing
facility’s
Medicaid
FFS
rate
rather
than
indirectly
10


as
a
pass-through
payment
from
the
hospice
services
provider.
11


The
bill
requires
DHS
to
report
receipt
of
such
approval
to
12


the
chairpersons
and
ranking
members
of
the
appropriations
13


committees
of
the
house
and
senate,
the
co-chairpersons
and
14


ranking
members
of
the
joint
appropriations
subcommittee
15


on
health
and
human
services,
and
the
legislative
services
16


agency.
The
bill
requires
DHS
to
adopt
administrative
rules
17


to
administer
the
bill
and
specifically
to
allow
Medicaid
MCOs
18


and
the
department’s
FFS
Medicaid
payment
system
to
reimburse
a
19


nursing
facility
directly
for
the
room
and
board
expenses
at
20


no
less
than
95
percent
of
the
nursing
facility’s
Medicaid
FFS
21


rate
as
provided
in
the
bill.
22


Currently,
the
Medicare
hospice
benefit
covers
the
costs
of
23


palliative
care
for
an
individual
who
is
terminally
ill
in
the
24


individual’s
home
or
in
a
nursing
facility.
Medicare
does
not
25


have
a
long-term
custodial
nursing
facility
benefit,
so
if
an
26


individual
elects
the
Medicare
hospice
benefit
in
a
nursing
27


facility,
the
individual’s
room
and
board
are
not
covered
by
28


Medicare
and
the
individual
or
a
third-party
payor
must
pay
for
29


the
costs
of
the
room
and
board.
For
those
individuals
dually
30


eligible
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
who
elect
the
Medicare
31


hospice
benefit,
Medicare
is
financially
responsible
for
the
32


hospice
care
and
the
Medicaid
program
is
the
third-party
payor
33


responsible
for
the
nursing
facility
room
and
board
expense.
34


For
the
nursing
facility
room
and
board
care,
the
Medicaid
35

program
must
provide
for
payment
in
an
amount
equal
to
at
least
1


95
percent
of
the
Medicaid
daily
nursing
facility
base
rate
2


(the
rate
the
state
Medicaid
program
pays
for
nursing
facility
3


services
furnished
to
an
individual
who
has
not
elected
to
4


receive
hospice
care).
Historically,
the
Medicaid
program
5


has
paid
the
hospice
provider
for
the
nursing
facility
room
6


and
board
expenses
of
dually
eligible
individuals
who
elect
7


the
hospice
benefit,
and
the
hospice
provider
has
then
passed
8


this
payment
on
to
the
nursing
facility
under
a
contract
with
9


the
nursing
facility.
Current
practice
is
for
most
hospice
10


providers
to
pay
100
percent
of
the
nursing
facility
base
rate
11


to
the
nursing
facility.
12


Pursuant
to
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1038,
DHS
was
directed
to
13


review
the
hospice
benefit
for
dually
eligible
individuals
in
14


a
nursing
facility
and
report
options
for
elimination
of
the
15


pass-through
payments
to
the
chairperson
and
ranking
members
16


of
the
joint
appropriations
subcommittee
on
health
and
human
17


services,
the
legislative
service
agency,
and
the
legislative
18


caucus
staffs
on
or
before
October
1,
2018.
DHS
submitted
19


the
report
that
included
four
options.
The
bill
reflects
20


option
1
of
the
report
which
is
budget
neutral
with
regard
to
21


the
dually
eligible
members
and
would
require
DHS
to
request
22


federal
approval
to
allow
Medicaid
managed
care
organizations
23


and
the
Medicaid
fee-for-service
payment
system
to
pay
the
24


nursing
facility
directly
for
the
nursing
facility
room
and
25


board
costs,
and
eliminate
the
pass-through
payment
utilizing
26


the
hospice
provider.
