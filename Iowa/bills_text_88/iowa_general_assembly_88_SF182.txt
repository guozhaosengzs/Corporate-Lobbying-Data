This
bill
relates
to

taxes
by
repealing
the
individual
1


income
tax
and
increasing
the
state
sales
and
use
tax
rates.
2


Division
I
repeals
the
individual
income
tax
and
makes
3


numerous
conforming
changes
to
the
Code
to
remove
references
4


to
the
individual
income
tax
and
to
update
or
move
provisions
5


of
the
individual
income
tax
that
are
also
applicable
by
6


reference
to
the
corporate
income
tax
and
the
franchise
tax.
7


The
division
also
repeals

9


surtax
in

section
257.29,
and
the
physical
plant
11


and
equipment
income
surtax
in
Code
section
298.2,
because

13


state
individual
income
tax.
14


The
repeal

training
program
in
Code
chapter
260E,
the

accelerated

Code
chapter
260G,
and
17


the
targeted
jobs
withholding
credit
in
Code
section
403.19A,
18


because
those
programs
rely
on
income
tax
amounts
withheld
from
19


employee
wages
by
employers.
20


The
division
provides
that
additional
