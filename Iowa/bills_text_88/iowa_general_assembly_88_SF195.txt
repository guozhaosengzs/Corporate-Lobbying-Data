The

or
on
the
first
date
that
an

takes
6


either
family
leave
or
medical
leave.
The
minimum
duration
of
7


leave
an
eligible
employee
may
take
is
eight
consecutive
hours.
8


An
employee
is
disqualified
for
family
leave
and
medical
9


leave
benefits
for
an
absence
due
to
the
employee
purposefully
10


causing
injury

sickness
to
the
employee
or
a
family
member,
11


for
an
absence
caused
by
an
illness
or
injury
due
to
the
12


employee
engaging
in
an
illegal
act,
or
an
absence
due
to
an
13


employer
taking
disciplinary
action
against
the
employee.
14


An
employee
must
provide
a
minimum
of
30
days
notice
to
an
15


employer
of
the
employee’s
intent
to
take
leave
for
the
birth
16


of
a
child
or

of
a

for
adoption
or
foster
care,
17


or
of
the
employee’s
intent
to
take
family
leave
or
medical
18


leave.
If
circumstances
require
an
employee’s
leave
to
begin
19


in
less
than
30
days,
the
employee
must
give
as
much
notice
as
20


is
practicable.
If
an
eligible
employee
requests
medical
leave
21


or
family
leave,
the
employee
must
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
22


schedule
their
own,
or
their
family
member’s
medical
treatment,
23


to
not
unduly
disrupt
the
employer’s
operations.
24


The
bill
requires
an
eligible
employee
to
file
a
claim
25


for
benefits
as
required
by
the
director.
The
employee
26


must
consent
to
the
disclosure
of
potentially
private
or
27


confidential
information
to
and
from
the
department,
and
the
28


employee’s
employer,
for
administration
of
the
family
leave
29


or
medical
leave.
The
bill
specifies
that
such
information
30


is
not
a
public
record
pursuant
to
Code
section
22.1.
The
31


employee
must
attest
that
the
employee
has
provided
notice
of
32


the
employee’s
intent
to
take
leave
to
the
employee’s
employer.
33


The
employee
must
also
authorize
the

the
statewide
average
12


weekly
wage
paid
to
employees
as
determined
by
the
department
13


of
workforce
development.
The
minimum
weekly
leave
benefit
14


amount
is
equal
to
the
weekly
leave
benefit
amount
of
a
person
15


whose
gross
weekly
earnings
are
35
percent
of
the
statewide
16


average
weekly
wage,
or
to
the
spendable
weekly
earnings
of
the
17


employee,
whichever
is
less.
“Spendable
weekly
earnings”
is
18


defined
in
the
bill
as
the
amount
remaining
after
payroll
taxes
19


are
deducted
from
an
employee’s
gross
weekly
earnings.
20


The
department
must
send
the
first
benefit
payment
to
an
21


eligible
employee
within
10
days
after
a
properly
completed
22


weekly
claim
for
benefits
is
received
by
the
department.
If
23


the
employee
continues
to
submit
a
properly
completed
weekly
24


claim,
subsequent
payments
are
to
be
made
to
the
employee
at
25


least
biweekly.
If
an
employer,
or
the
department,
contests
26


an
employee’s
eligibility,
benefit
payments
may
be
made
on
27


a
conditional
basis.
The
employee
is
required
to
pay
the
28


benefits
back
if
the
department
later
rules
that
the
employee
29


is
ineligible
to
receive
such
benefits.
30


The
bill
provides
that
the
program
shall
be
funded
via
31


employee
and
employer
contributions.
Beginning
on
January
1,
32


2022,
and
ending
on
December
31,
2023,
the
department
must
33


assess
a
covered
employer
a
premium
rate
of
four-tenths
of
one
34


percent
of
an
employee’s
weekly
wages,
subject
to
a
maximum

limit
of
wages
subject
to
the
assessment,
as
determined
by
1


the
director
based
on
the
maximum
wages
subject
to
taxation
2


for
social
security.
One-third
of
the
premium
is
to
be
used
3


to
fund
family
leave
insurance
benefits
and
two-thirds
of
the
4


premium
is
to
be
used
to
fund
medical
leave
benefits.
The
5


covered
employer
may
deduct
the
full
amount
of
the
family
leave
6


premium
from
an
employee’s
wage.
A
covered
employer
may
deduct
7


up
to
45
percent
of
the
medical
leave
premium
and
45
percent
of
8


the
family
leave
premium
from
an
employee’s
wage.
The
employer
9


must
pay
the
remaining
55
percent
of
both
the
medical
leave
and
10


family
leave
premiums,
and
may
elect
to
pay
all
or
any
portion
11


of
an
employee’s
share
of
such
premiums.
Beginning
January
12


1,
2024,
the
premium
rate
shall
be
calculated
by
the
director
13


based
on
the
family
leave
and
medical
leave
insurance
account
14


balance
ratio
as
of
September
30
of
the
previous
calendar
year.
15


The
premium
rate
is
adjusted
based
on
the
balance
ratio
as
16


detailed
in
the
bill.
If
the
balance
ratio
falls
below
five
17


hundredths
of
one
percent,
the
bill
requires
the
director
to
18


assess
a
solvency
surcharge
that
is
added
to
the
total
premium
19


rate
assessed
to
a
covered
employer.
The
minimum
solvency
20


surcharge
is
one-tenth
of
one
percent
and
the
maximum
is
21


six-tenths
of
one
percent.
22


On
September
30
of
each
year,
the
bill
requires
the
23


department
to
average
the
number
of
employees
reported
by
an
24


employer
over
the
last
four
completed
calendar
quarters
to
25


determine
if
the
employer
is
a
covered
employer
for
the
next
26


calendar
year.
27


The
bill
requires
a
covered
employer
to
collect
all
assessed
28


premiums
and
surcharges
from
the
employer’s
employees
through
29


payroll
deduction
and
to
remit
all
premiums
to
the
department
30


as
required
by
the
director.
31


An
employer
may
apply
for,
and
the
director
must
grant,
a
32


waiver
of
premiums
for
an
employee
who
is
located
physically
33


outside
of
the
state
and
not
expected
to
work
in
the
state
for
34


1,250
or
more
hours
in
any
consecutive
12-month
period.
If

the

subsequently
works
1,250
or
more
hours
within
1


the
state,
the
employer
and
employee
are
responsible
for
all
2


premiums
that
should
have
been
collected.
3


Self-employed
persons
may
elect
to
participate
in
the
4


program
for
a
minimum
initial
participation
period
of
three
5


years.
Any
subsequent
period
of
participation
must
be
for
6


a
minimum
of
one
year.
A
self-employed
person
must
pay
7


the
employee
and
employer’s
portion
of
the
premium
assessed
8


by
the
director.
A
self-employed
person
who
elects
to
9


participate
in
the
program
is
eligible
for
family
leave
and
10


medical
leave
benefits
after
working
a
minimum
of
1,250
hours
11


in
the
consecutive
12-month
period
immediately
following
12


the
person’s
election
to
participate
in
the
program.
The
13


self-employed
person
may
withdraw
from
the
program
by
providing
14


written
notice
to
the
director.
The
director
may
cancel
the
15


self-employed
person’s
elective
coverage
for
failure
to
submit
16


the
required
premiums.
17


An
eligible
employee
who
takes
family
leave
or
medical
leave
18


is
entitled
to
restoration
of
employment
equal
to
but
not
19


greater
than
that
provided
by
FMLA.
The
bill
provides
that
if
20


required
under
FMLA,
an
employer
must
maintain
any
existing
21


health
benefits
during
an
employee’s
leave.
If
the
employer
22


and
employee
normally
share
the
cost
of
such,
the
employee
is
23


responsible
for
paying
the
employee’s
share
of
the
costs.
24


A
covered
employer
must
submit
reports
as
required
by
the
25


director
and
maintain
employment
records
for
each
employee
26


from
which
the
director
may
obtain
information
related
to
an
27


employee’s
family
leave
or
medical
leave.
Such
records
must
28


be
maintained
for
10
years
from
the
date
on
which
an
employee
29


first
takes
a
family
leave
or
medical
leave.
30


The
bill
provides
that
family
leave
or
medical
leave
shall
31


be
in
addition
to
leave
required
under
state
or
federal
law
32


for
sickness
or
temporary
disability
due
to
pregnancy
or
33


childbirth.
The
bill
requires
family
leave
or
medical
leave
34


taken
under
this
program
to
be
taken
concurrently
with
leave

A

to
choose
to
use
either
accrued
sick

benefits,
or

family

and

An

at
the

time
the

employee
is
receiving

The
bill
prohibits
6


discrimination
on
the
basis
of
any

category.
8


The
bill
requires
the
director
to
administer
the
program
and

to
provide
outreach
to
ensure
that
employers
and
employees
are
10


aware

available
under
such.

and
the
account
can
15


only
be
used
for
the

The

requires
the

The
