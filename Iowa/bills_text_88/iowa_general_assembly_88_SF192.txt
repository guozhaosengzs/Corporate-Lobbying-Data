business
is
set

to
begin
in

year,
contingent

Currently,
the
capital
gain
deduction
for
the
sale
of
real
5


property
used
in
a
“farming
business”
set
to
go
into
effect
6


in

or
a
later
tax
year
restricts
the
deduction
to
the
7


sale
of
“real
property
used
in
a
farming
business”,
provided
8


the
taxpayer
“materially
participated”
in
the
farming
business
9


for
at
least
10
years,
held
the
real
property
for
at
least
10


10
years,
and
sold
the
real
property
to
a
“relative”,
all
as
11


defined
in
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161.
12


The
bill
modifies
the
restrictions
relating
to
the
deduction
13


for
the
sale
of
real
property
used
in
farming
business
by
14


permitting
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
deduction
if
one
of
the
15


following
apply:
the
taxpayer
“materially
participated”
in
16


the
farming
business
for
at
least
10

real
17


property
for
at
least
10
years;
or
the
taxpayer
sold
the
real
18


property
to
a

The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
19


“relative”
to
include
an
entity
in
which
a
relative
of
the
20


taxpayer
has
a
legal
or
equitable
interest
in
the
entity
as
an
21


owner,
member,
partner,
or
beneficiary.
22


The
bill
also
modifies
the
definitions
of
“farming
business”
23


and
“real
property
used
in
a
farming
business”.
The
bill
24


defines
“livestock”
to
mean
the
same
as
defined
in
Code
section
25


717.1,
which
is
used
in
the
definition
of
farming
business.
26


The
bill
strikes
provisions
related
to
restricting
the
27


capital
gain
deduction
for
the
sale
of
real
property
used
in
a
28


farming
business
if
the
relative
sells
or
transfers
the
real
29


property
used
in
a
farming
business
within
five
years
of
the
30


original
sale.
31


The
bill
also
strikes
a
provision
providing
that
to
the
32


extent
otherwise
allowed,
the
capital
gain
deduction
for
the
33


sale
of
real
property
used
in
a
“farming
business”
shall
not
be
34


allowed
