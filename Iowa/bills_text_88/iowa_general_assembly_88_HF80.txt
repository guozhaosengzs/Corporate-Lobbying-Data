2.
The
purpose
of
this
chapter
is
to
identify
actions
which
18


threaten
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
and
to
impose
19


significant
sanctions
upon
persons
who
intentionally
commit
20


those
acts.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
21


offenses
with
the
greatest
potential
to
affect
the
election
22


process
be
vigorously
prosecuted
and
strong
punishment
meted
23


out
through
the
imposition
of
felony
sanctions
which,
as


24


a
consequence,
remove
the
voting
rights
of
the
offenders
.
25


Other
offenses
are
still
considered
serious,
but
based
on
the
26


factual
context
in
which
they
arise,
they
may
not
rise
to
27


the
level
of
offenses
to
which
felony
penalties
attach.
The
28


general
assembly
also
recognizes
that
instances
may
arise
in
29


which
technical
infractions
of
chapters
39
through
53
may
30


occur
which
do
not
merit
any
level
of
criminal
sanction.
31


In
such
instances,
administrative
notice
from
the
state
or


32


county
commissioner
of
elections
is
sufficient.
Mandates
33


or
proscriptions
in
chapters
39
through
53
which
are
not
34


specifically
included
in
this
chapter

EXPLANATION
6


The

does
not
constitute

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

Article
II,
section
5,
of
the
Constitution
of
the
State
of
9


Iowa
denies
the
privilege
of
an
elector
to
any
person
convicted
10


of
an
infamous
crime.
State
statute
defines
infamous
crime
as
11


a
felony
conviction
under
state
or
federal
law.
State
law
also
12


allows
a
person
who
has
been
discharged
from
parole,
probation,
13


or
work
release,
or
who
has
been
released
from
incarceration
14


upon
completion
of
sentence,
to
apply
to
the
governor
for
15


restoration
of
the
rights
of
citizenship,
which
include
the
16


rights
to
register
to
vote
and
to
vote.
State
statute
also
17


requires
that
a
candidate
for
elective
office
under
the
laws
of
18


the
state
must
be
an
eligible
elector
at
the
time
of
election.
19


By
operation
of
law,
this
excludes
persons
who
have
been
20


convicted
of
a
state
or
federal
felony
and
not
had
their
rights
21


of
citizenship
restored
by
the
governor
or
the
president
of
the
22


United
States.
23


This
bill
alters
the
definition
of
“infamous
crime”
to
24


include
only
vote
fraud
that
is
election
misconduct
in
the
25


first
degree
under
Code
section
39A.2.
The
bill
also
limits
26


the
disqualification
from
holding
the
privilege
of
an
elector
27


due
to
conviction
of
an
infamous
crime
to
the
period
of
the
28


convicted
person’s
sentence.
A
convicted
person’s
right
29


to
vote
and
hold
office
is
restored
automatically
upon
the
30


discharge
of
that
person’s
sentence,
including
any
period
of
31


probation
or
parole,
but
not
including
the
payment
of
fines,
32


fees,
or
restitution.
33


The
bill
removes
references
to
conviction
of
a
felony
under
34


federal
law.
