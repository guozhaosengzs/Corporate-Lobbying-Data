The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
9


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
10


This
bill
relates
to
the
state
general
fund
expenditure
11


limitation
by
revising
calculation
requirements
for
the
12


limitation,
creating
a
safety
net
fund,
making
transfers,
13


and
providing
for
related
state
personal
income
tax
rate
14


reductions.
15


The
bill
amends
Code
section
8.54,
relating
to
the
state
16


general
fund
expenditure
limitation,
to
provide
an
additional
17


method
for
calculating
the
limitation.
Under
current
law,
the
18


limitation
is
99
percent
of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
19


the
following
fiscal
year
based
on
an
estimate
approved
by
the
20


revenue
estimating
conference
in
a
meeting
held
by
December
21


15.
The
new
calculation
method
in
the
bill
is
based
on
the
22


growth
in
the
average
wage
and
salary
component
of
the
state
23


personal
income
table
for
Iowa
issued
each
quarter
by
the
24


bureau
of
economic
analysis
of
the
United
States
department
of
25


commerce.
Under
the
new
method,
the
department
of
management
26


and
the
legislative
services
agency
are
directed
to
apply
the
27


component
issued
for
the
quarters
of
a
two-year
period
to
28


jointly
calculate
a
wage
and
salary
growth
factor
percentage.
29


One-half
of
this
percentage
amount,
combined
with
100
percent,
30


is
applied
to
the
amount
of
the
state
general
fund
expenditure
31


limitation
for
the
prior
fiscal
year
(fiscal
year
in
progress).
32


The
lesser
amount
identified
by
the
two
methods
is
required
to
33


be
used
as
the
state
general
fund
expenditure
limitation
in
the
34


budget
process
for
the
following
fiscal
year.

Under
current
law,
if
a
surplus
is
anticipated
for
the
1


general
fund
of
the
state
at
the
close
of
a
fiscal
year,
any
2


excess
remaining,
after
the
surplus
is
applied
to
bring
state
3


reserve
funds
to
their
maximum
balances,
is
transferred
back
4


to
the
state
general
fund
for
the
following
fiscal
year.
The
5


original
state
general
fund
expenditure
limitation
for
that
6


following
fiscal
year
is
required
to
be
readjusted
to
reflect
7


the
amount
of
excess
anticipated
to
be
transferred.
The
bill
8


strikes
the
current
law
requirements
for
the
excess
in
Code
9


sections
8.54(5)
and
8.55(2)
and
instead
requires
the
excess
10


to
be
transferred
to
the
safety
net
fund
created
by
the
bill,
11


up
to
the
maximum
balance
for
the
safety
net
fund
which
is
12


established
at
2
percent
of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
13


the
fiscal
year,
and
then
entire
remainder
to
be
transferred
to
14


the
taxpayer
relief
fund.
15


The
bill
creates
a
safety
net
fund
separate
from
the
16


general
fund.
Moneys
in
the
fund
must
only
be
used
pursuant
17


to
appropriations
or
transfers
made
by
the
general
assembly
18


to
augment
appropriations
made
for
important
education,
19


employment,
health,
human
services,
and
other
programs
to
aid
20


individuals
and
families
with
low
income.
Moneys
in
the
safety
21


net
fund
are
treated
similarly
to
other
reserve
funds
under
22


Code
section
8.58
and
exempted
from
automatic
application
in
23


triggering
mechanisms
which
affect
appropriations,
payments,
or
24


taxation
rates,
and
cannot
be
considered
by
an
arbitrator
or
in
25


collective
bargaining
negotiations
under
Code
chapter
20.
26


Moneys
transferred
to
the
taxpayer
relief
fund
are
required
27


to
be
transferred
to
the
general
fund
of
the
state
by
the
28


end
of
the
same
fiscal
year
and
treated
as
a
replacement
of
29


revenue
resulting
from
the
individual
income
tax
rate
reduction
30


provided
for
in
the
bill.
31


For
tax
years
beginning
January
1
immediately
preceding
July
32


1
of
a
fiscal
year
in
which
a
transfer
is
made
from
the
taxpayer
33


relief
fund
to
the
general
fund,
the
rates
for
each
of
the
nine
34


tax
brackets
of
the
individual
income
tax
are
required
to
be

reduced
by
the
percentage
that
the
amount
transferred
to
the
1


general
fund
bears
to
the
state’s
actual
net
revenue
for
the
2


preceding
fiscal
year.
Tax
rate
reductions
only
apply
for
one
3


tax
year
and
do
not
affect
tax
rates
in
any
successive
tax
4


year.
Withholding
agents
and
employers
are
prohibited
from
5


factoring
in
such
an
individual
income
tax
rate
reduction
in
6


their
calculation
of
appropriate
employee
withholding
amounts
7


during
a
tax
year.
Under
the
bill,
the
tax
year
beginning
8


January
1,
2021,
is
the
first
tax
year
to
which
the
individual
9


income
tax
rate
reduction
may
apply.
10


The
bill
takes
effect
July
1,
2020.
However,
the
provisions
11


affecting
calculation
of
the
state
general
fund
expenditure
12


limitation
are
first
applicable
for
the
budget
process
for
FY
13


2020-2021.
