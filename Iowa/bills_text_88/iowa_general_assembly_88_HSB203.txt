The

to

certain

the

of
the
insurance
commissioner
20


and
the
courts
of
this
state
in
suits

of
the

state
and

or
beneficiaries
under
insurance
contracts.
22


The
general
assembly
hereby
declares
that
it
is
a
subject
23


of
concern
that
many
residents
of
this
state
hold
policies
24


of
insurance
issued
by
persons
and
insurers
not
authorized
25


to
do
insurance
business
in
this
state,
thus
presenting
to
26


such
residents
the
often
insuperable
obstacle
of
asserting
27


their
legal
rights
under
such
policies
in
forums
foreign
to
28


them
under
laws
and
rules
of
practice
with
which
they
are
29


not
familiar.
The
general
assembly
further
declares
that
it
30


is
also
concerned
with
the
protection
of
residents
of
this
31


state
against
acts
by
persons
and
insurers
not
authorized
to
32


do
an
insurance
business
in
this
state,
by
the
maintenance
of
33


fair
and
honest
insurance
markets,
by
protecting
the
premium

revenues
of
this
state,

In

such
state
interest,
in
this
chapter

the
general
assembly
herein


provides
methods
for

service

proceeding,
