This
bill
relates
to
the
mailing
of
absentee
ballots.
1


The
bill
requires
county
commissioners
of
elections
to
2


automatically
mail
absentee
ballots
to
all
registered
voters.
3


Current
law
requires
registered
voters
to
submit
an
application
4


prior
to
receiving
an
absentee
ballot.
The
bill
also
allows
5


county
commissioners
to
establish
drop
boxes
at
which
voters
6


or
voters’
designees
may
deposit
absentee
ballots.
The
bill
7


requires
the
state
commissioner
of
elections
to
adopt
rules
8


regarding
security
measures
for
absentee
ballot
drop
boxes.
9


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
10


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
11


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
12


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
13


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
14


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
15


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
