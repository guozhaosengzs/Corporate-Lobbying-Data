within

hours
from

is
filed.
The

However,

of

2.
Upon
a
determination
by
the
department
that
exigent

exist,
the
dispositional

may
be



conducted
by
an
administrative
law
judge
in

The

designee
pursuant

3.
a.
A
court
or
administrative
law
judge
shall
issue
an



order
for
the
disposition
of
the
animal
after
making
any
of
the



following
determinations:



(1)
That
no
interested
person
holds
a
legal
interest
in



the
seized
animal.
In
that
case,
the
animal
shall
be
deemed



abandoned
and
the
order
shall
extinguish
all
prior
legal



interests
in
the
animal.
The
order
shall
grant
an
undivided



ownership
interest
in
the
animal
free
from
any
security



interest
or
other
agricultural
lien
or
encumbrance
to
the



department.



(2)
That
an
interested
person
holds
a
legal
interest
in



the
seized
animal,
and
the
department
has
reasonable
suspicion



to
believe
that
the
animal
has
been
exposed
to
an
infectious



or
contagious
disease.
In
that
case,
the
order
shall
provide



for
the
disposition
of
the
animal
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the



department
had
identified
the
animal
as
having
been
exposed
to



the
infectious
or
contagious
disease
under
the
authorization



provided
in
section
163.3D.



(3)
That
a
person
holds
a
legal
interest
in
the
seized



animal,
and
there
is
no
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
seized



animal
has
been
exposed
to
an
infectious
or
contagious
disease.



In
that
case,
the
order
shall
direct
the
department
to
transfer



custody
of
the
animal
to
the
interested
person.
In
the
event



the
animal
is
returned
to
the
interested
person,
the
department



shall
not
be
subject
to
any
claim
for
damages
caused
by
the



seizure
if
the
department’s
actions
were
taken

set
forth
in

subsection
3.



b.
A
reasonable
suspicion
asserted
by
the
department
may



be
based
on
any
credible
evidence
that
shows
the
animal’s



possible
exposure
to
an
infectious
or
contagious
disease
or
the



animal
was
abandoned.
This
paragraph
“b”
does
not
require
the



department
to
conduct
a
test
of
an
animal
to
determine
whether



an
animal
has
been
exposed.



c.
If
two
or
more
interested
parties
may
be
transferred



custody
of
an
animal
by
the
department
pursuant
to
paragraph



“a”
,
subparagraph

to
transfer
the

otherwise
to
the
interested
person
best
able

the



animal
without
prejudicing
the
rights
of
any
other
interested



person.
However,
in
any

of
action
brought
by
an



interested

contesting
the
order
to

the

If
more
than
one

legal
interest



in
the

of
legal
interest
in
the



seized
animal
held
by
each

The
amount
paid



to
