The
taxpayers

fund
is
established
in
the
bill
as
27


separate
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
to
be
used
for

appropriations
for

The
bill
creates
a
taxpayers
trust
fund
tax
credit
and
2


provides
for
the
transfer
of
moneys
from
the
taxpayers
trust
3


fund
for
purposes
of
the
credit.
The
taxpayers
trust
fund
4


tax
credit
is
available
to
an
“eligible
individual”,
which
is
5


defined
as
an
individual
who
timely
files
an
Iowa
individual
6


income
tax
return,
including
extensions,
but
not
including
7


an
estate
or
trust.
The
credit
is
allowed
for
any
tax
year
8


beginning
January
1
immediately
preceding
July
1
of
any
fiscal
9


year
in
which
a
transfer
is
made
from
the
taxpayers
trust
10


fund
for
purposes
of
the
credit.
The
credit
will
be
equal
11


to
the
amount
transferred
divided
by
the
number
of
eligible
12


individuals
for
the
previous
tax
year,
rounded
down
to
the
13


nearest
whole
dollar.
The
credit
may
be
claimed
against
any
14


individual
income
tax
liability
remaining
after
subtracting
15


all
refundable
and
nonrefundable
credits
except
the
credits
16


for
withheld
tax
and
estimated
tax
paid.
The
tax
credit
is
17


nonrefundable
and
may
not
be
carried
forward
or
back
to
a
18


different
tax
year.
In
order
to
administer
the
credit,
the
19


bill
creates
an
Iowa
taxpayers
trust
fund
tax
credit
fund
20


within
the
state
treasury
under
the
control
of
the
department
21


of
revenue.
Transfers
from
the
taxpayers
trust
fund
for
22


purposes
of
the
credit
are
placed
into
this
fund
and
used
23


to
reimburse
the
general
fund
of
the
state
for
the
amount
24


of
credits
claimed.
Any
moneys
in
the
fund
which
represent
25


unclaimed
tax
credits
immediately
revert
back
to
the
taxpayers
26


trust
fund.
An
“unclaimed
tax
credit”
means
the
amount
by
27


which
the
credits
that
were
eligible
to
be
claimed
by
eligible
28


individuals
exceeds
the
credits
actually
claimed
by
eligible
29


individuals.
The
bill
provides
for
a
transfer
from
the
30


taxpayers
trust
fund
during
fiscal
year
2022-2023
for
purposes
31


of
the

The

of
the

trust
fund
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
33
