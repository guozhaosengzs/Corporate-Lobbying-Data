The

27


relating
to
the
carrying
of

by

commit
the
criminal

of
carrying
2


firearms
on
school
grounds
in

The

strikes
Code
section

relating
to
a

15


duty
to
carry
a
valid
permit
to
carry
certain
weapons

Code
section

a
provision
stating
that
the
availability
18


of
a
professional
or
nonprofessional
permit
to
carry

19


shall
not
be
