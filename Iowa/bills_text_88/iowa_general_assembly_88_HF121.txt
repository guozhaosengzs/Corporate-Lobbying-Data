This

provides
that
the
state
minimum
hourly
wage
20


applicable
to
newly
hired
employees
is
applicable
until
an
21


employee

an

Under

bill
strikes
the
current
state
minimum

rate
of
24


$6.35
prescribed
for
newly
hired
employees
and
instead
provides
25


that

minimum

is
88
percent
of
the
regular

30


an

motel,
inn,
or
cabin
who
31


customarily
and
regularly
receives
more
than
$30
a
month
32


in
tips.
The
regular
state
minimum
hourly
wage
would
be
33


applicable
to
such
employees.
