beginning

for

EXPLANATION
14


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
15


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
16


This
bill
creates
a
workforce
child
care
facility
incentives
17


program
(program)
that
will
be
administered
by
the
economic
18


development
authority
(EDA)
and
that
will
provide
tax
19


incentives
to
developers
that
complete
child
care
facility
20


projects
in
the
state.
A
“developer”
is
defined
in
the
bill.
21


In
order
to
qualify
for
the
tax
incentives
under
the
program,
a
22


child
care
facility
project
must
meet
certain
requirements.
23


First,
the
project
includes
at
least
one
of
the
following:
24


the
construction
of
a
new
structure
to
be
used
as
a
child
care
25


facility;
or
the
rehabilitation,
repair,
or
redevelopment
of
26


an
existing
structure
to
be
used
as
a
child
care
facility.
27


Second,
the
child
care
facility,
when
completed,
meets
all
28


applicable
safety
standards
under
Code
chapter
237A.
29


A
developer
seeking
tax
incentives
for
a
child
care
facility
30


project
under
the
bill
is
required
to
apply
to
the
EDA.
The
31


application
must
include
a
resolution
in
support
of
the
child
32


care
facility
project
by
the
community
where
the
project
will
33


be
located,
except
in
situations
where
the
child
care
facility
34


will
be
exclusively
used
by
the
employees
of
a
business,
and

include
documentation
of
local
matching
funds
in
an
amount
1


equal
to
at
least
$50,000,
or
in
the
case
of
a
small
city
in
an
2


amount
equal
to
at
least
$25,000,
and
other
information
for
the
3


EDA
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
and
financial
need
of
the
child
4


care
facility
project
under
the
program.
The
bill
defines
5


“small
city”
to
mean
any
city
or
township
located
in
this
6


state,
except
those
located
wholly
within
one
or
more
of
the
11
7


most
populous
counties
in
the
state,
as
determined
by
the
most
8


recent
population
estimates
issued
by
the
United
States
bureau
9


of
the
census.
10


The
bill
requires
the
EDA
to
review
and
score
each
11


application
on
a
competitive
basis
based
upon
the
rules
of
the
12


EDA.
The
EDA
is
required
to
notify
a
developer
of
a
successful
13


application
and
the
amount
of
tax
incentives
for
which
the
EDA
14


preliminarily
determines
it
qualifies
for
under
the
bill.
A
15


developer
is
then
required
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
16


EDA
for
the
successful
completion
of
its
child
care
facility
17


project
within
three
years
from
the
date
it
was
registered
by
18


the
EDA.
The
bill
also
assesses
a
compliance
cost
fee
in
the
19


amount
of
$500.
20


If
the
EDA
determines
the
developer
to
be
in
default
under
21


the
agreement,
the
bill
requires
the
EDA
to
revoke
the
tax
22


incentive
award,
and
to
not
issue
the
tax
credit
certificate
or
23


a
sales
and
use
tax
refund.
The
bill
requires
the
EDA
to
adopt
24


rules
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
17A
to
specify
what
constitutes
25


a
default
of
the
agreement.
26


Upon
completion
of
a
child
care
facility
project,
the
27


bill
requires
the
developer
to
have
its
project
audited
by
28


an
independent
certified
public
accountant
licensed
in
this
29


state.
The
EDA
will
then
review
the
audit,
verify
the
amount
30


of
workforce
child
care
facility
tax
credits
the
developer
may
31


claim,
and
issue
a
tax
credit
certificate
for
that
amount.


32


The
bill
limits
the
amount
of
tax
incentives
for
child
care


33


facility
projects
at
$3
million
in
the
aggregate
per
fiscal
34


year.

The
bill
specifies
that
of
the
maximum
tax
incentive
amounts
1


available
each
fiscal
year,
60
percent
shall
be
awarded
to
2


small
cities.
If
the
amount
of
tax
credits
reserved
for
small
3


cities
has
not
been
distributed
by
May
1
of
any
calendar
year,
4


the
remaining
reserved
tax
credits
shall
be
available
to
any
5


other
eligible
applicants.

The
maximum
amount
of
tax
incentives
that
may
be
awarded
by
7


the
EDA
to
a
developer
for
a
child
care
facility
project
shall
8


not
exceed
$200,000.
9


The
bill
provides
two
different
tax
incentives.
The
first
10


is
a
refund
of
the
sales
and
use
taxes
paid
that
are
directly
11


related
to
the
child
care
facility
project.
The
second
is
12


a
workforce
child
care
facility
investment
tax
credit
in
13


an
amount
not
to
exceed
20
percent
of
the
qualifying
new
14


investment
of
the
child
care
facility
project
in
a
small
15


city,
and
10
percent
of
the
qualifying
new
investment
of
the
16


child
care
facility
project
in
any
other
area.
“Qualifying
17


new
investment”
means
the
costs
directly
related
to
the
18


construction,
repair,
rehabilitation,
or
redevelopment
of
the
19


child
care
facility.
20


The
workforce
child
care
facility
investment
tax
credit
may
21


be
claimed
against
the
individual
income
tax,
the
corporate
22


income
tax,
the
franchise
tax,
the
insurance
companies
tax,
and
23


the
moneys
and
credits
tax.
To
claim
a
tax
credit,
a
taxpayer
24


must
include
a
tax
credit
certificate
with
the
taxpayer’s
25


tax
return.
The
credit
is
nonrefundable
but
may
be
credited
26


to
the
tax
liability
for
five
years.
The
tax
credit
may
be
27


transferred
to
any
person
or
entity,
and
the
bill
establishes
28


procedures
for
the
proper
transfer
of
the
tax
credit.
For
29


purposes
of
the
individual
and
corporate
income
taxes
and
the
30


franchise
tax,
when
the
tax
basis
of
property
is
increased
as
31


a
result
of
qualifying
new
investment,
that
tax
basis
shall
32


be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
workforce
child
care
facility
33


investment
tax
credit
issued
under
the
program.

The
bill
applies
to
