PROSECUTION
BY
ATTORNEY
GENERAL.
The
bill
authorizes
the
1


attorney
general
to
prosecute
a
criminal
offense
committed
by
a
2


law
enforcement
officer
arising
from
the
actions
of
the
officer
3


resulting
in
the
death
of
another,
regardless
of
whether
the
4


county
attorney
requests
the
assistance
of
the
attorney
general
5


or
decides
to
independently
prosecute
the
criminal
offense
6


committed
by
the
officer.
If
the
attorney
general
determines
7


that
criminal
charges
are
not
appropriate,
the
bill
authorizes
8


the
attorney
general
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
Iowa
law
9


enforcement
academy
council
(council)
to
recommend
revocation
10


or
suspension
of
the
officer’s
certification.
11


USE
OF

BY
PEACE
OFFICERS.
The
bill
provides
12


that
the
use
of
a
chokehold,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
by
a
13


peace
officer
while
making
an
arrest
is
only
justified
when
14


the
person
being
arrested
has
used
or
threatened
to
use
15


deadly
force
in
committing
a
felony,
or
when
the
peace
officer
16


reasonably
believes
the
person
would
use
deadly
force
against
17


any
person
unless
immediately
apprehended.
These
are
the
same
18


circumstances
under
which
the
use
of
deadly
force
by
a
peace
19


officer
during
an
arrest
is
justified
under
current
law.

and
the

25


under
which

bill
requires
an
employing
27


agency

days
of
any

28


of
employment
of
a
law

31


a

of
law
32


enforcement
officers
who
have
been
certified
in
another
state.
33


The
bill
requires
that

submit,
under
oath,
a

for

through
examination
2


to
the
council
which
shall
include
but
not
be
limited
to
an
3


attestation
by
the
applicant
to
whether
the
applicant
has
4


had
the
officer’s
certification
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
5


revoked
or
suspended
in
another
state;
has
pled
guilty

has
been

7


misconduct
from
employment
as
a
law
enforcement
officer;
8


or
has
left,
voluntarily
quit,
or
been
laid
off
when
the
9


applicant
knew
or
believed
that
disciplinary
investigation
10


or
action
was
imminent
or
pending
which
could
have
resulted
11


in
the
law
enforcement
officer
being
discharged
for
serious
12


misconduct.
If
the
council
denies
the
preliminary
application
13


for
certification
through
examination,
the
applicant
shall
14


be
prohibited
from
continued
employment
as

LAW
ENFORCEMENT
TRAINING
——
DE-ESCALATION
TECHNIQUES
AND
17


PREVENTION
OF
BIAS.
The
bill
requires
a
law
enforcement
agency
18


to
provide
annual
training
to
every
law
enforcement
officer
19


employed
by
the
law
enforcement
agency
on
issues
relating
to
20


de-escalation
techniques
and
the
prevention
of
bias.
The
21


bill
requires
the
Iowa
law
enforcement
academy
to
develop
and
22


disseminate
training
guidelines
meeting
certain
requirements
23


set
forth
in
the
bill,
in
consultation
with
certain
parties
24


including
the
Iowa
civil
rights
commission.
25


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
26


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
27


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
28


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
29


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
30


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
31


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
