This

eliminates
the

other
entity
approved
by

19


period

21


practices.
The

documented
in
the
patient’s
record
29


and

prescriber
must
be
notified

a
result

otherwise

prescription
based
solely
on
the
33


pharmacist’s
adaptation
of
the
prescription.

is
2


unable

the

or
an

26


and

and
ranking
28


members
of
