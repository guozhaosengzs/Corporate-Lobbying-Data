EXPLANATION
12


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
13


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
14


This
bill
strikes
provisions
authorizing
a
court
or
15


governmental
entity
to
order
a
person
to
participate
in
the
16


sobriety
and
drug
monitoring
program
(program)
as
a
condition
17


of
a
temporary
restricted
driver’s
license.
The
bill
also
18


eliminates
the
requirement
that
a
person
who
has
been
ordered
19


to
participate
in
the
program
by
a
court
or
governmental
20


entity,
and
whose
driver’s
license
is
suspended
or
revoked,
be
21


eligible
for
a
temporary
restricted
license
before
beginning
22


participation
in
the
program
or
being
subject
to
testing
23


required
by
the
program.
24


The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
that
the
department
of
25


transportation
(DOT)
must
require
a
person
to
participate
in
26


the
program
if
the
person
is
required
to
install
an
ignition
27


interlock
device
under
Code
chapter
321J.
The
bill
also
28


eliminates
the
requirement
that
a
person
must
install
an
29


approved
ignition
interlock
device
on
all
motor
vehicles
owned
30


or
operated
by
the
person
in
order
to
participate
in
the
31


program.
However,
the
bill
does
not
amend
or
eliminate
any
32


separate
requirement
to
install
an
approved
ignition
interlock
33


device
that
may
exist
based
on
the
person’s
underlying
offense.
34


The
bill
instead
requires
an
order
or
directive

participant
in
the
program
to
require
the
participant
to
submit
1


to
the
law
enforcement
agency
of
the
participating
jurisdiction
2


proof
that
the
participant
has
installed
an
approved
ignition
3


interlock
device
on
all
motor
vehicles
owned
or
operated
by
the
4


participant
prior
to
the
end
of
participation
in
the
program.
5


However,
the
bill
provides
an
exception
to
the
ignition
6


interlock
device
requirement
if
the
participant,
at
the
time
7


the
participant
completes
the
program,
will
be
ineligible
for
a
8


temporary
restricted
license
or
will
not
own
a
motor
vehicle
or
9


have
a
motor
vehicle
registered
in
the
participant’s
name.
10


The
bill
eliminates
the
DOT
from
reporting
requirements
11


under
Code
chapter
901D.
The
bill
repeals
a
future
repeal
12


provision
relating
to
references
to
the
program
in
Code
chapter
13


321J
that
are
stricken
by
the
bill.
The
bill
does
not
amend
or
14


repeal
the
future
repeal
date
for
the
program
in
Code
section
15


901D.10.
