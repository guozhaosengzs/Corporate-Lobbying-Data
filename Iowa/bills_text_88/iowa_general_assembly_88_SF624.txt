EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
17


IOWA
FINANCE
AUTHORITY.
This
bill
amends
provisions
18


in
several
Code
chapters,
including
Code
chapter
16,
which
19


governs
the
Iowa
finance
authority
(IFA).
IFA
is
under
the
20


jurisdiction
of
a
board
of
directors.
The
Code
chapter
also
21


provides
for
several
other
boards,
including
the
agricultural
22


development
board,
which
oversees
programs
associated
with
23


beginning
farmers.
The
bill
provides
that
the
agricultural
24


development
board
is
to
designate
one
of
its
members
to
serve
25


on
IFA’s
board
of
directors.
26


TAXPAYERS
AND
FARMERS
QUALIFYING
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
THE
27


BEGINNING
FARMER
TAX
PROGRAM.
The
bill
creates
a
beginning
28


farmer
tax
credit
program,
which
replaces
the
agricultural
29


assets
transfer
tax
credit,
under
IFA’s
jurisdiction.
30


Under
the
program,
an
eligible
taxpayer
(taxpayer)
who
31


holds
agricultural
assets
(agricultural
land,
depreciable
32


agricultural
property,
crops,
or
livestock)
and
who
assists
33


a
qualified
beginning
farmer
(farmer)
acquire
agricultural
34


assets
by
a
form
of
specified
legal
arrangement
is
entitled
35


-16-


LSB
1882SZ
(4)
88


da/jh


16/
19



S.F.
624


to
claim
a
tax
credit
against
the
taxpayer’s
individual
or
1


corporate
income
tax
liability.
Specifically,
the
taxpayer
2


must
be
eligible
to
hold
agricultural
land
generally
under
3


Iowa’s
corporate
farming
law
(e.g.,
as
an
individual,
4


partnership,
family
farm
corporation,
or
family
farm
limited
5


liability
company).
The
taxpayer
must
not
have
been
at
fault
6


for
terminating
a
prior
agreement
in
which
the
taxpayer
was
7


able
to
claim
a
tax
credit.
The
taxpayer
must
enter
into
an
8


agricultural
lease
agreement
(agreement)
with
the
farmer
who
9


must
be
an
individual,
partnership,
family
farm
corporation,
or
10


family
farm
limited
liability
company.
In
addition,
the
farmer
11


must
be
a
resident
of
this
state;
have
sufficient
education,
12


training,
or
experience
in
farming;
have
access
to
adequate
13


working
capital
and
production
items;
must
materially
and
14


substantially
participate
in
farming;
and
not
own
more
than
a
15


10
percent
ownership
interest
in
an
agricultural
asset
included
16


in
the
agreement.
17


BEGINNING
FARMER
TAX
CREDIT.
The
tax
credit
is
calculated
18


based
on
the
type
of
rent
payment
arrangement
agreed
to
19


by
the
parties,
which
is
either
on
a
cash
basis
in
which
a
20


fixed
payment
is
made
or
a
commodity
share
basis
in
which
the
21


taxpayer
takes
a
percentage
of
the
crop
or
livestock
produced.
22


The
tax
credit
also
takes
into
account
special
risk-sharing
23


arrangements
in
which
the
parties
agree
to
adjust
the
rent
24


amount
based
on
some
future
happening
(e.g.,
crop
yield).
For
25


an
agreement
which
includes
a
rent
payable
on
a
cash
basis,
26


the
tax
credit
amount
equals
5
percent
of
the
gross
amount
27


paid
to
the
taxpayer
under
the
agreement.
For
an
agreement
28


which
includes
rent
payable
on
a
commodity
share
basis,
the
29


tax
credit
amount
equals
15
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
30


the
eligible
taxpayer
from
crops
or
livestock
sold
under
the
31


agreement.
In
the
case
of
a
flexible
arrangement
in
which
32


some
risk
is
shared
between
the
parties,
the
tax
credit
amount
33


equals
15
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
taxpayer
as
a
34


percentage
of
the
gross
value
of
the
commodity.

credit

APPLICATIONS
AND
CERTIFICATES.
The
agricultural
development
2


board
is
required
to
review
and
IFA
is
required
to
approve
3


applications
for
the
tax
credit.
As
part
of
this
process,
4


IFA
must
calculate
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit
that
may
be
5


awarded
to
that
applicant.
IFA
must
approve
all
applications
6


on
a
first-come,
first-served
basis
and
issue
tax
credit
7


certificates
to
approved
taxpayers.
IFA
is
allowed
to
issue
8


up
to
$12
million
in
tax
credit
certificates
each
tax
year,
an
9


increase
from
$6
million
under
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
10


tax
credit.
11


APPLICABILITY
OF
PRIOR
TAX
CREDITS.
The
bill
provides
for
12


cases
in
which
the
former
version
of
the
beginning
farmer
tax
13


credit
(the
agricultural
transfer
tax
credit)
may
govern
under
14


repealed
Code
section
16.80,
and
cases
in
which
that
tax
credit
15


and
the
now
repealed
custom
farming
tax
credit
under
repealed
16


Code
section
16.81
may
continue
to
be
carried
forward.
17


BACKGROUND.
The
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
18


was
first
established
in
2006
(2006
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161)
19


and
has
been
subsequently
amended.
Another
form
of
a
tax
20


credit
assisting
beginning
farmers,
referred
to
as
the
custom
21


farming
contract
tax
credit,
was
established
in
2013
(2013
Iowa
22


Acts,
chapter
125).
Both
tax
credits
were
under
the
beginning
23


farmer
tax
credit
program
and
administered
by
the
agricultural
24


development
board
(board)
acting
as
the
agricultural
25


development
authority
and
subject
to
a
limit
of
$12
million.
26


The
program
was
transferred
to
IFA
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
27


100,
and
2014
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1080).
Amendments
to
the
28


agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
the
custom
farming
29


contract
tax
credit
were
repealed
on
December
31,
2017
(2013
30


Iowa
Acts,
chapter
125),
except
for
a
provision
which
extended
31


the
tax
credit
carryover
from
5
to
10
years.
The
funding
limit
32


was
restored
to
its
present
$6
million
limit.
33


EFFECTIVE
AND
