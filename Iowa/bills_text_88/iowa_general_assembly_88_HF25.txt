EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
relates
to
payments
for
accrued
vacation
time
and
20


for
accrued
paid
time
off
for
all
employees
who
are
terminated
21


or
suspended.
22


Current
law
requires
an
employer
to
pay
accrued
vacation
pay
23


to
a
terminated
or
suspended
employee
only
if
the
employer
has
24


a
policy,
procedure,
or
contract
that
requires
the
employer
to
25


do
so.
26


The
bill
provides
that
if
an
employee
is
suspended
or
27


terminated,
upon
request
the
employer
must
pay
all
earned
28


wages,
now
including
paid
time
off,
by
the
next
regular
payday.
29


The
bill
provides
for
an
employee
who
earned
paid
time
off
30


while
employed
but
did
not
earn
vacation,
that
the
employer
may
31


reduce
the
pay
for
the
accrued
paid
time
off
by
one-third.
For
32


an
employee
who
earned
both
vacation
and
paid
time
off
while
33


employed,
the
employer
is
not
required
to
make
payment
for
the
34


paid
time
off.

The
bill
prohibits
an
employer
from
adopting
a
policy
or
1


practice
to
deny
payment
for
accrued
vacation
or
accrued
paid
2


time
off
upon
the
suspension
or
termination
of
an

3


unless
the
employee’s

ended
due
to
misconduct.
4


Misconduct
is
defined
in
the
department
of
workforce
5


development’s
administrative
rules.
6


The
bill
provides
for
the
calculation
and
payment
of
an
7


employee’s
accrued
paid
time
off
or
vacation
if
the
employee
8


is
suspended
or
terminated.
The
amount
of
such
pay
owed
to
an
9


employee
is
the
amount
of
pay
equal
to
the
accrued
vacation
or
10


paid
time
off
as
if
the
employee
began
taking
the
vacation
or
11


paid
time
off
the
day
the
suspension
or
termination
took
place,
12


unless
otherwise
provided
in
the
bill.
13


The
bill
defines
“paid
time
off”
as
a
benefit
allowing
an
14


employee
to
take
time
off
from
work
with
pay
without
regard
to
15


the
reason
the
employee
chooses
to
take
the
time
off.
“Paid
16


time
off”
is
also
added
to
the
definition
of
“wages”.
17


Unpaid
wages
or
expenses,
along
with
liquidated
damages,
18


court
costs,
and
attorney’s
fees,
may
be
recovered
by
the
19


employee
or
the
commissioner
by
civil
action
under
Code
chapter
20


91A.
An
employer
who
violates
Code
chapter
91A
is
also
subject
21


to
a
civil
penalty
of
not
more
than
$500
per
pay
period
for
each
22


violation.
23


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
The
bill
applies
only
24


to
the
suspension
or
termination
of
an
employee’s
employment
25


that
occurs
on
or
after
that
date.
