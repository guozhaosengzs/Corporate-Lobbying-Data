EXPLANATION
23


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of

general
assembly.
25


This
bill
concerns
the
property
tax
exemption
for
certain
26


property
of
an
organization
composed
of
veterans.
The
bill
27


strikes
the
requirement
that
the
exemption
is
limited
only
to
28


those
organizations
wholly
composed
of
veterans
of
any
war
and
29


instead
allows
the
exemption
for
organizations
composed
of
30


veterans.
