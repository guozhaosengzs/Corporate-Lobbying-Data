CHAPTER
717B
OFFENSES.
The
bill
amends
three
offenses
which
3


are
part
of
Code
chapter
717B.
These
include
animal
abuse
4


(Code
section
717B.2),
animal
neglect
(Code
section
717B.3),
5


and
animal
torture
(Code
section
717B.3A).
The
bill
creates
6


two
new
criminal
offenses
in
Code
chapter
717B
including
7


animal
abandonment
(new
Code
section
717B.3B)
and
animal
8


endangerment
(new
Code
section
717B.3C).
It
also
refers
to
two
9


other
offenses
provided
in
the
Code
chapter
which
include
the
10


abandonment
of
a
cat
or
dog
which
is
repealed
(Code
section
11


717B.8)
and
injury
or
interference
with
a
police
service
dog
12


which
has
not
been
amended
(Code
section
717B.9).
All
of
13


these
offenses
are
classified
as
animal
mistreatment.
Each
14


of
the
offenses
other
than
interfering
with
a
police
service
15


dog
includes
an
enhanced
penalty
that
applies
to
a
convicted
16


person
who
has
previously
committed
any
of
the
named
offenses
17


classified
as
animal
mistreatment;
or
committed
a
non-Code
18


chapter
offense
including
bestiality
(Code
section
717C.1)
or
19


an
offense
involving
an
animal
contest
(Code
section
717D.4).
20


TYPES
OF
PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
ABUSE.
Animal
abuse
involves
21


intentionally
injuring
an
animal
by
violence
or
poisoning.
22


The
bill
expands
the
intent
element
by
adding
acting
either
23


knowingly
or
recklessly.
It
removes
a
provision
that
exempts
24


a
person
who
acts
with
the
consent
of
the
animal’s
owner.
It
25


adds
a
provision
exempting
a
commercial
establishment
engaged
26


in
the
breeding
or
transfer
of
nonagricultural
animals,
27


so
long
as
the
commercial
establishment’s
conduct
complies
28


with
applicable
standard
of
care
requirements
(Code
section
29


162.10A).
The
bill
reduces
the
penalty
from
an
aggravated
to
a
30


serious
misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
does
not
31


cause
an
animal
serious
injury
or
death
and
retains
the
penalty
32


of
aggravated
misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
33


causes
an
animal
serious
injury
or
death.
It
provides
that
the
34


aggravated
misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony

if
the
person
was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
1


offenses
classified
as
animal
mistreatment.
2


TYPES
OF
OFFENSES
——
NEGLECT.
Animal
neglect
involves
3


failing
to
provide
an
animal
with
adequate
food,
water,
or
4


shelter,
or
torturing
the
animal.
The
bill
rewrites
these
5


requirements
by
requiring
that
an
animal
be
furnished
with
6


adequate
supplies
of
nutritional
food,
access
to
potable
water,
7


adequate
sanitary
conditions,
ventilated
shelter
sufficient
8


to
provide
the
animal
with
protection
from
extreme
weather
9


conditions,
and
necessary
veterinary
care.
The
bill
eliminates
10


the
torture
prohibition.
It
retains
the
criminal
penalty
which
11


is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
However,
the
penalty
is
increased
to
12


a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
animal
suffers
an
injury
and
to
an
13


aggravated
misdemeanor
if
the
animal
suffers
a
serious
injury
14


or
death.
In
a
case
where
the
animal
suffers
a
serious
injury
15


or
death,
the
aggravated
misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a
class
16


“D”
felony
if
the
person
was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
17


named
offenses.
18


TYPES
OF
OFFENSES
——
TORTURE.
Animal
torture
involves
19


inflicting
upon
an
animal
severe
physical
pain
with
depraved
20


or
sadistic
intent
to
cause
prolonged
suffering
or
death.
The
21


bill
requires
that
the
act
constitute
an
intentional,
knowing,
22


or
reckless
infliction
of
prolonged
or
repeated
physical
pain
23


that
results
in
suffering
and
serious
injury
or
death.
It
adds
24


a
provision
exempting
a
commercial
establishment
engaged
in
the
25


breeding
or
transfer
of
nonagricultural
animals,
so
long
as
the
26


commercial
establishment’s
conduct
complies
with
applicable
27


standard
of
care
requirements
(Code
section
162.10A).
It
28


replaces
the
current
penalties
for
animal
torture.
A
person
29


is
no
longer
guilty
of
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
for
the
first
30


offense
and
a
class
“D”
felony
for
a
subsequent
offense.
31


Instead,
a
person
is
guilty
of
a
class
“D”
felony,
which
is
32


enhanced
to
a
class
“C”
felony
if
the
person
was
previously
33


convicted
of
one
of
the
named
offenses.
It
also
eliminates


34


a
requirement
that
a

convicted
of
animal
torture
must
