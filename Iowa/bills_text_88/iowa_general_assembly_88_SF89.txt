with

charitable

An

also

an

An

defined
in
the
32


bill
to
include
an
Iowa
nonprofit,

at
least
51
percent
of
its

activities
in
Iowa
counties
with
a
population
of
fewer
than
2


50,000
as
determined
by
the
most
recent
federal
decennial
3


census.

An
organization
must
apply
to
EDA
to
be
certified
as
an
5


eligible
housing
developer
or
an
eligible
rural
housing
6


developer.
A
certification
by
EDA
will
last
for
a
period
of
7


three
years,
at
which
time
an
eligible
housing
developer
or
8


eligible
rural
housing
developer
may
apply
to
be
recertified.
9


Failure
to
meet
the
requirements
specified
above
may
cause
the
10


organization
to
lose
its
certification
as
an
eligible
housing
11


developer
or
eligible
rural
housing
developer,
but
the
loss
12


of
such
certification
does
not
prohibit
an
organization
from
13


subsequently
reapplying
to
EDA
for
certification.
14


In
order
to
receive
a
tax
credit
for
a
charitable
15


contribution
to
an
eligible
housing
developer
or
eligible
rural
16


housing
developer,
a
taxpayer
is
required
to
apply
to
the
17


developer
in
the
manner
and
form
prescribed
by
EDA
on
or
after
18


the
date
the
charitable
contribution
is
made.
The
developer
is
19


then
required
to
forward
the
application
to
EDA.
20


The
tax
credit
equals
50
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
cash

21


noncash
charitable
contribution
made
to
the
eligible
housing
22


developer
or
eligible
rural
housing
developer
during
the
tax
23


year.
The
minimum
amount
of
charitable
contribution
that
may
24


qualify
for
the
tax
credit
is
$500,
but
each
eligible
housing
25


developer
or
eligible
rural
housing
developer
is
allowed
to
26


set
a
higher
minimum
contribution
amount.
The
bill
provides
27


that
EDA
shall
not
issue
more
than
$7
million
in
tax
credits
28


per
calendar
year.
Of
that
$7
million
maximum
aggregate
29


amount,
20
percent
($1.4
million)
of
the
tax
credits
shall
30


be
reserved
for
charitable
contributions
to
eligible
rural
31


housing
developers.
The
maximum
amount
of
tax
credits
that
32


may
be
issued
per
taxpayer
for
charitable

in
a
33


tax
year
is
$250,000,
or
$300,000
if

during
the
tax
year
were

one

The
tax
credit
may
be
claimed
against
the
individual

tax,
the
corporate
income
tax,
the

tax,
the

and

To
claim
a
tax
5


credit,
a
taxpayer
must
include
a
tax
credit
certificate
with
6


the
taxpayer’s
tax
return.
The
tax
credit
is
nonrefundable
7


and
nontransferable,
but
any
excess
may
be
carried
forward
for
8


five
tax
years.
The
amount
of
the
charitable
contribution
for
9


which
the
tax
credit
is
claimed
shall
not
be
deductible
in

determining

purposes.
11


EDA
is
required
to
issue
tax
credits
on
a
first-come,
12


first-served
basis
until
the
maximum
amount
of
$7
million
13


per
calendar
year
is
reached.
If
the
amount
of
tax
credit
14


applications
exceeds
$7
million
in
a
calendar
year,
EDA
15


is
required
to
establish
a
wait
list
and
give
priority
in
16


subsequent
years
to
applications
on
the
wait
list.
17


The
bill
requires
EDA
and
the
department
of
revenue
to
18


adopt
rules
as
necessary
for
the
implementation
of
the
bill,
19


and
requires

to
20


the
governor
and
general
assembly
containing
information
as
21


described
in
the

The

applies
to

years
beginning

2019,
and
to
