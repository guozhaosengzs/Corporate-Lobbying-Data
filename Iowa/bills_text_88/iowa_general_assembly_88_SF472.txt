for

at

meetings
of
the
board
prior
to
the
25


meeting
at
which
it
is
to
be

approved
by
a

26


of
the

requirements

28


the

by
the
board.
The
bill
limits
the
30


county
to
imposing
either
the
income
surtax
or
the
property
31


tax
following
adoption
of
the
required
resolution.
The
bill
32


specifies
that
a
tax
under
Code
chapter
422D
may
be
imposed
for
33


a
period
not
to
exceed
five
consecutive
years
after
adoption
34


of
the
resolution
and

period
of
time
for

of
a

to

imposes

that

county
of
$1
per
$1,000
of
assessed
value
of
4


taxable
property
in
the
county.
5


The
bill
strikes
a
limitation
on
the
type
of
governmental
6


entity
that
a
county
may
enter
into
agreements
with
in
order
to
7


ensure
adequate
coverage
of
the
county’s
service
area.

The
bill
does
not
affect
the
imposition
and
collection
of

taxes
under
Code
chapter
422D
in
effect
on

such
