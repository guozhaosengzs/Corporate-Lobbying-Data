NEW
CODE
SECTION
216.6B.
The
bill
creates
new
Code
section
24


216.6B
(additional
unfair
or
discriminatory
practice
——
sexual
25


harassment
in
employment)
in
the
Iowa
civil
rights
Act.
The
26


bill
defines
sexual
harassment
similarly
to
Code
chapter
19B.
27


The
bill
requires
that
every
employer
adopt
a
written
policy
28


against
sexual
harassment
and
prescribes
what
the
policy
29


must
include.
The
bill
requires
that
the
employer
post
the
30


policy
in
a
prominent
and
accessible
location
in
the
workplace
31


and
provide
an
individual
written
copy
of
the
policy
to
all
32


employees.
The
bill
requires
that
employers
provide
copies
33


of

written
policies

upon
hire
and
provides
34


written
copies

These
provisions
of
the
bill
are
not
effective
until
1


the
Iowa
civil
rights
commission
(commission)
prepares
and
2


provides
to
employers
a
model
policy
and
model
poster
regarding
3


sexual
harassment,
which
is
a
requirement
of
the
bill.
4


The
bill
provides
that
an
assertion
that
an
individual
did
5


not
receive
the
information
required
to
be
provided
by
the
bill
6


shall
not
result
in
the
automatic
liability
of
any
employer
7


to
any
current
or
former
employee
or
applicant
in
any
action
8


alleging
sexual
harassment.
The
bill
further
provides
that
9


an
employer’s
compliance
with
the
notice
requirements
of
the
10


bill
does
not
preclude
the
employer
from
liability
for
sexual
11


harassment
of
any
current
or
former
employee
or
applicant.
12


The
bill
encourages
employers
and
labor
organizations
to
13


conduct
annual
education
and
training
programs
on
the
topic
of
14


sexual
harassment.
15


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
shall
not
require
any
16


employee
or
prospective
employee,
as
a
condition
of
employment,
17


to
sign
an
agreement
or
waiver
that
does
any
of
the
following:
18


(1)
prohibits,
prevents,
or
otherwise
restricts
the
employee
or
19


prospective
employee
from
opposing,
disclosing,
reporting,
or
20


participating
in
an
investigation
of
sexual
harassment,
or
(2)
21


except
as
otherwise
permitted
by
state
or
federal
law,
purports
22


to
waive
a
substantive
or
procedural
right
to
remedy
available
23


to
the
employee
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
sexual
harassment.
24


The
bill
sets
forth
what
an
agreement
to
settle
a
sexual
25


harassment
claim
shall
state,
including
that
it
does
not
26


waive
any
rights
or
claims
that
may
arise
after
the
date
the
27


settlement
agreement
is
executed
and
that
it
does
not
prohibit,
28


prevent,
or
otherwise
restrict
the
individual
who
made
the
29


claim
from
exercising
enumerated
rights.
The
bill
provides
30


that
an
agreement
to
settle
a
sexual
harassment
claim
that
31


violates
such
provisions
is
void
and
unenforceable
against
the
32


person
who
made
the
claim.

The

and
the

the

available

The
bill
14


provides
that
following
such
an
inspection
and
examination,
15


the
commission
shall
notify
the
employer
of
the
results
16


of
the
inspection
and
examination,
including
any
issues
or
17


deficiencies
identified,
provide
resources
regarding
practices
18


and
procedures
for
the
prevention
of
sexual
harassment
that
19


the
employer
may
wish
to
adopt
or
utilize,
and
identify
20


any
technical
assistance
that
the
commission
may
be
able
to
21


provide
to
help
the
employer
address
any
identified
issues
22


or
deficiencies.
The
bill
provides
that
if
the
commission
23


determines
that
it
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
employer’s
24


workplace
is
free
from
sexual
harassment,
the
employer
may
be
25


required,
for
a
period
of
up
to
three
years,
to
provide
an
26


annual

that

certain

set
forth
in
the
bill
to
all
employees

conduct
an
annual,
anonymous
working-climate

The

provides
