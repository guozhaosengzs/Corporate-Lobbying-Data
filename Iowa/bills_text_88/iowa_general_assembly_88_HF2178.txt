14


BACKGROUND.
Code
chapter
459
applies
to
operations
in
15


which
agricultural
animals
are
maintained
for
at
least
45
16


days
in
any
12-month
period
in
areas
which
are
totally
roofed
17


(Code
section
459.102).
The
Code
chapter
is
divided
into
a
18


number
of
subchapters
including
subchapter
II
which
regulates
19


air
quality
and
imposes
separation
distances
benefiting
20


certain
objects
or
locations
including
residences,
commercial
21


enterprises,
religious
institutions,
educational
institutions,
22


and
public
use
areas
(Code
section
459.202);
and
subchapter
23


III
which
regulates
water
quality
including
by
requiring
24


certain
persons
to
file
MMPs
with
the
DNR,
including
owners
of
25


operations
and
persons
applying
manure
on
land
(Code
section
26


459.312).
Generally,
an
operation
must
retain
manure
that
27


is
produced
at
the
location
until
the
manure
is
transported
28


and
used
according
to
water
quality
requirements
(e.g.,
via
29


application
on
farmland)
(see
Code
section
459.311).
Liquid
30


manure
is
animal
excreta
or
other
commonly
associated
wastes
of
31


animals
that
flows
perceptibly
under
pressure,
is
capable
of
32


being
transported
through
a
pumping
device,
and
is
composed
on
33


molecules
flowing
freely
under
stress
(Code
section
459.102).
34


An
MMP
refers
to
both
an
original
document
and
a
document
which
35

updates
the
original
plan.
An
updated
plan
must
be
submitted
1


to
DNR
on
an
annual
basis
(Code
section
459.312).

APPLICABLE
CIVIL
PENALTIES.
Code
section
459.602
provides
3


for
civil
penalties
that
may
be
assessed
for
violations
of
4


air
quality
requirements
under
Code
chapter
459,
subchapter
5


II.
A
violator
is
subject
to
Code
section
455B.109,
which
6


provides
for
the
administrative
assessment
of
civil
penalties
7


of
up
to
$10,000.
Code
section
459.603
provides
for
civil
8

that
may
be
