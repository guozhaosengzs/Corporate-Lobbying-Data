shall
review

proceeding.
Upon

determining
that
errors
did
not
occur
at
the
trial
requiring
18


reversal
or
modification
of
the
judgment,
the
supreme
court
19


shall
proceed

imposed.
In
its
review
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
21


supreme
court
shall
determine
all
of
the
following:

Whether
the

of
death
was
imposed
capriciously
or
23


under
the
influence
of
prejudice
or
other
arbitrary
factor.
24


b.
Whether
the
special
verdicts
returned
under
section

are
supported
by
the
evidence.
26


c.
Whether
the
sentence
of
death
is
excessive
or


27


disproportionate
to
the
penalty
imposed
in
similar
cases,
28


considering
both
the
crime
and
the
defendant.

If
the
supreme
court
determines
that
the
sentence
of
30


death
was
not
lawfully
imposed,
the

shall
set
31


aside
the
sentence
and
shall
remand
the

to

for
a

to
provide
for
19


punishment
by
death
for
capital
murder
committed
by
a
person
20


age
18
or
older
if
the
trial
jury,
or
the
judge
if
there
21


is
no
jury,
makes
specific
findings
and
whether
the
jury
22


believes
the
defendant
should
be
put
to
death
in
a
separate
23


penalty
proceeding
held
after
the
close
of
the
initial
trial
24


proceeding.
25


Under
the
bill,
a
death
penalty
sentence
could
be
imposed
26


if
the
person
is
convicted
of
the
multiple
offenses
of
murder
27


in
the
first
degree,
kidnapping
in
the
first,
second,
or

28


degree,
and

the
first,
second,
or
third
degree
29


with
respect
to
the
same
victim,
and
the
victim
is
a
minor.
30


The
bill
provides
that
in
order
to
receive
a
sentence
of
31


death,
the
defendant

shown
a
manifest
indifference
to
human
life.
1


If
a
person
is
indigent
and
is
charged
with
capital
murder,
2


payment
of
costs
for
two
attorneys
is
authorized.
The
supreme
3


court
is
required
to
establish
standards
for
the
competency
4


of
counsel
in
death
penalty
cases.
The
state
public
defender
5


is
charged
with
establishing
teams
of
qualified
lead
and
6


co-counsel
for
death
penalty
cases,
as
well
as
conducting
7


or
sponsoring
specialized
training
programs
for
attorneys
8


representing
persons
who
may
be
executed.
9


If
a
capital
murder
case
proceeds
to
trial
and
a
notice
of
10


intent
to
seek
the
death
penalty
has
been
filed,
in
addition
to
11


any
other
defenses
which
may
be
presented
to
the
charge,
the
12


defendant
may
raise
the
issue
of
intellectual
disability
or
13


mental
illness
during
the
time
of
filing
pretrial
motions.
14


Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
15


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
16


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the
17


race,
color,
religious
beliefs,
national
origin,
sex,
or
other
18


protected
classes
under
Code
chapter
216
of
the
defendant
or
19


of
any
victim
is
not
to
be
considered.
The
supreme
court
20


shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
death
sentences
21


imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
imposed
under
the
22


influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
available
to
23


litigants.
24


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
25


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
26


a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
27


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
28


a
reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances
29


that
may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
30


sentenced
to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
31


consider
include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
32


influence
of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
33


age
of
the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
34


the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
35


-15-

S.F.
296


not
to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
1


no
significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
2


under
extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
3


the
murder;
and
the
defendant’s
character
or
record
or
the
4


circumstances
of
the
offense.
The
sentencing
proceeding
is
5


conducted
separately
from
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
6


the
same
trier
of
fact.
7


For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
8


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
9


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
10


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
11


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
12


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.
Evidence
of
certain
13


juvenile
delinquency
adjudications
is
not
admissible
in
any
14


proceeding
to
determine
the
sentence.
If
the
jury
fails
to
15


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
16


penalty
imposed
would
be
life
imprisonment.
17


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
18


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
19


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
20


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
21


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
22


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
23


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
24


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the
supreme
25


court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
26


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
27


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
28


witnessing
of
executions.
29


A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
30


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
31


the
person
is
no
longer
pregnant.
A
procedure
is
also
provided
32


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane
33


after
conviction
but
before
execution.


34


An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or

in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
1


for
refusing
to
participate.
2


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
3


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
4


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
5


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
6


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
7


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
8


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
9


The
bill
contains
severability
provisions
and
takes
effect
10


January
1,
2020,
and
applies
only
to
offenses
committed
on
or
11


after
that
date.
