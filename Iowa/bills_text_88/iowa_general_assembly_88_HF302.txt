(2)
Whether
the
rule
filing
would
be
simple

administer
1


in
terms
of
both
enforcement
by
the
agency
and
compliance
by
2


any
regulated
persons.

b.
The
degree
to
which
the
rule
filing
or
related
rules
4


or

procedures
include
performance
measures
that
are
5


directly
related
to
the
desired
outcome,
including
but
not
6


limited
to
a
provision
establishing
periodic
review
to
ensure
7


intended
outcomes
or
a
provision
providing
for
the
rescission
8


of
the

achieve
the
desired
10


original
outcomes.

22


to
achieve
the
desired
outcome

to
what
extent
the
benefits
23


of
the
rule
filing
are
greater
than
the
burdens
it
imposes.
24


e.

determination
that
the
rule
filing
does
not
have
25


a
detrimental
effect

This

the
adoption
of
rules
3


by
executive
branch
agencies
under
Code
chapter
17A,
the
Iowa
4


administrative
procedure
Act.
5


The
bill
provides
that
a
rule
filing
that
would
add
one
6


or
more
regulations
to
the
Iowa
administrative
code
shall
7


also
rescind
a
number
of
regulations
equal
to
at
least
twice
8


the

added.
The
bill
specifies
that
if
9


a
regulation
is
rescinded
and
adopted
anew
in
the
same
rule
10


filing,
the
rescission
of
the
prior
rule
shall
count
as
one
of
11


the
two
required
rescissions.
This
requirement
does
not
apply
12


to
rule
filings
by
an
agency
within
78
weeks
of
the
effective
13


date
of
the
statute
that
established
the
agency.
14


The
bill
defines
“regulation”

bulletin,
not
including
a

subrule
or
other
subunit
or
an
entry
designated
in
the
Iowa
17


administrative
code
as
reserved

The
bill
defines
18


“rule
filing”
as
a
notice
of
intended
action,
a
rule
filed
19


without
notice,
or
an
adopted
rule.
20


The
bill
requires
that
an
agency,
before
submitting
a
21


rule
filing
to
the
administrative
rules
coordinator
and
the
22


administrative
code
editor
as
required
under
current
law,
23


to
submit
the
rule
filing
to
the
department
of
management
24


for

The
bill
requires
that
the
department
ensure
25


compliance
with
the
requirement
to
rescind
a
number
of
26


regulations
equal
to
at
least
twice
the

in
a
rule
filing
is
not
accomplished
solely
by
28


reorganizing

The
bill
29


authorizes
the

to
circumvent
the
requirement.
31


The

requires
an
agency
to
include
a
regulatory

submission.
The

the

applicable
section
of
the
statute
that
provides
specific
legal
1


authority
for
the
agency
to
adopt
the

filing,
the
purpose

of
the

and,
if

the

the

in
consultation
with
the

criteria
relate
to
effectiveness

necessity,
performance
12


measures,
clear
justifications,
cost
effectiveness,
economic
13


impact,
and
whether
the
regulations
are

of
law.
15


If
the
department
approves
a
rule
filing,

a

equal
to
at
least
twice
the

added
in

rule
filing,
the
requirement
for
25


an
evaluation
of
the
rule
filing
by

26


The
request
shall
include
a
detailed
justification
for
the

protect
