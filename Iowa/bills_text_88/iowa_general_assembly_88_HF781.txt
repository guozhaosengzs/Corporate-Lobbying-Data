OVERVIEW.
This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
under
Title
11


V,
subtitle
4,
of
the
Code
regulating
persons
operating
under
12


licenses
issued
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
13


stewardship
(DALS).
The
bill
creates
Code
chapter
204
and
14


authorizes
the
production
of
hemp
under
the
DALS’
regulatory
15


supervision
when
acting
under
the
provisions
of
the
Agriculture
16


Improvement
Act
of
2018,
Pub.
L.
No.
115-334
(2018
Farm
Bill).
17


The
2018
Farm
Bill
defines
hemp
as
a
species
of
Cannabis
having
18


a
maximum
concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
19


that
does
not
exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent.
The
2018
Farm
20


Bill
authorizes
states
to
assume
primary
regulatory
authority
21


over
the
production
of
hemp
by
submitting
a
state
plan
(plan)
22


for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
23


(USDA)
which
has
60
days
to
approve,
disapprove,
or
amend
the
24


plan.
The
2018
Farm
Bill
provides
that
state
regulations
may
25


be
more
but
not
less
stringent
than
the
federal
regulations.
26


The
provisions
of
the
bill
are
also
enforced
by
the
department
27


of
public
safety
(DPS)
which
is
designated
as
the
chief
28


criminal
enforcement
agency
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
29


(local
law
enforcement).
The
bill
also
provides
for
the
30


regulation
of
hemp
products
which
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
31


other
federal
agencies.
32


HEMP
LICENSES
AND
FEES.
DALS
is
required
to
accept
and
33


approve
or
disapprove
applications
for
the
issuance
of
a
hemp
34


license
(license)
on
a
one-year
basis
subject
to
renewal.

license
covers
a
crop
site
which
cannot
exceed
40
contiguous
1


acres.
DALS
may
issue
any
number
of
licenses
to
a
single
2


applicant.
However,
a
person
is
prohibited
from
holding
more
3


than
40
crop
sites
under
all
current
licenses
issued
to
the
4


person.
DALS
must
assess
and
collect
hemp
fees
(fees)
for
the
5


issuance
of
a
license
and
for
an
annual
fall
inspection
until
6


June
30,
2022.
After
that
date,
fees
are
to
be
established
by
7


rule
based
on
the
amount
required
to
administer
and
enforce
the
8


provisions
of
the
bill.
Moneys
collected
from
the
fees
are
to
9


be
deposited
into
a
hemp
fund
(fund)
which
are
appropriated
10


to
DALS
for
purposes
of
administering
and
enforcing
these
11


provisions.
12


REGULATIONS.
DALS
is
required
to
adopt
rules
regulating
13


the
production
of
hemp,
and
may
adopt
rules
as
necessary
or
14


desirable
to
administer
and
enforce
the
Code
chapter.
The
15


bill
allows
a
person
to
engage
in
the
retail
sale
of
hemp
16


products;
the
addition
of
a
hemp
derivative
