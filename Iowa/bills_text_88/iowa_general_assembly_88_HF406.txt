EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
requires
a
water
quality
plan
to
be
executed
by
10


a
person
as
a
condition
to
receiving
financial
assistance
for
11


establishing
a
soil
and
water
conservation
practice.
The
plan
12


would
cover
water
quality
practices
such
as
land
use
changes
13


or
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
a
measure
that
limits
14


sediment
or
nutrients
from
being
conveyed
by
surface
water
15


runoff
or
leaching.
It
would
also
cover
farming
practices
16


regarding
crop
production,
including
those
associated
with
17


tillage.
A
water
quality
plan
must
be
executed
by
the
owner
18


of
agricultural
land
or
an
operator
managing
the
farming
19


activities
occurring
on
the
agricultural
land.
The
plan
is
20


to
develop
in
cooperation
with
the
commissioners
of
the
soil
21


and
water
conservation
district
where
the
agricultural
land
is
22


located.
However,
a
plan
is
not
required
to
be
filed
until
23


December
31,
2021.
The
plan
must
be
based
on
a
crop
field
water
24


quality
model
required
to
be
developed
by
the
Iowa
nutrient
25


research
center
with
the
objective
that
the
contribution
of
26


nonpoint
sources
of
nutrients
occurring
on
agricultural
land
27


must
be
reduced
by
41
percent
for
nitrogen
and
29
percent
for
28


phosphorus.
The
commissioners
must
conduct
