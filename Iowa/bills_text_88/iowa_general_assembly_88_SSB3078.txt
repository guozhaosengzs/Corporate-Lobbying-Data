of

The
bill
allows
a
person
who
has
a
1


secured
interest
attached
to
farm
products
to
complete
and
file
2


a
document
referred
to

or
a
statement
amending,
continuing,
or
terminating
the
4


effective
financing
statement,
with
the
secretary
of

(secretary).
The
secretary
must
compile
information
contained
6


in
the
effective
financing
statements
into
a
master
list
7


organized
according
to
farm
products
which
the
secretary
must
8


regularly
distribute
to
buyers
of
farm
products
registered

9


the
secretary.
The
secretary
may
also
respond
to
verbal

written
inquiries
by
buyers
including
unregistered
buyers
and
11


deliver
a
written
confirmation
to
inquiring
buyers
regarding
12


whether
a
farm
product
is
subject
to
a
security
interest.
If
13


a
buyer
registers
with
the
secretary
prior
to
the
purchase
14


of
farm
products,
the
registered
buyer
takes
subject
to
the
15


security
interest
only
if
the
secured
party
has
filed
an
16


effective
financing
statement
that
covers
the
farm
products
17


being
sold,
unless
the
registered
buyer
secures
a
release
of
18


the
security
interest.
If
a
buyer
fails
to
register
with
the
19


secretary,
the
buyer
takes
subject
to
the
security
interest
20


only
if
the
secured
party
has
filed
an
effective
financing
21


statement
that
covers
the
farm
products,
and
the
buyer
could
22


have
discovered
the
existence
of
the
effective
financing
23


statement
by
conducting
an
inquiry
and
receiving
a
response
and
24


confirmation.
The
bill
authorizes
the
secretary
to
establish
25


fees
for
secured
parties
filing
effective
financing
statements
26


and
buyers
registering
with
the
secretary.
The
secretary
27


must
adopt
rules
as
necessary
to
implement
and
administer
the
28


provisions
of
the
system.
The
system
becomes
effective
90
days
29


after
the
publication
date
of
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
30


that
includes
a
statement
by

verifying
that
(1)
31


the

BACKGROUND.
Article

of
the
UCC
provides
an
exception
for
35


-11-

da/jh

S.F.
_____


buyers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
who
generally
take
1


free
of
a
security
interest
created
by
the
seller
even
in
cases
2


in
which
the
security
interest
has
been
perfected
and
the
buyer
3


is
aware
of
its
existence
(Code
section
554.9320).
However,
4


notwithstanding
this
exception,
a
buyer
who
purchases
a
farm
5


product
from
a
person
engaged
in
farming
operations
may
not
6


take
free
of
a
security
interest.
The
federal
Food
Security
7


Act
of
1985,
in
relevant
part
(7
U.S.C.
§1631),
preempts
the
8


state’s
article
9
requirements
by
providing
that
a
buyer
in
9


the
ordinary
course
of
business,
a
commission
merchant,
or
a
10


selling
agent
(all
classified
under
the
term
“buyer”)
may
buy
11


farm
products
without
being
subject
to
a
security
interest
12


created
by
the
seller
but
only
if
the
buyer
does
not
have
13


actual
or
constructive
notice
of
that
security
interest.
The
14


federal
law
allows
states
to
elect
between
two
notification
15


options:
(1)
Iowa’s
current
law
requiring
the
secured
party
to
16


deliver
direct
notice
to
potential
buyers
of
a
secured
party’s
17


interest
in
the
farm
products
within
one
year
prior
to
sale,
18


or
(2)
the
system
described
in
the
bill.
In
either
case,
the
19


federal
law
does
not
supersede
article
9
requirements
that
20


establish
priorities
among
creditors.
