EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


This
bill
creates
an
administrative
system
to
regulate
14


objectionable
odors.
The
bill
places
responsibility
for
15


investigating
odor
complaints
and
enforcing
compliance
orders
16


with
the
department
of
public
health.
The
department
or
a
17


county
health
department
shall
respond
to
a
complaint
and
18


use
a
scent-detecting
device
to
determine
whether
an
odor
19


is
objectionable.
After
the
department
or
a
county
health
20


department
determines
that
an
odor
is
objectionable,
the
21


department
may
issue
a
compliance
order.
A
person
may
appeal
22


the
issuance
of
a
compliance
order
to
the
state
board
of
23


health.
A
violation
of
the
terms
of
a
compliance
order
is
24


punishable
by
a
civil
penalty
of
$10,000
per
day
for
each
25


day
a
violation
occurs.
Enforcement
under
the
bill
does
not
26


preclude
a
person
from
proceeding
in
a
nuisance
action
for
the
27


objectionable
odor.
The
bill
requires
the
department
to
adopt
28


rules
to
administer
provisions
of
the
bill.
