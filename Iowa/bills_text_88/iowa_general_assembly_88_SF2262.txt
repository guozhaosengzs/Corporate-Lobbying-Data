the
purview
of
the
office
of
the
chief
information
13


officer,
the
empower
rural
Iowa
broadband
grant
fund,
and
14


certain
broadband
infrastructure
tax
exemptions.
15


The
bill
amends
the
definitions
of
“facilitate”,
“targeted
16


service
area”,
and
“underserved
area”
for
purposes
of
Code
17


chapter
8B.
18


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“facilitate”
to
mean
a
19


communication
service
provider’s
ability
to
provide
broadband
20


service
at
or
above
the
download
and
upload
speeds
specified
in
21


the
definition
of
“targeted
service
area”
or
in
Code
section
22


8B.11(5),
which
is
also
amended
under
the
bill,
as
described
in
23


more
detail
below.
24


Currently,
“targeted
service
area”
is
defined
to
mean
25


a
United
States
census
bureau
census
block
located
in
26


this
state,
including
any
crop
operation
located
within
27


the
census
block,
within
which
no
communications
service


28


provider
offers
or
facilitates
broadband
service
at
or
above
29


the
download
and
upload
speeds
identified
by
the
federal
30


communications
commission
pursuant
to
section
706
of
the
31


federal
Telecommunications
Act
of
1996,
as
amended.
To
this
32


definition,
the
bill
adds
as
an
alternative
any
geographic
33


area,
as
determined
by
the
office
of
the
chief
information
34


officer
by
rule,
that
is
materially
underserved
by
broadband

service
such
that
the
download
and
upload
speeds
identified
1


by
the
federal
communications
commission
pursuant
to
section
2


706
of
the
federal
Telecommunications
Act
of
1996,
as
3


amended,
of
the
broadband
service
in
the
geographic
area
are
4


not
meaningfully
available.
The
bill
grants
to
the
office
5


the
power
to
determine
what
constitutes
a
geographic
area
6


being
“materially
underserved”
and
broadband
service
being
7


“meaningfully
available”.
8


The
bill
modifies
the
definition
of
“underserved
area”
to
9


remove
language
related
to
broadband
service
being
offered
10


in
a
targeted
service
area.
As
a
result,
an
underserved
11


area
now
means
any
portion
of
a
targeted
service
area
within
12


which
no
communications
service
provider
facilitates
broadband
13


service
meeting
the
download
and
upload
speeds
specified
in
the
14


definition
of
targeted
service
area.
15


Currently,
the
office
is
to
determine
whether
a
16


communications
service
provider
offers
or
facilitates
broadband
17


service
at
the
proper
download
and
upload
speed
by
reference
18


to
broadband
availability
maps
or
data
sources
that
are
widely
19


accepted
for
accuracy
and
available
for
public
review
and
20


comment
and
that
are
identified
by
the
office
by
rule.
The
21


bill
changes
this
provision
in
several
ways.
First,
the
bill
22


deletes
reference
to
a
communications
service
provider
offering
23


broadband
service.
Second,
the
bill
removes
the
requirement
24


that
the
maps
or
data
sources
be
widely
accepted
for
accuracy
25


and
available
for
public
review
and
comment.
Third,
the
bill
26


requires
that
the
office’s
determinations
exclude
mobile
27


wireless
or
satellite
data,
capabilities,
and
delivery
mediums.
28


The
bill
changes
the
name
of
the
connecting
Iowa
farms,
29


schools,
and
communities
broadband
grant
fund
to
the
empower
30


rural
Iowa
broadband
grant
fund.
The
bill
also
modifies
how
31


moneys
in
the
empower
rural
Iowa
broadband
grant
fund
may
be
32


used.
The
bill
permits
the
office
to
use
moneys
in
the
fund
for
33


purposes
of
administering
and
operating
the
grant
program.
34


In
addition,
the
bill
establishes
that
moneys
in
the
fund
35

that
have
been
awarded
to
a
communications
service
provider
but
1


not
paid
shall
not
revert
but
shall
remain
available
to
the
2


office
for
purposes
of
administering
the
award.
This
provision
3


is
retroactively
applicable
to
July
1,
2015.
4


Currently,
Code
section
8B.11(3)
allows
the
office,
by
rule,
5


to
increase
the
minimum
download
and
upload
speeds
for
grant
6


eligibility
under
the
fund.
The
bill
deletes
this
provision,
7


which
prevents
the
office
from
increasing
the
minimum
download
8


and
upload
speeds
for
grant
eligibility.
9


The
bill
adds
to
the
factors
the
office
is
to
consider
10


when
determining
whether
to
award
grants
from
the
fund.
When
11


considering
the
applicant’s
total
proposed
budget,
in
addition
12


to
the
factors
currently
considered,
the
office
is
now
also
13


to
consider
whether
the
applicant
requested
from
the
office
14


an
amount
less
than
the
maximum
amount
the
office
could
award
15


pursuant
to
Code
section
8B.11(5).
16


The
office
is
currently
prohibited
from
awarding
a
grant
17


from
the
fund
that
exceeds
15
percent
of
the
communications
18


service
provider’s
project
cost.
The
bill
amends
this
19


provision
to
allow
for
an
award
of
up
to
35
percent
of
20


the
communications
service
provider’s
project
cost
for
21


projects
that
will
result
in
the
installation
of
broadband
22


infrastructure
that
will
facilitate
broadband
service
providing
23


a
minimum
download
speed
of
100
megabits
per
second
and
a
24


minimum
upload
speed
of
20
megabits
per
second.
The
bill
25


allows
for
an
award
of
up
to
15
percent
of
the
communications
26


service
provider’s
project
cost
for
projects
that
will
result
27


in
the
installation
of
broadband
infrastructure
that
will


28


facilitate
broadband
service
providing
a
minimum
download
speed
29


less
than
100
megabits
per
second
but
greater
than
or
equal
30


to
the
download
speed
specified
in
the
definition
of
targeted
31


service
area,
and
a
minimum
upload
speed
less
than
20
megabits
32


per
second
but
greater
than
or
equal
to
the
upload
speed
33


specified
in
the
definition
of
targeted
service
area.
34


The
bill
amends
Code
section
427.1(40)(b)
to
remove
35

reference
to
the
broadband
service
being
offered,
inserting
1


that
the
broadband
service
need
only
be
facilitated.
2


Currently,
Code
section
427.1(40)
provides
that
the
3


certification
from
the
office
that
the
installation
will
4


facilitate
broadband
service
at
or
above
the
download
and
5


upload
speeds
specified
in
the
definition
of
targeted
service
6


area
is
pursuant
to
Code
section
8B.10.
The
bill
strikes
the
7


reference
to
Code
section
8B.10.
8


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes
related
to
the
change
9


in

of
the
fund
from
the
connecting
Iowa

and

grant
fund
to

upon
