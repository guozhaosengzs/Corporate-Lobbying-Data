This
bill
relates
to
the
uniform
anatomical
gift
Act
by
1


prohibiting
a
hospital,
physician,
procurement
organization,
2


or
other
person
from
determining
the
ultimate
recipient
of
an
3


anatomical
gift
based
upon
a
potential
recipient’s
disability,
4


except
to
the
extent
that
the
disability
has
been
found
by
a
5


physician,
following
a
case-by-case
evaluation
of
the
potential
6


recipient,
to
be
medically
significant
to
the
provision
of
7


the
anatomical
gift.
The
prohibition
applies
to
each
part
of
8


the
anatomical
gift
process
and
provides
that
a
person
with
a
9


disability
shall
not
be
required
to
demonstrate
postoperative
10


independent
living
abilities
in
order
to
have
access
to
an
11


anatomical
gift
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
person
will
have
12


sufficient,
compensatory
support
and
assistance.
The
bill
13


provides
that
a
court
shall
accord
priority
on
its
calendar
14


and
handle
expeditiously
any
action
brought
to
seek
any
remedy
15


authorized
by
law
for
purposes
of
enforcing
compliance
with
16


the
bill.
The
bill
is
not
to
be
deemed
to
require
referrals
17


or
recommendations
for,
or
the
performance
of,
medically
18


inappropriate
transplants
of
a
part
(an
organ,
an
eye,
or
19


tissue
of
a
human
being).
The
bill
defines
“disability”
as
20


having
the
same
meaning
as
used
in
the
federal
Americans
with
21


Disabilities
Act
of
1990.
