and

of
conformance
with
the
original
purpose
of
the
19


legislation
that
enacted
the
tax
credit,
as
those
issues
20


pertain
to
taxation
in

For

the
review.
The
report
shall
contain
a
statement
of
the
27


policy
goals
of
the
tax

and
shall
attempt
to
calculate
a

on
investment”
means
the

if
any,
provided
to
the
32


state
by
a
tax
credit
after
analyzing
the

to
the
state

of
offering
that
34


particular
tax
credit.

report
may
include
