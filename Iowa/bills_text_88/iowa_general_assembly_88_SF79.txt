EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does

by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
20


This
bill

to
apprenticeship
training

The
bill
defines

distance
learning”
as
23


educational
instruction
and
content

to
participants
24


via
the
internet
in
a
live

regular
and
substantive
27


synchronous
interactions
between
all
participants

the
28


instructor.
It
is
distinguished
from
“online

is
defined

as
educational

content


30


delivered
to

learning
outside
of
a
classroom,
or
at
the
participant’s

convenience,
or
independent
of
an
instructor.
2


The
bill
allows
interactive
distance
learning
to
be
counted
3


toward
contact
hours
for
purposes
of
calculating
a
training
4


grant
award
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
15B.
“Contact
hours”
are
5


defined
in
the
bill
as
the
time
an
apprenticeship
instructor
6


spends
instructing
an
apprentice
in
person,
or
via
interactive
7


distant
learning.
In
the
case
of
a
lead
apprenticeship
sponsor

with
programs
totaling
100
or
more
total
instructional
hours,
9


“contact

amount
of
online
training
is
not
more
than
30
percent

of

total
instructional
hours.
12


Current
law
does
not
make
a
distinction
between
interactive
13


distance
learning
and
online
training,
nor
does
it
define
14


either
term.
15


The
bill
applies
to
training
grants
awarded
to
16


apprenticeship
sponsors
and
lead
apprenticeship
sponsors

is
defined
in
the
bill
as
