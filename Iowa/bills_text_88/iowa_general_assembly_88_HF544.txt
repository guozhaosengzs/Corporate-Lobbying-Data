598.19
Waiting
period
before
decree.
1


No
decree
dissolving
a
marriage
shall
be
granted
in
any
2


proceeding
before
ninety
days
shall
have
elapsed
from
the
3


day
the
original
notice
is
served,
or
from
the
last
day
4


of
publication
of
notice,
or
from
the
date
that
waiver
or
5


acceptance
of
original
notice
is
filed
or
until
after
any


6


court-ordered
conciliation
is
completed,
whichever
period
7


shall
be
longer.
However,
the
court
may
in
its
discretion,
on
8


written
motion
supported
by
affidavit
setting
forth
grounds
9


of
emergency
or
necessity
and
facts
which
satisfy
the
court
10


that
immediate
action
is
warranted
or
required
to
protect
the
11


substantive
rights
or
interests
of
any
party
or
person
who
12


might
be
affected
by
the
decree,
hold
a
hearing
and
grant
a
13


decree
dissolving
the
marriage
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
14


applicable
period,
provided
that
requirements
of
notice
have
15


been
complied
with.
In
such
case
the
grounds
of
emergency
or
16


necessity
and
the
facts
with
respect
thereto
shall
be
recited
17


in
the
decree
unless
otherwise
ordered
by
the
court.
The
18


court
may
enter
an
order
finding
the
respondent
in
default
and
19


waiving
any
court-ordered


conciliation
when
the
respondent
has
20


failed
to
file
an
appearance
within
the
time
set
forth
in
the
21


original
notice.

EXPLANATION
23


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
25


This
bill
provides
that
the
court,
on
its
own
motion,
may
26


require
the
parties
to
a
dissolution
of
marriage
participate
in
27


conciliation
efforts
for
a
period
of
60
days
or
less
following
28


the
issuance
of
an
order
setting
forth
the
conciliation
29


procedure
and
the
conciliator.
Current
law
requires
the
30


court
to
order
the
parties
to
participate
in
conciliation
31


upon
the
application
of
the
petitioner
in
the
petition
or
by
32


the
respondent
in
the
responsive
pleading
to
the
petition,
or
33


within
20
days
of
appointment
of
an
attorney.
The
bill
also
34


eliminates
the
specific
provisions
requiring
the
court
to
grant
35

a
waiver
of
mandatory
participation
in
conciliation
based
on
a
1


history
of
elder
abuse
or
domestic
abuse
since
participation
2


in
conciliation
is
no
longer
mandatory.
Instead,
the
bill
3


requires
that
the
court,
in
making
its
determination
whether
to
4


require
participation
in
conciliation
efforts,
shall
consider
5


all
relevant
factors
including
but
not
limited
to
whether
a
6


history
of
abuse
or
violence
exists.
