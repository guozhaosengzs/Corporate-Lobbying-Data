Tongue
tie,
or
ankyloglossia
(AG),
is
a
congenital
condition
7


in
which
an
abnormally
short
frenulum
restricts
the
tongue's
8


ability
to
function
properly.
Lip
tie
is
an
unusually
tight
9


labial
frenulum,
which
keeps
the
upper
lip
tethered
to
the
gum
10


line.
In
some
infants,
these
conditions
affect
breast-feeding
11


and
cause
other
related
issues.
