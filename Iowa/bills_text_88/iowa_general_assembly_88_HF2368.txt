5


branch
agencies
under
Code
chapter
17A,
the

The
bill
specifies
that
if

shall
count

the

This
requirement
does
not
apply
14


to
rule
filings
by
an
agency
within
78
weeks
of
the
effective
15


date
of
the
statute
that
established
the
agency.
16


The
bill
defines
“regulation”
as
a
rule
as
described
in
the
17


preface
to
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin,
not
including
a
18


subrule
or
other
subunit
or
an
entry
designated
in
the
Iowa
19


administrative
code
as
reserved

The
bill
defines
20


“rule
filing”
as
a
notice
of
intended
action,
a
rule
filed
21


without
notice,
or
an
adopted
rule.
22


The
bill
requires
that
an
agency,
before
submitting
a
23


rule
filing
to
the
administrative
rules
coordinator
and
the
24


administrative
code
editor
as
required
under
current
law,
25


to
submit
the
rule
filing
to
the
department
of
management
26


for

The
bill
requires

The
bill
requires
an
agency
to
include
a
regulatory
34


baseline
statement
with

H.F.

the
department
from
approving
a
rule
filing
that
does
not
1


include
such
a
statement.
The
statement
shall
include
the
2


applicable
portion
of
the
statute
that
provides
specific
legal
3


authority
for
the
agency
to
adopt
the
rule
filing,
the
purpose
4


of
the
rule
filing,
and,
if
the
rule
filing
would
add
one
or
5


more
regulations
to
the
Iowa
administrative
code,
a
list
of
6


the
regulations
to
be
added
as

rescinded
in

8


the
agency
may
include
a
request
for
exemption
as
provided
in
9


the
bill.
10


The
bill
provides
criteria
for
evaluation
of
rule
filings
by
11


the
department,
in
consultation
with
the
administrative
rules
12


coordinator,
in
determining
whether
to
provide
approval.
The
13


criteria
relate
to
effectiveness
and
necessity,
performance
14


measures,
clear
justifications,
cost
effectiveness,
economic
15


impact,
and
whether
the
regulations
are
specifically
required
16


by
a
provision
of
law.
17


If
the
department
approves
a
rule
filing,
the
agency
shall

If
the
department
does
not
approve
a
rule
filing,
the
21


department
shall
provide
the
agency
with
a
written
explanation
22


for
its
disapproval.
23


The
bill
provides
a
process
for
an
agency
to
request
an
24


exemption
from
the
department
from
the
requirement
to
rescind
25


a
number
of
regulations
equal
to
at
least
twice
the
number
26


of
regulations
added
in
a
rule
filing,
the
requirement
for
27


an
evaluation
of
the
rule
filing
by
the
department,
or
both.
28


The
request
shall
include
a
detailed
justification
for
the
29


exemption.
The
department
shall
only
grant
an
exemption
if
30


the
department
determines
that
the
exemption
is
necessary
to
