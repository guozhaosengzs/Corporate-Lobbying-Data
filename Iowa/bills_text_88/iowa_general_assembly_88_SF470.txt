1


and
the
government
body’s
use
of
such

may
negatively
2


affect
adjoining
agricultural

The
government
body’s
use
3


of
government-held
land
could
involve
interfering
with
the

The

may
commence
a
proceeding

a

8


of
supervisors.
The
county
board
of
supervisors
must
approve
9


the
appointment
of
five
commissioners
by
the
chief
judge
of
10


the
judicial
district
for

The
commissioners
must
11


inspect
the
land
held
by
both
parties
and
make
a
decision
which
12


may
include
an
order
requiring
the
government
body
to
grant
13


the
agricultural
landowner
access
to
the
agricultural
land
or
14


award
the
landowner
compensatory
damages.
The
decision
is
15


final
unless
appealed
to
the
district
court.
The
bill
provides
16


that
the
government
body
shall
pay
costs
of
the
proceeding,
17


including
the
agricultural

attorney

if
the
18


amount
of

70

damages
claimed
by
the
agricultural
landowner.
The
government
20


body
must
also
pay
the
costs
of
the
appeal,
including
attorney
21


fees
unless
the

at
trial
or
a
court
on
further
22


appeal
awards
the
same
or
a
lesser
amount
of
damages.
