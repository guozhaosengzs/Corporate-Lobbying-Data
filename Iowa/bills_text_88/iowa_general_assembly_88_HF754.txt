OVERVIEW.
This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
under
Title
2


V,
subtitle
4,
of
the
Code
regulating
persons
operating
under
3


licenses
issued
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
4


stewardship
(DALS).
The
bill
creates
Code
chapter
204
and
5


authorizes
the
production
of
hemp
under
the
DALS’
regulatory
6


supervision
when
acting
under
the
provisions
of
the
Agriculture
7


Improvement
Act
of
2018,
Pub.
L.
No.
115-334
(2018
Farm
Bill).
8


The
2018
Farm
Bill
defines
hemp
as
a
species
of
Cannabis
having
9


a
maximum
concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
10


that
does
not
exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent.
The
2018
Farm
11


Bill
authorizes
states
to
assume
primary
regulatory
authority
12


over
the
production
of
hemp
by
submitting
a
state
plan
(plan)
13


for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
14


(USDA)
which
has
60
days
to
approve,
disapprove,
or
amend
the
15


plan.
The
2018
Farm
Bill
provides
that
state
regulations
may
16


be
more
but
not
less
stringent
than
the
federal
regulations.
17


The
provisions
of
the
bill
are
also
enforced
by
the
department
18


of
public
safety
(DPS)
which
is
designated
as
the
chief
19


criminal
enforcement
agency
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
20


(local
law
enforcement).
21


HEMP
LICENSES
AND
FEES.
DALS
is
required
to
accept
and
22


approve
or
disapprove
applications
for
the
issuance
of
a
hemp
23


license
(license)
on
a
one-year
basis
subject
to
renewal.
A
24


license
covers
a
crop
site
which
cannot
exceed
40
contiguous
25


acres.
DALS
may
issue
any
number
of
licenses
to
a
single
26


applicant.
However,
a
person
is
prohibited
from
holding
more
27


than
40
crop
sites
under
all
current
licenses
issued
to
the
28


person.
DALS
must
assess
and
collect
hemp
fees
(fees)
for
the
29


issuance
of
a
license
and
for
an
annual
fall
inspection
until
30


June
30,
2022.
After
that
date,
fees
are
to
be
established
by
31


rule
based
on
the
amount
required
to
administer
and
enforce
the
32


provisions
of
the
bill.
Moneys
collected
from
the
fees
are
to
33


be
deposited
into
a
hemp
fund
(fund)
which
are
appropriated
34


to
DALS
for
purposes
of
administering
and
enforcing

REGULATIONS.
DALS
is
required

the
production
of
hemp,
and
may
adopt
rules
as
necessary
or
3


desirable
to
administer
and
enforce
the
Code
chapter.
The
bill
4


allows
a

in
the
retail
sale
of
hemp
products
5


produced
in
another
state;
the
addition

animal
consumption;
and
the
transport
of
hemp
product
8

The
bill
provides
that
under
certain
9


conditions,
a
person
is
not
subject
to
a
criminal
offense
10


for
producing,
possessing,
using,
harvesting,
manufacturing,
11


marketing,
transporting,
delivering,
or
distributing
hemp
12


produced
on
a
licensee’s
crop
site.
The
bill
requires
that
a
13


person
hold
a
certificate
of
crop
inspection
issued
by
DALS.
14


INSPECTIONS
AND
TESTS.
DALS
is
required
to
conduct
an
15


annual
inspection
of
a
licensee’s
crop
site
and
obtain
a
sample
16


of
plants
that
are
part
of
the
crop
in
order
to
conduct
an
17


official
test.
DPS
or
local
law
enforcement
may
also
conduct
18


an
inspection
of
the
crop
site
and
conduct
its
own
test.
The
19


bill
provides
that
DALS,
DPS,
and
local
law
enforcement
may
20


enter
on
a
crop
site
and
other
associated
places
in
order
to
21


conduct
an
inspection.
22


ENFORCEMENT
AND
PENALTIES.
DALS
may
suspend
or
revoke
a
23


hemp
license
for
a
number
of
causes,
including
for
a
violation
24


of
statute
or
rule.
DALS
may
order
the
disposal
of
a
crop
25


produced
on
a
licensee’s
crop
site
if
official
test
results
26


indicate
that
a
crop
does
not
qualify
as
hemp.
The
disposal,
27


including
the
crop’s
destruction,
must
be
at
the
licensee’s
28


expense.
A
person
who
violates
a
provision
of
the
bill
is
29


subject
to
a
civil
penalty
of
not
less
than
$500
and
not
30


more
than
$2,500.
DALS
or
the
attorney
general
may
apply
to
31


district
court
to
obtain
an
injunction
to
enforce
the
bill’s
32


provisions.
DALS
may
establish
a

certain
33


violations
committed

by
a
