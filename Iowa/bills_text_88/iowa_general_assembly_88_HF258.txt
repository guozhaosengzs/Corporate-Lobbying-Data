EXPLANATION
22


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
23


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
24


This
bill
relates
to
the
standard
of
judicial
review
when
a
25


state
action
burdens
a
person’s
exercise
of
religion.
26


Under
current
law,
a
court
is
not
required
to
apply
27


heightened
scrutiny
when
reviewing
a
law
that
burdens
a
28


person’s
exercise
of
religion
when
such
law
is
generally
29


applicable.
The
bill
provides
that
a
court
shall
apply
the
30


compelling
interest
test
set
forth
in
Sherbert
v.
Verner,
374
31


U.S.
398
(1963)
and
Wisconsin
v.
Yoder,
406
U.S.
205
(1972)
in
32


such
cases,
so
that
state
action
cannot
substantially
burden
a
33


person’s
exercise
of
religion
unless
it
is
demonstrated
that
34


applying
the
law
of
general
applicability
is
in
furtherance
of
35

a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
is
the
least
restrictive
1


means
of
furthering
that
interest.
The
bill
provides
that
a
2


person
whose
exercise
of
religion
has
been
burdened
by
state
3


action
may
assert
such
violation
as
a
claim
or
defense
in
a
4


judicial
or
administrative
proceeding.
5


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
the
department
of
corrections,
a
6


district
department
of
correctional
services,
a
county
jail,
or
7


other
detention
facility.

The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
