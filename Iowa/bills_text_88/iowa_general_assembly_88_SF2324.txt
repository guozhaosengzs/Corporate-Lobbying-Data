This
bill
changes
the
requirements
for
a
sex
offender
19


to
be
granted
a
modification
of
the
sex
offender
registry
20


requirements.
Under
current
law,
a
sex
offender
must
be
on
21


probation,
parole,
work
release,
special
sentence,
or
any
22


other
type
of
conditional
release
to
file
an
application
for
a
23


modification.
The
bill
allows
any
sex
offender
on
the
Iowa
sex
24


offender
registry
to
file
an
application
for
a
modification.
25


Under
current
law,
a
sex
offender
will
only
be
granted
a
26


modification
by
a
court
if
the
date
of
the
commencement
of
27


the
requirement
to
register
occurred
at
least
two
years
prior
28


to
the
filing
of
the
application
for
a
tier
I
offender
and
29


five
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
application
for
a
tier
30


II
or
III
offender.
The
bill
changes
these
requirements
and
31


provides
that
a
tier
I
offender
must
have
initially
registered
32


at
least
10
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
application,
33


except
for
a

offender
who
was

of
age

degree
under
certain
circumstances
pursuant
to
Code
section

709.4(1)(b)(3)(d),
who
must
have
initially
registered
at
least
2


five
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
application.
A
tier
II
or
3


tier
III
offender
must
have
initially
registered
at
least
25
4


years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
application.
5


Under
current
law,
a
risk
assessment
approved
by
the
6


department
of
corrections
must
be
completed
and
an
offender
7


must
be
classified
as
a
low
risk
to
reoffend
in
order
to
be
8


granted
a
modification.
The
bill
strikes
this
requirement
and
9


allows
a
court
to
grant
a
modification
if
the
offender
has
10


successfully
completed
any
period
of
probation,
parole,
special
11


sentence,
or
other
supervised
release
for
the
offense
requiring
12


registration.
13


The
bill
provides
that
a
tier
I
offender
must
not
have
14


been
convicted
of
any
criminal
offenses
other
than
simple
15


misdemeanor
violations
of
Code
chapter
321
or
local
traffic
16


ordinances
for
the
10-year
period
immediately
preceding
17


the
filing
of
the
application
in
order
to
be
granted
a
18


modification.
The
bill
provides
that
a
tier
II
or
tier
III
19


offender
must
not
have
been
convicted
of
any
criminal
offenses
20


other
than
simple
misdemeanor
violations
of
Code
chapter
321
21


or
local
traffic
ordinances
for
the
25-year
period
immediately
22


preceding
the
filing
of
the
application
and
must
have
been
23


initially
required
to
register
as
a
result
of
an
adjudication
24


for
a
sex
offense
in
juvenile
court
in
order
to
be
granted
a
25


modification.
26


The
bill
allows
a
court
to
reduce
the
period
in
which
a
sex
27


offender
is
required
to
register.
The
bill
strikes
current
law
28


allowing
a
sex
offender
to
be
granted
a
modification
if
the
29


offender
is
required
to
be
on
the
sex
offender
registry
as
a
30


result
of
an
adjudication
for
a
sex
offense,
the
offender
is
31


not
under
the
supervision
of
the
juvenile
court
or
a
judicial

district
judicial
department
of
correctional
services,
and
the

department
of
