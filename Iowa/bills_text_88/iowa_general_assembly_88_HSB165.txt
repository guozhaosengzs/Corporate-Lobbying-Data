approximately
25
percent
of
budgeted
expenditures
and
certain
14


transfers
for
that
budget
year
unless
a
decision
is
certified
15


by
the
state
appeal
board
ordering
a
reduction
in
the
ending
16


fund
balance
of
any
of
those
funds.
The
county
or
city,
17


as
applicable,
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
budgeted
18


balances
in
excess
of
25
percent
are
reasonably
likely
to
be
19


appropriated
for
the
explicitly
reserved
or
designated
specific
20


purpose.
21


The
bill
also
allows
for
additional
property
taxes
to
be
22


levied
in
certain
fiscal
years
for
those
counties
or
cities
23


that
have,
as
of
June
30,
2019,
reduced
their
actual
ending
24


fund
balance
to
less
than
25
percent
of
actual
expenditures.
25


Such
additional
property
tax
dollars
authorized
but
not
levied
26


may
be
carried
forward
as
unused
ending
fund
balance
taxing
27


authority
until
and
for
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2025.
28


However,
the
amount
carried
forward
shall
not
exceed
25
percent
29


of
the
maximum
amount
of
property
tax
dollars
available
in
the
30


current
fiscal
year.
The
amount
of
such
additional
property
31


taxes
levied
shall
not,
however,
be
included
in
the
computation
32


of
the
maximum
amount
of
property
tax
dollars
which
may
be
33


certified
and
levied
in
future
budget
years.
34


The
bill
also
