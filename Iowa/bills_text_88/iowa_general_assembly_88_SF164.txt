city
or
county
identified
by
the
city
or
county
where
work
1


opportunities
are
available
and
qualified
applicants
are
2


lacking.
The
bill
requires
a
city
or
county
to
petition
the
3


community
college
in
the
region
in
which
the
city
or
county
4


is
located
to
designate
such
a
job
category
as
a
high-demand
5


job.
For
each
tax
year
a
community
college
may
designate
up
to
6


10
job
categories
as
“high-demand
jobs”
in
the
region
of
the
7


community
college
based
upon
a
petition
from
a
city
or
county.
8


An
individual
may
elect
to
take
the
exemption
during
the
9


first
tax
year
the
individual
receives
wages
from
a
high-demand
10


job
designated
in
the
bill
or
in
the
second
tax
year
of
11


receiving
such
wages.
After
the
election
as
to
what
tax
year
12


to
begin
the
exemption,
the
bill
requires
the
individual
to
13


take
the
exemption
for
a
total
of
five
consecutive
tax
years
14


if
the
person
resides
in
a
small
city
or
small
county,
or
three
15


consecutive
tax
years
if
the
person
does
not
reside

a

city
or

The

defines

15,000
based
upon
the
most

of
the
10
least
populated
counties
in
this
state
based
21


upon
the
most
recent
federal
decennial

22


Generally,
the
bill
provides
that
high-demand
job
wages
are
23


to
be
included
in
income
to
the
extent
previously
exempted
24


under
any
of
the
following
circumstances:
the
individual
25


ceases
to
have
wages
from
a
high-demand
job
in
any
tax
year
26


during
the
consecutive
years
the
individual
is
required
to
work
27


in
a
high-demand
job;
or
the
individual
becomes
a
nonresident
28


of
this
state
within
three
or
five
years
of
first
taking
the
29


exemption,
as
applicable.
30


However,
if
an
individual
becomes
disabled
after
taking
31


the
exemption
and
does
not
work
in
a
high-demand
job
for
the
32


consecutive
years
as
required
by
the
bill,
the
individual
is
33


not
required
to
include
high-demand
job
wages
as
income
to
the
34


extent
previously
exempted.
