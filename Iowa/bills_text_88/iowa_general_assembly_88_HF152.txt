Take

Affect
rights

absence
of
a
violation
of
the
declaration,

authorize
the

enforce
a

to
which
the

not
a
party.

and
circumstances
presented,
any
of
the
following:
27


a.
The
unit
owners
association’s
legal
position
does
not

justify
taking
any
or
further
enforcement
action.
29


b.
The
covenant,
restriction,
or
rule
being
enforced
is,
or
30


is
likely
to
be
construed
as,
inconsistent
with
law.
31


c.
Despite
the
existence
of
a
violation,
the
violation
is
32


nonmaterial
and
does
not
justify
expenditure
of
the
unit
owners
33


association’s
resources.

d.
It
is

be
construed
to
provide
open

access
to
the
management
of
the
common
interest
community
for
3


the
unit
owners.
4


New
Code
chapter
499C
defines
“common
interest
community”
5


to
mean
real
estate
described
in
a
declaration
with
respect
6


to
which
a

ownership
of
a
7


unit,
is
obligated
to
pay
for
a
share
of

are
also
defined
to
be
common
interest
13


communities.
The
bill
specifies
that
a
common

not
include
a
covenant
that
requires
the
owners
15


of
separate
parcels
of
real

to
share
certain
costs
or
16


other

not
18


include
a
community
where
all

19


owner.
20


The
bill
does
not
allow

Code
21


chapter
499C
to
be
varied
by
agreement,

rights
conferred

not
be
waived.
23


The

Code
chapter
499C
applies
to
all
common

communities
25


established

The

5


requires
each

owners
association
to
have
an
executive

board.
A

must

The

provides
that
the

chapter
499C
relating
to
a

owners
association
preempt

The

The

23


board.
24


The
