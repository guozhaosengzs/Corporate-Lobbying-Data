EXPLANATION
7


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


This
joint
resolution
proposes
an
amendment
to
the
10


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
establishing
a
new
Article
11


that
relates
to
the
state
budget
by
creating
a
constitutionally
12


required
state
general
fund
expenditure
limitation.
13


The
expenditure
limitation
is
the
lesser
of
99
percent
14


of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
general
fund
for
15


the
following
fiscal
year
or
104
percent
of
the
net
revenue
16


estimate
for
the
general
fund
for
the
current
fiscal
year.
17


The
amendment
defines
“adjusted
revenue
estimate”
and
“net
18


revenue
estimate”
and
requires
that
the
estimates
be
determined
19


by
a
revenue
estimating
conference,
which
is
required
to
be
20


established
by
the
general
assembly
by
law.
The
amendment
21


requires
the
expenditure
limitation
to
be
used
by
the
governor
22


in
preparation
of
the
governor’s
budget
and
by
the
general
23


assembly
in
the
budget
process,
and
requires
the
governor
to
24


submit,
and
the
general
assembly
to
pass,
a
budget
that
does
25


not
exceed
the
expenditure
limitation.
The
amendment
prohibits
26


the
governor
from
approving
or
disapproving
of
appropriations
27


in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
final
budget
approved
by
the
28


governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
limitation.
29


If
a
new
revenue
source
is
proposed,
95
percent
of
the
30


estimate
of
that
new
revenue,
less
the
estimated
refunds
31


payable,
shall
be
included
in
the
revenue
estimate
used
32


to
calculate
the
expenditure
limitation.
If
a
new
revenue
33


decrease
is
proposed,
100
percent
of
the
estimate
of
that
34


revenue
decrease
shall
be
included
in
the
revenue
estimate
