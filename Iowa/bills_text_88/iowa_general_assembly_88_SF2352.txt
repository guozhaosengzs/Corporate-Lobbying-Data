BACKGROUND.
Generally,
there
are
two
types
of
projects
26


authorized
under
Code
section
468.126,
a
repair
which
refers
27


to
restoring
a
facility
to
its
original
design
or
efficiency
28


and
an
improvement
which
enhances
or
enlarges
the
district’s
29


facility.
A
board
determines
whether
to
conduct
a
hearing
30


of
landowners
regarding
a
repair
or
improvement
based
on
the
31


project’s
estimated
cost
as
provided
in
the
report.
A
hearing
32


is
required
if
the
estimated
cost
of
the
repair
or
improvement
33


exceeds
$50,000.
In
that
case,
the
report
is
presented
at
34


the
hearing.
There
are
several
types
of
boards
that
may
have
