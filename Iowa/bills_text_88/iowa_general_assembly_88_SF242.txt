Under
current
law,
an
employer
has
an
affirmative
defense
8


to
a
claim
under
Code
section
216.6A
if
a
pay
differential
9


is
based
on
any
other
factor
other
than
prohibited
wage
10


discrimination.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
has
an
11


affirmative
defense
to
a
claim
under
Code
section
216.6A
if
a
12


pay
differential
is
based
on
any
other
bona
fide
factor
other
13


than
prohibited
discrimination,
including
but
not
limited
14


to
a
bona
fide
factor
relating
to
education,
training,
or
15


experience.
However,
this
defense
shall
only
apply
if
the
16


employer
demonstrates
that
the
factor
is
not
based
on
or
17


derived
from
prohibited
wage
discrimination,
is
job
related
18


with
respect
to
the
position
in
question,
and
is
consistent
19


with
a
business
necessity.
The
bill
defines
“business
20


necessity”
as
an
overriding
legitimate
business
purpose
21


such
that
the
factor
relied
upon
effectively
fulfills
the
22


business
purpose
it
is
supposed
to
serve.
This
affirmative
23


defense
shall
not
apply
if
the
employee
demonstrates
that
an
24


alternative
business
practice
exists
that
would
serve
the
same
25


business
purpose
without
producing
the
wage
differential.
26


The
bill
provides
that
affirmative
defenses
to
a
claim
under
27


Code
section
216.6A
are
not
applicable
unless
one
or
more
of
28


the
defenses
account
for
the
entire
pay
differential
that
is
29


the
subject
of
the
claim.
30


The
bill
also
requires
the
civil
rights
commission

establish
