BACKGROUND.
A

after
a
board
7


receives
a
petition
by
two
or
more
persons
who
own
land
in
the
8


proposed
district
(Code
sections
468.7
and
468.8),
the
board
9


appoints
an
engineer
to
prepare
a
report
(Code
sections
468.10
10


through
468.12),
and
the
board
holds
a
public
hearing
on
the
11


matter
after
providing
notice
to
each
landowner
in
the
district
12


and
by
newspaper
publication
(Code
sections
468.14
and
468.15)
13


based
on
procedures
relating
to
the
publication
of
county
14


notices
for
elections
or
other
official
matters
(Code
section
15


331.305).
Before
or
after
the
district
is
established,
the
16


board
must
appoint
a
commission
to
prepare
a
report
determining
17


the
classification
for
each
40-acre
tract
or
fraction
of
that
18


tract
in
the
district
which
is
used
to
impose
an
assessment
19


based
on
benefits
from
improvements
to
be
made
to
that
tract
20


(Code
sections
468.13
and
468.38
through
468.44).
The
board
21


must
hold
a
hearing
regarding
the
commissioner’s
report
22


which
is
conducted
in
the
same
manner
as
when
the
district
23


is
established.
However,
the
notice
for
classification
must
24


also
include
a
statement
listing
the
amount
of
the
assessment
25


of
costs
and
expenses
of
construction
of
improvements
as
26


apportioned
to
each
owner
for
each
tract
or
fraction
of
a
tract
27


and
the
filing
of
objections.
