EXPLANATION

The

agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by

assembly.
12


Code
chapter

authorizes

or
a
combination
of
both
taxes
14


within
the
county,
excluding
those
areas
within
a
benefited
15


emergency
medical
services
district
under
Code
chapter
357F,
16


to
be
used
for
emergency
medical
services,
if
the
taxes
are
17


approved
at
election.
18


This
bill
strikes
the
requirement
for
an
election
to
approve
19


a
tax
authorized
by
Code
chapter
422D
and
instead
requires
that
20


the

a

21


emergency
medical
service
to
be
an
essential
service
within
the

county.
The
bill
requires
the
resolution
to
be
considered
and
23


voted
on
for
approval
at
two
meetings
of
the
board
prior
to
the
24


meeting
at
which
it
is
to
be
finally
approved
by
a
majority
25


of
the
board
by
recorded
vote.
The
bill
establishes
notice
26


requirements
and
prohibits
the
requirements
for
approval
of
27


the
resolution
or
approval
of
the
imposition
of
a
tax
from
28


being
suspended
or
waived
by
the
board.
The
bill
limits
the
29


county
to
imposing
either
the
income
surtax
or
the
property
30


tax
following
adoption
of
the
required
resolution.
The
bill
31


specifies
that
a
tax
under
Code
chapter
422D
may
be
imposed
for
32


a
period
not
to
exceed
five
consecutive
years
after
adoption
33


of
the
resolution
and
requires
an
extension
or
renewal
of
the
34


period
of
time
for
imposition
of
a
tax
to
comply
with

strikes
