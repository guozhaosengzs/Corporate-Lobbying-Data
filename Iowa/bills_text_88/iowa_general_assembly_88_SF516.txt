Federal
determination
creates
rebuttable
presumption.
In
15


determining
whether
an
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien,
the

court
shall
consider
the
federal
government’s
determination
17


of
the
immigration
status
of
the
employee
pursuant
to
8
18


U.S.C.
§1373(c).
The
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
the
19


federal
government’s
determination.
The
federal
government’s
20


determination
that
the
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien
21


creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
the
employee’s
unauthorized
22


status.
The
employer
may
present
evidence
that
the
employee
23


is
not
an
unauthorized
alien.
24


8.
Good-faith
compliance.
For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
25


an
employer
that
establishes
that
it
has
complied
in
good
26


faith
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§1324a(b)
establishes
27


a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the
employer
did
not
28


knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
An
employer
is
29


considered
to
have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
30


§1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
31


technical
or
procedural
failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
32


there
is
a
good-faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
33


For
purposes
of
this
subsection,
“good-faith
attempt
to
comply”
34


means
an
employer
to
which
all
of
the
following
apply
with
35


-5-


SF

88


je/rn/mb

S.F.
516


respect
to
an
employee
hired
or
rehired
by
the
employer:
1


a.
The
employer
made
a
bona
fide
attempt
to
meet
the
2


requirements
for
completion
of
the
form
I-9
for
the
employee
3


found
in
8
C.F.R.
§274a.2(a)(3),
as
amended
through
January
1,
4


2019.
5


b.
The
employer
was
a
participating
employer
in
the
e-verify
6


program
at
the
time
the
employee
was
hired
or
rehired.
7


c.
The
employer
can
demonstrate
that
the
employer
attempted
8


to
verify
the
employment
eligibility
of
the
employee
through
9


the
e-verify
program.
10


9.
Entrapment
as
affirmative
defense.
11


a.
It
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
violation
of
subsection
12


1
that
the
employer
was
entrapped.
To
claim
entrapment,
the
13


employer
must
admit
by
the
employer’s
testimony
or
other
14


evidence
the
substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
15


employer
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
16


of
proving
all
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
17


evidence:
18


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
19


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the
20


employer.
21


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
22


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
23


b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
24


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
25


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
26


an
opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
The
conduct
of
law
27


enforcement
officers
and
their
agents
may
be
considered
in
28


determining
if
an
employer
has
proven
entrapment.
