EXPLANATION
13


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
14


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
15


Current
law
requires
a
bicycle
to
have
a
front
lighted
lamp
16


and
either
a
rear
lighted
lamp
or
a
rear
reflector
at
any
time
17


from
sunset
to
sunrise,
and
at
such
other
times
when
conditions
18


such
as
fog,
snow,
sleet,
or
rain
provide
insufficient
lighting
19


to
render
clearly
discernible
persons
and
vehicles
on
the
20


highway
at
a
distance
of
500
feet
ahead.
21


This
bill
requires
every
bicycle
or
bicycle
rider
to
have
a
22


front
and
rear
lighted
lamp
during
the
stated
periods
of
time,
23


and
strikes
the
provision
allowing
a
bicycle
or
bicycle
rider
24


to
equip
a
rear
reflector
in
lieu
of
the
rear
lighted
lamp.
The
25


scheduled
fine
for
violating
this
provision
is
$25.
However,
26


the
bill
provides
that
a
citation
issued
for
failure
to
have
27


a
front
lamp
or
rear
lamp
on
a
bicycle
or
on
a
bicycle
rider
28


must
first
provide
for
a
72-hour
period
within
which
the
person
29


charged
with
the
violation
shall
replace
or
repair
the
lamp.
30


If
the
person
complies
with
the
directive
to
replace
or
repair
31


the
lamp,
the
citation
must
be
expunged.
32


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2020.
