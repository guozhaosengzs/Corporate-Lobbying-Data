A
BILL
FOR


An
Act
requiring
that
certain
housing
constructed
using
public
1


funds
incorporates
minimum
universal
design
standards
2


relating
to
accessibility.

BE

ENACTED
BY

OF
THE
STATE
OF

Section
1.
NEW
SECTION
.
104A.3
Minimum
universal
design
1


standards
——
accessibility.

1.
Findings.
The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
3


it
is
the
policy
of
this
state
to
encourage
the
design
and
4


construction
of
affordable
homes
and
apartments
that
people
5


of
all
ages
and
abilities
can
independently
access,
enter,
6


and
visit.
Incorporating
universal
design
features
into
new
7


construction
dramatically
reduces
the
need
to
make
and
pay
8


for
home
modifications
that
address
accessibility
and
use
9


restrictions
related
to
aging
and
temporary
or
long-term
10


injury,
illness,
or
disability.
11


2.

the
12


context
otherwise
requires:
13


a.
“New

means
housing
that
is
being
14


constructed
on-site
and
did
not
previously
exist
in
residential
15


or
nonresidential
form.
“New
construction”
does
not
include
the
16


alteration,
renovation,
or
remodeling
of
an
existing
structure.
17


b.
“Publicly
financed
housing”
includes
any
single-family
18

constructed
in
whole
or
