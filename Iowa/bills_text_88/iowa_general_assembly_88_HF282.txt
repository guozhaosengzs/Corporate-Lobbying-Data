including
any
medical
condition

health
1


care
practitioner
determines
the
use
of
medical
cannabidiol
2


could
be
medically
beneficial.
3


The
bill
requires
that
any
certification
made
by
a
health
4


care
practitioner

a
patient
for
a
debilitating
medical
5


condition
not
explicitly
included

pursuant

cannabidiol
to
