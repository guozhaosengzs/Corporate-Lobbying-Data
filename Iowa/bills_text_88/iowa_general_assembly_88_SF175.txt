EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
13


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
14


This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
End-of-Life
Options
Act”.
The
15


bill
provides
for
a
competent
adult
patient,
who
is
a
resident
16


of
the
state
of
Iowa,
who
is
terminally
ill
with
less
than
six
17


months
to
live
as
verified
by
two
physicians,
to
voluntarily
18


request
medication
that
will
end
the
person’s
life.
The
19


bill
provides
that
the
patient
must
make
an
oral
request,
a
20


subsequent
oral
request
no
less
than
15
days
after
the
initial
21


request,
and
a
written
request
for
the
medication.
There
is
22


also
a
48-hour
waiting
period
between
the
submission
of
the
23


written
request
and
the
writing
of
the
prescription.
The
bill
24


specifies
the
responsibilities
of
the
attending
physician
and
25


the
consulting
physician.
The
bill
includes
a
provision
for
26


counseling
if
the
attending
physician
deems
it
appropriate,
the
27


notification
of
next
of
kin,
the
right
to
rescind
a
request
at
28


any
time,
and
documentation
requirements.
The
bill
provides
29


for
the
effect
of
a
request
for
medication
to
end
the
person’s
30


life
on
the
construction
of
wills,
contracts,
and
statutes
as


31


well
as
on
insurance
and
annuity
policies.
32


The
bill
provides
that
the
provisions
of
the
bill
are
not
33


to
be
construed
to
authorize
a
physician
or
any
other
person
34


to
end
a
patient’s
life
by
lethal
injection,
mercy
killing,
35
