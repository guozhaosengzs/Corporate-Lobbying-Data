The

finds
and

that
the
right
2


of
individuals
to
pursue
a
chosen
business,
profession,
3


or
occupation
free
from
arbitrary
or
excessive
government
4


interference,
is
a
fundamental
civil
right;
the
freedom
to
5


earn
an
honest
living
traditionally
has
provided
the
surest
6


means
for
economic
mobility;
in
recent
years,
many
regulations
7


of
entry
into
businesses,
professions,
and
occupations
have
8


exceeded
legitimate
public
purposes
and
have
had
the
effect
of
9


arbitrarily
limiting
entry
and
reducing
competition;
the
burden
10


of
excessive
regulation
is
borne
most
heavily
by
individuals
11


outside
the
economic
mainstream
for
whom
opportunities
for
12


economic
advancement
are
curtailed;
and
it
is
in
the

interest
to
ensure
the
right
of
all
individuals
to
pursue
14


legitimate
entrepreneurial
and
professional
opportunities
15


to
the
limits
of
their
talents

of
this
right,

that
regulations
of

are

The
bill
establishes

three
members
of

senate
appointed

The
bill
defines
“sunset”
as
the
1


termination
of
all
activities
of
a
board.
2


The
sunset
of
a
board
does
not
affect
the
rights
and
duties
3


that
matured,
penalties
incurred
or
imposed,
civil
or
criminal
4


liabilities
that
arose,
or
proceedings
initiated
in
connection
5


with
the
board
before
the
effective
date
of
the
board’s
sunset,
6


unless
otherwise
expressly
provided
by
law.
7


The
bill
authorizes
a
board
that
has

to
continue
in

existence
to
conclude
its
business
until
July
1
of
the
fiscal
9


year
following
the
fiscal
year
in
which
the
board
was
sunset.
10


Unless
otherwise
provided
by
law,
the
sunset
of
a
board
does
11


not
reduce
or
otherwise
limit
the
powers
and
authority
of
12


the
board
during
the
concluding
year.
The
bill
requires
the
13


board
to
terminate
all
activities
on
or
before
that
date,
14


and
provides
that
all
rules
adopted
by
the
board
shall
be
15


void
on
that
date.
The
bill
provides
that
any
unobligated
or
16


unexpended
appropriations
of
a
board
that
has
sunset
shall
17


lapse
and
revert
to
the
general
fund
of
the
state
on
that
date.
18


The
bill
provides
that
all
moneys
in
a
dedicated
fund
of
a
19


board
that
has
sunset
shall
be
transferred
to
the
general
fund
20


of
the
state
on
July
1
of
the
fiscal
year
following

year
in
which
the
board
was
sunset,
except
as
provided
in
the
22


bill
or
as
otherwise
provided
by

Any
portion
of
a
law
23


dedicating
moneys
to
a
specific
fund
of
a
board
that

24


is

division
relates
to
the
review
of
rules
governing
the
practice
1


of
occupations.
The
bill
establishes
a
new
Code
chapter
to
be
2


known
as
the
“Iowa
Right
to
Earn
a
Living
Act”.
3


The
bill
requires
each
board
to
submit
a
copy
of
all
of
4


the
board’s
current
and
pending
entry
regulations,
which
the
5


bill
defines
as
rules
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
6


an
occupational
or
professional
group,
to
the
occupational
7


licensing
advisory
committee
by
December
31,
2020.
The
8


committee
shall
review
all
such
entry
regulations
and
submit
9


a
report
to
the
general
assembly
by
the
first
week
of
the
2022
10


legislative
session.
11


After
December
1,
2020,
the
bill
requires
each
board
to
12


submit
a
proposed
entry
regulation
to
the
committee
prior
to
13


submitting
a
notice
of
intended
action
to
the
administrative
14


rules
coordinator
and
the
Iowa
administrative
code
editor.
The
15


committee
shall
meet
at
least
monthly
to
review
such
entry
16


regulations.
In
addition,
the
bill
allows
the
chairpersons
of
17


the
committee
to
request
a
board
to
submit
an
entry
regulation
18


for
review
and
the
governor
to
request
that
the
committee,
19


at
the
committee’s
discretion,
review
a
particular
entry
20


regulation.
21


In
conducting
a
review
of
an
entry
regulation,
the
bill
22


requires
the
committee
to
consider
whether
the
entry
regulation
23


is
required
by
law;
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
health,
24


safety,
or
welfare;
unnecessarily
inhibits
competition
25


or
restricts
entry
into
a
business,
trade,
profession,
or
26


occupation;
is
the
least
restrictive
or
burdensome
means
to
27


accomplish
the
goal;
or
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
board’s
28


statutory
authority.
If
the
committee
finds
that
the
entry
29


regulation
is
not
required
by
law
and
is
also
otherwise
30


deficient
as
provided
by
the
bill,
the
committee
may
disapprove
31


of
the
entry
regulation
and
request
that
the
board
either
32


amend
the
proposed
entry
regulation
or
decline
to
proceed
with
33


adoption
of
the
entry
regulation.
The
bill
requires
notice
of
34


disapproval
to
be
posted
publicly

assembly’s

the
board
seeking

committee.
The
bill
prohibits
a
board
from
submitting
3


a
notice
of
intended
action
until
it
has
received
approval
or
4


disapproval
from
the
committee.
5


If
a
board
makes
substantial
changes
to
a
proposed
entry
6


regulation,
the
board
shall
resubmit
the
proposed
entry
7


regulation
to
the
committee
for
review.
If
the
board
chooses
8


not
to
respond
to
the
committee’s
recommendations,
the
board
9


may
continue
with
the
rulemaking
process.
The
bill
allows
the
10


committee
to
vote
to
submit
a
bill
to
the
general
assembly
to
11


suspend
the
rulemaking
authority
of
a
board
that
declines
to

comply
with
recommendations
of
the
committee.

The
division
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
