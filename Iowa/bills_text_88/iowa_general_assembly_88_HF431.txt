BACKGROUND.
A
farm
tenancy
refers
to
a
lease
of
agricultural
24


land
in
which
the
lessee
(farm
tenant)
is
a
person
who
produces
25


crops
or
provides
for
the
care
and
feeding
of
livestock
on
26


the
leased
land
(Code
section
562.1A).
Generally,
all
farm
27


tenancies
terminate
on
March
1,
at
the
end
of
the
farm
tenant’s
28


crop
year.
However,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
termination,
29


one
party
to
the
lease
(landlord
or
farm
tenant,
or
a
successor
30


in
interest)
must
have
given
the
other
party
written
notice
31


of
the
termination
by
the
previous
September
1
(Code
sections
32


562.5
through
562.7).
Without
such
timely
written
notice
of
33


the
termination,
the
lease
continues
under
its
same
terms
and
34


conditions
until
the
next
September
1.

three
alternative
methods
for
providing
notice
to
the
intended
1


recipient
prior
to
September
1,
including
by
acceptance
of
2


service
signed
by
the
recipient,
serving
notice
personally
on
3


the
recipient
or
failing
that
by
publication
in
a
newspaper,
or
4


by
certified
mail
sent
to
the
last-known
mailing
address
of
the
5


recipient.
In
the
last
case,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
6


recipient
actually
receives
the
notice.
