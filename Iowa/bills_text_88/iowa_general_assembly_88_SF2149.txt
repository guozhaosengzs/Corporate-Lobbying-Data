The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
5


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
6


Under
current
law,
a
person
is
prohibited
from
operating
a
7


motor
vehicle
equipped
with
a
front
windshield,
a
side
window
8


to
the
immediate
right
or
left
of
the
driver,
or
a
sidewing
9


forward
of
and
to
the
left
or
right
of
the
driver
which
is
10


excessively
dark
or
reflective
so
that
it
is
difficult
for
11


a
person
outside
the
motor
vehicle
to
see
into
the
motor
12


vehicle
through
the
windshield,
window,
or
sidewing.
Under
13


rules
adopted
by
the
department
of
transportation
(761
IAC
14

“excessively

or
29


left

which
has
a

of
70
percent

or
less,
the
