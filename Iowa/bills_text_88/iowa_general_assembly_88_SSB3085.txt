The

a
substantial
or
permanent
loss
or
10


impairment
of
a
bodily
function,
substantial
disfigurement,


11


or
death,
which
warrants
a
finding
that
imposition

such
a
12


limitation
would
deprive
the
plaintiff

for
13


the
injuries

.

EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
17


This
bill
relates
to
the
total
amount
of
noneconomic
damages
18


recoverable
in
a
civil
action
for
personal
injury
or
death
19


against
a
health
care
provider.
20


Current
law
limits
to
$250,000
the
amount
of
noneconomic
21


damages
recoverable
for
any
occurrence
resulting
in
injury
or
22


death
of
a
patient
regardless
of
the
number
of
plaintiffs,
23


derivative
claims,
theories
of
liability,
or
defendants
in
24


the
civil
action,
unless
the
jury
determines
that
there
is
25


a
substantial
or
permanent
loss
or
impairment
of
a
bodily
26


function,
substantial
disfigurement,
or
death,
which
warrants
27


a
finding
that
imposition
of
such
a
limitation
would
deprive
28


the
plaintiff
of
just
compensation
for
the
injuries
sustained.
29


Current
law
also
provides
that
the
limitation
on
damages
30


shall
not
apply
as
to
a
defendant
if
the
defendant’s
actions
31


constituted
actual
malice.


32


The
bill
eliminates
the
exception
to
the
limitation
33


of
$250,000
that
would
allow
the
jury
to
determine
if
the
34


imposition
of
such
a
limitation
would
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
