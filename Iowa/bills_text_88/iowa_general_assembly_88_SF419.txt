adult
abuse
reporter
training.
1


The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
that
the
director
of
2


the
department
of
public
health
review
and
approve
mandatory
3


reporter
training
curricula
for
employees
who
work
in
a
4


position
that
classifies
the
employee
as
a
mandatory
reporter
5


and
the
position
classification
does
not
have
a
mandatory
6


reporter
training
curriculum
approved
by
a
licensing
or
7


examining
board.
8


The
bill
eliminates
current
law
relating
to
mandatory
9


dependent
adult
abuse
training,
including
training
for
10


dependent
adult
abuse
that
occurs
in
facilities
and
programs,
11


that
provides
that
to
the
extent
a
hospital
or
similar
12


public
or
private
facility
provides
approved
training
on
13


the
employer’s
premises,
the
hours
of
training
completed
by
14


employees
are
included
in
the
calculation
of
nursing
or
service
15


hours
required
to
be
provided
to
a
patient
or
resident
per
day.
16


Current
law
provides
that
a
hospital
or
similar
institution,
17


or
a
public
or
private
institution,
agency,
or
facility
are
18


responsible
for
providing
mandatory
reporter
training
to
19


employees
who
are
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
and
20


dependent
adult
abuse.
If
a
person
who
is
deemed
a
mandatory
21


reporter
is
self-employed,
employed
in
a
licensed
or
certified
22


profession,
or
employed
by
a
facility
or
program
that
is
23


subject
to
licensure,
regulation,
or
approval
by
a
state
24


agency,
the
person
may
complete
the
initial
or
additional
25


training
requirements
through
any
of
the
following
ways:
a
26


continuing
education
program
required
under
Code
chapter
27


272C
(relating
to
regulation
of
licensed
professions
and
28


occupations);
a
training
program
using
a
curriculum
approved
by
29


the
director
of
public
health
pursuant
to
Code
section
135.11
30


(relating
to
the
duties
of
the
director
of
the
department
31


of
public
health);
or
a
training
program
using
an
approved
32


curriculum
offered
by
the
appropriate
public
agency.
33


The
bill
strikes
current
law
and
requires
the
department
34


of
human

to
develop
curriculum
and

for
all
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
and
dependent
1


adult
abuse,
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
the
person
is
2


employed.
Under
the
bill,
an
employer
of
a
person
required
3


by
law
to
make
a
report
of
child
abuse
or
dependent
adult
4


abuse
may
provide
supplemental
child
abuse
and
dependent
adult
5


abuse
training,
specific
to
the
identification
and
reporting
6


of
child
abuse
or
dependent
adult
abuse
as
it
relates
to
7


the
person’s
professional
practice,
in
addition
to
the
core
8


training
provided
by
DHS.
The
bill
increases
the
frequency
of
9


training
for
mandatory
child
abuse
and
dependent
adult
abuse
10


reporters
from
once
every
five
years
to
once
every
three
years,
11


and
provides
a
transition
provision
for
persons
who
received
a
12


child
abuse
or
dependent
adult

certificate
prior
13


to
July
1,
2019.
14


Under
current
law,
a
person
required
to
report
both
child
15


abuse
and
dependent
adult
abuse
may
complete
the
requisite
16


training
through
a
combined
training
program.
The
bill
strikes
17


current
law
and
requires
such
persons
to
complete
separate
18


child
abuse
training
and
dependent
adult
