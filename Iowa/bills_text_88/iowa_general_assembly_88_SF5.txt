the
area
shall
not

26


tax
if

including
one
possessing
under
a
contract
27


of
sale,
and
the
owner’s
direct
antecedents
or
descendants
28


have
owned

computed
by
multiplying
the
consolidated
levy
for
each
of
those
30


years,
if
any,
of
the
five
preceding
years
for
which
the
area
31


received
the
exemption
for
fruit-tree
or
forest


reservation
32


times
the
assessed
value
of
the
area
that
would
have
been
taxed
33


but
for

tax
exemption.
This
tax
shall
be
