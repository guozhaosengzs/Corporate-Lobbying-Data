and

for
a
dually
eligible
Medicare
and
Medicaid
member
receiving
1


the
Medicare
hospice
benefit,
to
allow
Medicaid
managed
care
2


organizations
(MCOs)
and
the
Medicaid
fee-for-service
(FFS)
3


payment
system
to
reimburse
the
nursing
facility
directly
for
4


the
room
and
board
expenses
at
95
percent
of
the
base
rate
5


rather
than
indirectly
as
a
pass-through
payment
from
the
6


hospice
services
provider.
The
bill
requires
DHS
to
report
7


receipt
of
such
approval
to
the
chairpersons
and
ranking
8


members
of
the
appropriations
committees
of
the
house
and
9


senate,
the
co-chairpersons
and
ranking
members
of
the
joint
10


appropriations
subcommittee
on
health
and
human
services,
11


and
the
legislative
services
agency.
The
bill
requires
DHS
12


to
adopt
administrative
rules
to
administer
the
bill
and
13


specifically
to
allow
Medicaid
MCOs
and
the
department’s
14


FFS
Medicaid
payment
system
to
reimburse
a
nursing
facility
15


directly
for
the
room
and
board
expenses
at
95
percent
of
the
16


base
rate
as
provided
in
the
bill.
17


Currently,
the
Medicare
hospice
benefit
covers
the
costs
of
18


palliative
care
for
an
individual
who
is
terminally
ill
in
the
19


individual’s
home
or
in
a
nursing
facility.
Medicare
does
not
20


have
a
long-term
custodial
nursing
facility
benefit,
so
if
an
21


individual
elects
the
Medicare
hospice
benefit
in
a
nursing
22


facility,
the
individual’s
room
and
board
are
not
covered
by
23


Medicare
and
the
individual
or
a
third-party
payor
must
pay
for
24


the
costs
of
the
room
and
board.
For
those
individuals
dually
25


eligible
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
who
elect
the
Medicare
26


hospice
benefit,
Medicare
is
financially
responsible
for
the
27


hospice
care
and
the
Medicaid
program
is
the
third-party
payor
28


responsible
for
the
nursing
facility
room
and
board
expense.
29


For
the
nursing
facility
room
and
board
care,
the
Medicaid
30


program
must
provide
for
payment
in
an
amount
equal
to
at
least
31


95
percent
of
the
Medicaid
daily
nursing
facility
base
rate
32


(the
rate
the
state
Medicaid
program
pays
for
nursing
facility
33


services
furnished
to
an
individual
who
has
not
elected
to


34


receive
hospice
care).
Historically,
the
Medicaid
program
35


-2-


LSB

pf/rh

H.F.

has
paid
the
hospice
provider
for
the
nursing
facility
room
1


and
board
expenses
of
dually
eligible
individuals
who
elect
2


the
hospice
benefit,
and
the
hospice
provider
has
then
passed
3


this
payment
on
to
the
nursing
facility
under
a
contract
with
4


the
nursing
facility.
Current
practice
is
for
most
hospice
5


providers
to
pay
100
percent
of
the
nursing
facility
base
rate
6


to
the
nursing
facility.
7


Pursuant
to
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1038,
DHS
was
directed
to
8


review
the
hospice
benefit
for
dually
eligible
individuals
in
9


a
nursing
facility
and
report
options
for
elimination
of
the
10


pass-through
payments
to
the
chairperson
and
ranking
members
11


of
the
joint
appropriations
subcommittee
on
health
and
human
12


services,
the
legislative
service
agency,
and
the
legislative
13


caucus
staffs
on
or
before
October
1,
2018.
DHS
submitted
the
14


report
that
included
four
options.
The
bill
reflects
option
15


1
of
the
report
which
is
budget
neutral
and
would
require
DHS
16


to
request
federal
approval
to
allow
Medicaid
managed
care
17


organizations
and
the
Medicaid
fee-for-service
payment
system
18


to
pay
the
nursing
facility
directly
for
the
nursing
facility
19


room
and
board
costs,
and
eliminate
the
pass-through
payment
20


utilizing
the
hospice
provider.
