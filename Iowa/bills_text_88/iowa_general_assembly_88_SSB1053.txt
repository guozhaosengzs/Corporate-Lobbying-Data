The
inclusion
of

the
explanation’s
substance
by

16


Current
law
caps

rent
is
greater
than
$700
per
month
at
$20
per
day
and
$100
18


per
month.
Current
law
also
allows
an
aggrieved
party
to
19


recover
actual
damages
in
certain
situations
when
a
prohibited
20


provision
is
willingly
or
knowingly
used
in
a
rental
agreement.
21


This
bill
allows
a
rental
agreement
to
provide
for
late
22


fees
not
to
exceed
$20
per
day
and
$100
per
month
for
rental
23


agreements
in
which
rent
is
greater
than
$700
per
month
but
24


not
more
than
$1,400
per
month.
When
rent
exceeds
$1,400
per
25


month,
a
rental
agreement
may
provide
for
late
fees
of
no
26


more
than
$30
per
day
and
$150
per
month.
Furthermore,
if
27


a
landlord
seeks
to
enforce
or
accepts
a
tenant’s
voluntary
28


compliance
with
a
prohibited
provision,
the
court
may
award
the
29


tenant
an
amount
not
to
