this

is
subject
to

proposal
in
the
same
manner
as
an
original
notice
is
served
1


under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
Upon
service
of
such
2


notice,
the
proposed
assessment
shall
be
treated
as
a
contested
3


case
under
chapter
17A.
However,
to
remain
a
contested
case,
4


an
employer
must
request
a
hearing
within
thirty
days
of
being
5


served.
6


3.
If
an
employer
does
not
request
a
hearing
pursuant
7


to
subsection
2
or
if
the
commissioner
determines,
after
an
8


appropriate
hearing,
that
an
employer
is
in
violation
of
this
9


chapter
or
the
rules
adopted
pursuant
to
this
chapter,
the
10


commissioner
shall
assess
a
civil
penalty
which
is
consistent
11


with
the
provisions
of
subsection
1
and
which
is
rendered
with
12


due
consideration
for
the
penalty
amount
in
terms
of
the
size
13


of
the
employer’s
business,
the
gravity
of
the
violation,
14


the
good
faith
of
the
employer,
and
the
history
of
previous
15


violations.
16


4.
An
employer
may
seek
judicial
review
of
any
assessment
17


rendered
under
subsection
3
by
instituting
proceedings
for
18


judicial
review
pursuant
to
chapter
17A.
However,
such
19


proceedings
must
be
instituted
in
the
district
court
of
the
20


county
in
which
the
violation
or
one
of
the
violations
occurred
21


and
within
thirty
days
of
the
day
on
which
the
employer
was
22


notified
that
an
assessment
has
been
rendered.
Also,
an
23


employer
may
be
required,
at
the
discretion
of
the
district
24


court
and
upon
instituting
such
proceedings,
to
deposit
the
25


amount
assessed
with
the
clerk
of
the
district
court.
Any
26


moneys
so
deposited
shall
either
be
returned
to
the
employer
27


or
be
forwarded
to
the
commissioner
for
deposit
in
the
general
28


fund
of
the
state,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
judicial
29


review,
including
any
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
30


5.
After
the
time
for
seeking
judicial
review
has
expired
31


or
after
all
judicial
review
has
been
exhausted
and
the
32


commissioner’s
assessment
has
been
upheld,
the
commissioner
33


shall
request
the
attorney
general
to
recover
the
assessed
34


penalties
in
a
civil
action.

The

not
constitute
agreement
with
17


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general

18


This
bill
creates
a
new
Code
chapter
91F
that
requires
an
19


employer
to
provide
an
employee
with
appropriate
meal
periods
20


and
appropriate
rest
periods.
21


The
bill
states
that
an
appropriate
meal
period
shall
be
not
22


less
than
30
minutes
during
an
employee’s
work
period
of
at
23


least
seven
hours.
The
meal
period
is
to
be
taken
between
the
24


second
and
fifth
hours
of
the
work
or,
if
the
employee
works
25


more
than
seven
hours,
between
the
third
and
sixth
hours.
26


The
bill
states
that
an
appropriate
rest
period
shall
be
a
27


paid
period
of
not
less
than
10
minutes
during
every
four-hour
28


work
period.
The
rest
period
is
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
work
29


period.
The
rest
period
is
in
addition
to
the
meal
period
and
30


cannot
be
added
to
the
meal
period
or
deducted
from
the
work
31


period
to
reduce
the
overall
length
of
the
total
work
period.
32


The
bill
defines
an
“employee”
as
a
natural
person
who
is
33


employed
in
this
state
for
wages
by
an
employer.
An
“employer”
34


is
defined
as
a
person,
as
defined
in
Code
section

who

H.F.

employs
a
natural
person
for
wages.
1


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
is
not
required
to
pay
for
2


a
meal
period
if
an
employee
is
free
from
work
duties
during
3


the
employee’s
entire
meal
period.
4


The
bill
allows
three
exemptions
to
the
meal
and
rest
period
5


requirements.
The
first
exemption
is
if
the
meal
and
rest
6


period
requirements
are
modified
by
the
terms
of
a
collective
7


bargaining
agreement.
However,
the
exemption
is
valid
only
8


if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
the
9


employees
prescribes
specific
terms
concerning
meal
periods
and
10


rest
periods.
11


The
second
exemption
states
that
meal
and
rest
period
12


requirements
apply
to
hourly
paid
and
salary-paid
employees.
13


However,
management
or
employees
involved
in
certain
14


agricultural
jobs
are
not
required
to
have
breaks
or
meal
15


breaks.
16


The
third
exemption
is
if
an
employer
shows
that
the
ordinary
17


nature
and
circumstance
of
the
work
prevented
the
employer
from
18


establishing
and
maintaining
a
regular
scheduled
meal
period.
19


The
bill
provides
civil
penalties
for
violating
the
new
20


Code
chapter.
An
employer
who
violates
the
provisions
shall
21


be
subject
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
$100
for
each
violation.
The
22


labor
commissioner
may
recover
the
penalties
under
Code
chapter
23


17A
contested
case
procedures.
Any
penalties
recovered
shall
24


be
deposited
in
the
general
fund
of
the
state.
25


The
commissioner
may
propose
that
an
employer
be
assessed
a
26


penalty
by
serving
the
employer
with
notice
of
a
penalty
in
the
27


same
manner
as
an
original
notice
is
served
under
the
rules
of
28


civil
procedure.
29


The
bill
provides
the
labor
commissioner
with
the
authority
30


to
provide
further
exemptions
from
new
Code
chapter
91F
when
31


reasonable.
Also,
the
labor
commissioner
or
the
commissioner’s
32


designee
may
inspect
employment
records
relating
to
rest
33


periods
for
employees
and

or
