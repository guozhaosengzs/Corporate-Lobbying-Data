MISTREATMENT
OF

PENALTIES.


32


Currently,
the
criminal
penalty
for
a
conviction
of
animal
33


abuse
is
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
This
bill
provides
that
34

a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
for
35

that
offense
is
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony.
The
current
1


criminal
penalty
for
a
conviction
of
animal
neglect
is
a
simple
2


misdemeanor,
unless
the
convicted
person’s
actions
resulted
3


in
a
serious
injury
to
the
animal
or
the
animal’s
death.
In
4


the
instance
in
which
an
animal
is
inflicted
with
a
serious
5


injury,
the
bill
increases
the
enhanced
criminal
penalty
from
a
6


serious
misdemeanor
to
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
Currently,
7


the
criminal
penalty
for
animal
torture
is
an
aggravated
8


misdemeanor
for
the
first
conviction
which
is
enhanced
to
a
9


class
“D”
felony
for
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction.
For
10


each
conviction,
the
court’s
sentencing
order
must
provide
11


that
the
guilty
person
submit
to
psychological
evaluation
and
12


treatment,
and
for
the
first
conviction
the
order
must
require
13


the
guilty
person
complete
a
community
work
requirement.
14


The
bill
provides
the
criminal
penalty
is
a
class
“D”
15


felony
without
regard
to
the
number
of
prior
convictions
and
16


eliminates
the
enhanced
penalty
provision.
The
bill
also
makes
17


certain
changes
in
terminology
for
purposes
of
consistency
and
18


readability.
19


ANIMAL
TORTURE
——
ELEMENT
TO
PROVE
CRIME.
For
animal
20


torture,
the
bill
requires
that
a
person
act
intentionally
21


rather
than
with
a
depraved
or
sadistic
intent.
22


ANIMAL
ABUSE
AND
ANIMAL
TORTURE
——
EXCEPTION
FOR
COMMERCIAL
23


ESTABLISHMENTS.
The
bill
provides
that
the
offenses
classified
24


as
animal
abuse
and
animal
torture
are
not
committed
by
25


a
commercial
establishment
regulated
by
the
department
of
26


agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(DALS)
if
the
commercial
27


establishment’s
conduct
complies
with
certain
standard
of
care
28


requirements.
