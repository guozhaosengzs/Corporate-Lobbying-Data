RELATING
TO
COMMUNITY
CATALYST
BUILDING
REMEDIATION
GRANTS
FOR


EMERGENCY
PROJECTS.


BE
IT
ENACTED
BY
THE
GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
OF
THE
STATE
OF
IOWA:



Section
1.
Section
15.231,
subsection
2,
Code
2019,
is



amended
to
read
as
follows:



2.
a.


The
authority
shall
use
moneys
in
the
fund
to



provide
grants
to
cities
for
the
remediation
of
underutilized



buildings.
The
authority
may
provide
grants
under
this



section
using
a
competitive
scoring
process.
Notwithstanding





subsection
3,
an
emergency
project
shall
be
eligible
for
a



grant
under
this
section.



b.


As
used
in
this
section,
unless
the
context
otherwise



requires:



(1)
“Emergency
project”
means
remediation
of
an



underutilized
building
that
may
present
a
unique
and
immediate





opportunity,
or
a
unique
and
immediate
threat.



(2)


“Unique
and
immediate
opportunity”
means
remediation
of



an
underutilized
building
is
time-sensitive
and
remediation
is





reasonably
expected
to
result
in
economic
growth
for
the
city



in
which
the
underutilized
building
is
located.





(3)
“Unique
and
immediate
threat”
means
remediation
of
an



underutilized
building
may
involve
an
unforeseen
challenge
or



problem
that
has
the
potential
to
result
in
a
catastrophic





failure
of
the
building’s
integrity
and
structural
system.





An
unforeseen
challenge
or
problem
may
include
an
act
of

nature
such
as
a
fire,
flood,
or
storm,
or
an
unexpected





structural
deficiency
such
as
a
compromised
load-bearing



wall.
A
challenge
or
problem
caused
by
deferred
maintenance





on
the
underutilized
building
does
not
qualify
as
a
unique
and





immediate
threat.
