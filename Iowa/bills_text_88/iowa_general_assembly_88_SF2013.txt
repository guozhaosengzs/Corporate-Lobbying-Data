Legislative
intent.

finds
and

all
of
the
following:
7


1.
Iowa’s
communities
are
important
to
the
social
and
8


economic
vitality
of
this
state.
Whether
urban,
suburban,
9


or
rural,
many
communities
are
struggling
with
dilapidated,
10


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
properties.
11


2.
Citizens
of
Iowa
are
affected
adversely
by
dilapidated,
12


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
properties,
13


including
properties
that
have
been
abandoned
due
to
mortgage
14


foreclosure.
15


3.
Dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
16


properties
impose
significant
costs
on
neighborhoods
and
17


communities
by
lowering
property
values,
increasing
fire
18


and
police
protection
costs,
decreasing
tax
revenues,
and
19


undermining
community
cohesion.
20


4.
There
is
an
overwhelming
public
need
to
confront
the
21


problems
caused
by
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
22


tax-delinquent
properties;
to
return
properties
that
are
in
23


non-revenue-generating,
non-tax-producing
status
to
productive
24


status
in
order
to
revitalize
urban,
suburban,
and
rural
25


areas,
provide
affordable
housing,
and
attract
new
industry;
26


and
to
create
jobs
for
the
citizens
of
this
state
through
the
27


establishment
of
new
tools
that
enable
communities
to
turn


28


abandoned
spaces
into
vibrant
places.
29


5.
Land
banks
are
one
of
the
tools
that
communities
can
use
30


to
facilitate
the
return
of
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
31


and
tax-delinquent
properties
to
productive
use.

EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
provides
for
the
establishment
of
land
banks.
4


Division
I
of
the
bill
authorizes
one
or
more
municipalities
5


to
establish
a
land
bank
as
a
method
to
return
dilapidated,
6


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
properties
in
their
7


communities
to
economically
productive
status.
An
established
8


land
bank
is
a
public
agency
for
the
purpose
of
joint
exercise
9


of
governmental
powers,
a
governmental
body
for
purposes
10


of
public
meetings
requirements
of
Code
chapter
21,
and
a
11


government
body
for
purposes
of
public
records
requirements
12


of
Code
chapter
22.
Land
banks
are
subject
to
periodic
13


examination
by
the
auditor
of
state
under
Code
chapter
11.
The
14


bill
sets
membership
requirements
and
term
limits
for
a
board
15


of
directors
of
a
land
bank,
including
interests
that
shall
16


be
represented
on
the
board.
The
bill
requires
the
board
to
17


establish
bylaws
relating
to
governance
of
the
land
bank.
18


Division
I
of
the
bill
grants
a
land
bank
various
powers
19


and
duties,
including
the
authority
to
acquire
properties
20


through
certain
procedures
such
as
issuing
a
trump
bid,
which
21


shall
be
for
all
delinquent
taxes
owed
on
a
property,
at
a
tax
22


sale.
However,
the
bill
explicitly
prohibits
a
land
bank
from
23


possessing
or
exercising
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
The
24


bill
establishes
financing
procedures
that
govern
land
banks,
25


including
allowing
to
be
remitted
to
the
land
bank
up
to
75
26


percent
of
real
property
taxes
collected
on
a
real
property
27


conveyed
by
a
land
bank
that
remains
after
the
division
of
28


taxes
for
an
urban
renewal
area
and
exclusive
of
any
amount
29


levied
by
a
school
district
for
five
consecutive
assessment
30


years.
The
bill
provides
procedures
for
removing
encumbrances
31


on
acquired
property,
including
the
extinguishing
of
tax
liens.
32


The
bill
requires
a
land
bank
to
make
monthly
and
annual
33


reports
to
the
governing
body
that
created
the
land
bank
and
34


submit
an
annual
report
to
the
general
assembly.
