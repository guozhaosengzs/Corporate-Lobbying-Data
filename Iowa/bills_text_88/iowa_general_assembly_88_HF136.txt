CURRENT
IOWA
LAW.
Under
current
law,
motor
vehicles
21


designed
to
carry
not
more
than
nine
persons
as
passengers,
22


either
school
owned
or
privately
owned,
are
excluded
from
the
23


definition
of
“school
bus”
under
Code
section
321.1,
thereby
24


excluding
such
vehicles
from
the
duties
and
requirements
25


relating
to
school
buses
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
321
26


(motor
vehicles
and
law
of
the
road).
To
qualify
under
the
27


exclusion,
a
vehicle
must
be
used
to
transport
pupils
to
28


activity
events
in
which
the
pupils
are
participants
or
used
29


to
transport

type
III
vehicles
are
not
regular
school
buses
but
are
used
1


to
transport
students
in
a
school-related
context
and
may
2


be
marked
as
a
school
bus.
A
type
III
vehicle
is
a
van
or
3


passenger
car,

utility
vehicle,
or
4


station
wagon.
The
difference
between
a
family
automobile
and
5


an
equivalent
type
III
vehicle
is
not
the
vehicle
itself,
but
6


rather
its
use,
as
type
III
vehicles
are
used
by
schools
for
7


purposes
of
student
transportation.
To
qualify
as
a
type
III
8

carry
a
maximum
of
nine
or
fewer
9


people,

less.

CURRENT
FEDERAL

buses
are
subject
to
a
variety
11


of
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards.
Under

12


a

bus
is
a

and
more
than
10
passengers
that
is
used
significantly
14

15


school.

18


motor
vehicles
designed

carry
not
more
than
