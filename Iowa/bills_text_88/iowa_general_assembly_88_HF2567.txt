This
bill

of
retail
motor
fuel
sites
3


(sites)
and

storage
tanks
(e.g.,

and
associated
fittings
and

The
bill

An

to
an

based
on
a

of
agriculture

stewardship
acting
13


in
cooperation
with
the
renewable
fuel
infrastructure
board
14


(board).
The
bill
provides
that
the
board
may
waive
the
15


requirement
that
the
improved
infrastructure
be
used
to
store
16


and
dispense
E-15
gasoline.
A
participating
person
who
acts
in
17


violation
of
an
agreement
is
subject
to
a
civil
penalty.
The
18


bill
also
creates
an
E-15
gasoline
infrastructure
fund
that
is
19
