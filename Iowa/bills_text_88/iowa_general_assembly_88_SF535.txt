EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
modifies
provisions
relating
to
the
regulation
and
4


sale
of
certain
fireworks.
5


Current
Code
chapter
9C
requires
persons
bringing
any
goods,
6


wares,
or
merchandise
into
Iowa
with
the
intent
to
sell
such
7


goods,
wares,
or

to
obtain
a

8


license,
unless
otherwise
exempted
from
licensure.
The
bill
9


provides
that
these
licensure
requirements
shall
not
apply
10


to
persons
selling
consumer

display

novelties,
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
Code
section
727.2.
12


Current
Code
section
100.19
requires
the
state
fire
13


marshal
to
regulate
the
sale
of
consumer
fireworks
in
Iowa
14


by
establishing
licensure
requirements
and
issuing
consumer
15


fireworks
seller
licenses
to

16


The
bill
requires
the

submitted

or
20


no
later
than
the
following
June
13
for
an
application
to
sell
21

If
the
state
fire
marshal
fails
22


to
act
on
a
completed
application
within
the
applicable
time
23


frame,
the
application
shall
be
deemed
approved.
However,
the
24


state
fire
marshal
may
revoke
an
approved
application
for
any
25


intentional
violation
of
Code
section
100.19

The
bill
limits
the
sale

30


The
bill
provides
that
the
state
fire
marshal
shall
adopt
31


rules

33


The

A

may
authorize
a
city
or
3


county
employee
to
conduct
an
inspection
on
behalf
of
the
state

The
bill
provides
that
any

or
authorized
by
the
state
fire
marshal
shall
be
paid
from
6


moneys
deposited

those
enacted
by
the
general
13


assembly
and
any
rules
provided
by
the
division
of
the
state
14


fire
marshal.
Any
law,
ordinance,

regulation
relating
to
15


such
fireworks
adopted
by
a
municipality,
county,
or
other
16


governmental

the
effective
date
of
the

bill
shall
become

in
the
bill.
If
a

is
brought
against
a
municipality,
19


county,
or
other
governmental
unit
based
on
the
adoption
or
20


enforcement
of
a
regulation
in
violation
of
the
bill,
the
21


municipality,

shall
be

liable
for
court
costs,
expenses,
and
reasonable

Current

allows
a
county
to
prohibit

Current

also
allows
a
city
to
prohibit
or
27


limit
the

The
bill
modifies
these
provisions
by
providing
29


that
a
city
or
county
may
by
ordinance
or
resolution
prohibit
30


or
limit
the

of

31


that
are
more
stringent
than
