The
moneys
in
the
fund
7


shall
not
be
expended
or
available
for
expenditure
in
any
8


manner
which
would
permit
their
substitution

However,

requested
but
not
yet
received,
subject
to
the
charging
of
the
14


expenditures
against
the
funds
when
received.
The
moneys
may
15


be
used
for
the
payment
of
costs
of
administration
which
are
16


found
not
to
have
been
properly
and
validly
chargeable
against
17


federal
grants
or
other
funds,
received
for
the
department.
18


The
moneys
in
the
fund
are
specifically
made
available
to
19


replace,
within
a
reasonable
time,
any
moneys
received
by
20


this
state
in
the
form
of
grants
from
the
federal
government
21


for
administrative
expenses
which
because
of
any
action
or
22


contingency
have
been
expended
for
purposes
other
than,
or
in
23


excess
of,
those
necessary
for
the
proper
administration
of
24


the
department.
All
moneys
in
the
fund
shall
be
deposited,
25


administered,
and
disbursed
in
the
same
manner
and
under

insurance
fraud
bureau
special
fund
and
to
the
special
1


employment
security
contingency
fund.
2


Currently,
the
law
requires
the
department
of
workforce
3


development
(IWD)
to
collect
and
deposit
into
the
special
4


employment
security
contingency
fund
(special
fund)
all
5


interest,
fines,
and
penalties
collected
from
employers
due
to
6


their
failure
to
comply
with
unemployment
compensation
fund
7


contribution
requirements.
Some
of
the
moneys
in
the
special
8


fund
are
allocated
to
the
IWD,
some
are
available
to
the
IWD
9


subject
to
restrictions,
and
some
are
available
for
use
at
the
10


discretion
of
the
IWD.
11


The
bill
still
requires
the
IWD
to
collect
the
interest,
12


fines,
and
penalties;
however,
the
bill
provides
that
the
IWD
13


is
to
deposit
such
moneys
in
a
newly
created
insurance
fraud
14


bureau
special
fund.
The
bill
further
provides
that
all
moneys
15


deposited
are
appropriated
each
fiscal
year
to
the
insurance
16


division
to
be
used
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
the
17


insurance
fraud
bureau.
The
bill
also
removes
IWD’s
authority
18


for
discretionary
spending
of
moneys
in
the
special
fund
for
19


fiscal
year
2018-2019.
20


The
bill
applies
retroactively
to
July
1,
2018.
The
bill
21


takes
effect
upon
enactment.
