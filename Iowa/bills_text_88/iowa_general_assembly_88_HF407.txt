GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
459
(the
“Animal
28


Agriculture
Compliance
Act”)
regulated
by
the
department
of
29


natural
resources
(DNR)
by
establishing
a
moratorium
upon
the
30


construction,
including
expansion,
of
a
confinement
feeding
31


operation
structure
(structure)
such
as
buildings
or
manure
32


storage
structure
associated
with
a
confinement
feeding
33


operation
(operation).
The
degree
of
regulation
is
based
on
34


a
number
of
factors
including
the
date
the
operations
were
35


-3-

established,
the
type
of
structure
being
constructed,
and
1


the
operation’s
size
determined
according
to
its
animal
unit
2


capacity
(AUC).
The
bill
also
requires
DNR
to
establish
3


an
annual
budget
that
provides
for
fully
administering
4


and
enforcing
the
Code
chapter,
including
by
adjusting
the
5


statutory
amount
assessed
for
each
compliance
fee
(fee)
that
is
6


deposited
in
the
animal
agriculture
compliance
fund
(fund).
7


MORATORIUM.
The
moratorium
applies
to
DNR’s
acceptance
or
8


approval
of
applications
for
permits
to
construct
a
structure
9


and
to
the
construction
of
such
structure
(when
concrete
10


is
poured
to
form
its
floor
or
foundation)
regardless
of
11


whether
a
permit
has
been
issued.
A
number
of
exceptions
12


apply,
including
for
operations
having
an
AUC
of
300
or
fewer
13


animal
units,
dry
bedded
confinement
feeding
operations
(where
14


manure
is
stored
as
dry
bedded
manure
rather
than
liquid),
the
15


construction
of
an
egg
washwater
storage
structure,
and
the
16


construction
of
a
structure
pursuant
to
a
variance
granted
by
17


DNR
for
a
replacement
structure
so
long
as
the
operation’s
18


AUC
or
its
manure
storage
capacity
is
not
increased,
and
the
19


structure
provides
a
higher
degree
of
environmental
protection
20


than
the
replaced
structure.
21
