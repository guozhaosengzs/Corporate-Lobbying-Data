The

not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


CURRENT
IOWA
LAW.
Under
current
law,
motor
vehicles
12


designed
to
carry
not
more
than
nine
persons
as
passengers,
13


either
school
owned
or
privately
owned,
are
excluded
from
the
14


definition
of
“school
bus”
under
Code
section
321.1,
thereby
15


excluding
such
vehicles
from
the
duties
and
requirements
16


relating
to
school
buses
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
321
17


(motor
vehicles
and
law
of
the
road).
To
qualify
under
the
18


exclusion,
a
vehicle
must
be
used
to
transport
pupils
to
19


activity
events
in
which
the
pupils
are
participants
or
used
20


to
transport
pupils
to
their
homes
in
case
of
illness
or
other
21


emergency
situations,
and
must
be
operated
by
an
employee
of
22


the
school
district
who
is
specifically
approved
by
the
local
23


superintendent
of
schools
for
the
assignment.
24


Administrative
rules
of
the
department
of
education
regulate
25


type
III
vehicles
used
as
school
buses.
Under
281
IAC
44.2(5),
26


type
III
vehicles
are
not
regular
school
buses
but
are
used
27


to
transport
students
in
a
school-related
context
and
may
28


be
marked
as
a
school
bus.
A
type
III
vehicle
is
a
van
or
29


passenger
car,
including
a
minivan,
sport
utility
vehicle,
or
30


station
wagon.
The
difference
between
a
family
automobile
and
31


an
equivalent
type
III
vehicle
is
not
the
vehicle
itself,
but
32


rather
its
use,
as
type
III
vehicles
are
used
by
schools
for
33


purposes
of
student
transportation.
To
qualify
as
a
type
III
34


vehicle,
the
vehicle
must
carry
a
maximum
of
nine
or
fewer

Under
281
IAC
44.5(1),
vehicles
classified
as
pickups
are
not
2


allowed
to
be
used
for
student
transportation.
All
type
III
3


vehicles
are
prohibited
from
carrying
more
passengers
than
4


there
are
seat
belts
as
installed
by
the
manufacturer
(281
5


IAC
44.5(1)(d)).
In
addition,
trailer
hitches
are
allowed
on
6


type
III
vehicles
in
accordance
with
the
manufacturer’s
rated
7


towing
capacity,
but
students
are
not
allowed
to
be
transported
8


in
the
vehicle
when
the
vehicle
is
being
used
to
tow
(281
IAC
9


44.5(2)(j)).
10


Any
person
who
operates
or
allows
the
operation
of
any
11


vehicle
as
a
school
bus
which
does
not
comply
with
the
12


requirements
provided
by
law
or
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
13


the
department
of
education,
or
for
which
there
is
not
a
valid
14


temporary
certificate
for
operation,
is
guilty
of
a
simple
15


misdemeanor
(Code
section
285.14).
The
department
of
education
16


is
required
to
review
all
transportation
arrangements
when
17


deemed
necessary,
to
disapprove
any
arrangements
that
are
not
18


in
conformity
with
the
law
and
established
standards,
and
to
19


require
the
arrangements
to
be
altered
or
changed
so
that
they
20


do
conform
with
the
law
and
established
standards
(Code
section
21


285.8).
22


CURRENT
FEDERAL
LAW.
49
U.S.C.
§30112(a)(1)
prohibits
the
23


manufacture,
sale,
or
import
of
a
motor
vehicle
that
does
not
24


comply
with
applicable
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
if
the
25


vehicle
was
manufactured
on
or
after
the
date
an
applicable
26


safety
standard
took
effect.
The
provision
does
not
apply
27


after
the
first
purchase
of
the
motor
vehicle
in
good
faith
28


other
than
for
resale.
Therefore,
the
provision
prohibits
the
29


sale
of
a
new
motor
vehicle
for
use
as
a
school
bus
if
the
motor


30


vehicle
does
not
meet
applicable
federal
safety
standards
for
31


school
buses.
Under
federal
law,
a
school
bus
is
a
passenger
32


motor
vehicle
designed
to
carry
a
driver
and
more
than
10
33


passengers
that
is
used
significantly
to
transport
students
to
34


or
from
school
or
an
event
related
to
school.

This
bill
requires
the

2


including

4


is
any
motor
vehicle
designed

5


of
any
kind,
not
to
exceed
2,000
pounds.
The
bill
prohibits
6


the
pickup
from
carrying
more
passengers
than
there
are
safety
7


belts
or
safety
harnesses
in
the
pickup
as
installed
by
the
8


manufacturer,
and
from
operating
while
any

present
9

must
10


comply
with
the
qualification,
licensing,

11

set

(license,
authorization,
and
instruction
requirement),
14


other
than
the
requirement
to
obtain
a
commercial
driver’s
15


license.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
the
rules
must
allow
16


the
board
of
directors
of
a
school
district
to
prohibit
the
use
17


of
pickups
as
school
buses
by
the
school

used
passenger
vans
20


designed
to
carry
not
more
than
12
persons
as
passengers,
21


including
the
driver.
The
bill
requires
the
administrative
22

licensing,
and
instruction
requirements
set
forth
in
Code
29

that
pickups
and
passenger
31


vans
operated
