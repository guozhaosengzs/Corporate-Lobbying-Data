This

17


Asset

is
a

by

19

be
seized
by
the
state
and
sold.
Under
current
law,
20


asset
forfeiture
is
governed
by
Code
chapter
809A.
The
bill
21


repeals
Code
chapter
809A
and
replaces
it
with
new
Code
chapter
22


809B.
Currently
under
Code
chapter
809A,
a
conviction
for
a
23


criminal
offense
is
not
required
for
an
asset
to
be
subject
24


to
forfeiture
for
property
valued
at
$5,000
and
less,
and
25


forfeiture
need

26


the
criminal
statute.
The
bill
provides
that
property
is
not
27


subject
to
forfeiture
until
a
person
has
been
convicted
of
28


a
felony
for
which
forfeiture
is
expressly
authorized
as
a
29


penalty.
30


Under
current
law,
forfeiture
is
provided
as
a

for
31


certain
driving
while
intoxicated
offenses
and
for
violations
32


of
Code
chapters

715A
(forgery
and
33


related
fraudulent
criminal
acts),

than
$10,000
in
market
value,
and
United

totaling
$200
or

2


The
bill
provides
that
a
defendant
is
not
jointly
and
3


severally
liable
for
forfeiture
awards
owed
by
other
4


defendants.
5


The
bill
provides
for
a
proportionality
hearing,
where
6


the
defendant
may
petition
the
court
that
the
forfeiture
is
7


unconstitutionally
excessive.
8


The
bill
requires
law
enforcement
agencies
to
provide
annual
9


reports
to
the
department
of
revenue
regarding
forfeitures
10


completed
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies.
The
bill
requires
11


the
department
of
revenue
to
prepare
an
annual
report
12


aggregating
the
results
and
to
post
the
aggregate
report
on
the
13


department’s
internet
site.
14


The
bill
provides
that
new
Code
chapter
809B
preempts
laws
by
15


county,
city,
township,
and
other
tribal
and
local
governments
16


in
the
state
which
regulate
civil
and
criminal
forfeiture.
17


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes
relating
to
the
repeal
of
18


Code
chapter
809A
and
new
Code
chapter
809B.

bill
applies
to

proceeding
