implemented,
the
appropriation
from
the
general
fund
of
the
1


state
to
the
REAP
fund
is
to
be
reduced
for
each
fiscal
year
by

the
amount
credited
to
the
REAP
fund
from
revenues
generated
by
3


the
constitutional
amendment.

BACKGROUND.
The
constitutional
amendment,
ratified
on
5


November
2,
2010,
dedicates
state
revenue
from
an
increase
in
6


the
state’s
sales
tax
for
deposit
into
a
natural
resources
7


and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund.
Moneys
in
the
fund
cannot
8


be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
protecting
and
enhancing
9


water
quality
and
natural
areas
in
this
state,
including
10


parks,
trails,
and
fish
and
wildlife
habitat,
and
conserving
11


agricultural
soils
in
this
state.
No
revenue
is
credited
to
12


the
natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
until
13


the
state’s
sales
tax
is
increased.
Whenever
the
sales
tax
is
14


increased,
the
amount
generated
by
the
increase,
not
to
exceed
15


three-eighths
of
1
percent
of
the
increase,
is
to
be
credited
16


to
that
trust
fund.
By
statute,
moneys
generated
by
the
17


constitutional
amendment
are
to
be
transferred
to
a
statutory
18


version
of
the
trust
fund
(Code
sections
423.2A,
461.3,
and
19


461.31)
and
13
percent
of
that
revenue
is
to
be
credited
to
the
20


REAP
fund
(Code
section
461.35).
