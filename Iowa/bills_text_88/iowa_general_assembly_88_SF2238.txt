rental
agreement
by
a
tenant
or
failure
to
pay
rent.
The
1


bill
establishes
authority
and
procedures
similar
to
those
2


under
Code
section
562A.24
(uniform
residential
landlord
and
3


tenant
Act)
where
in
the
case
of
a
landlord’s
action
for
4


possession
based
upon
nonpayment
of
the
rent
or
in
an
action
5


for
rent
where
the
tenant
is
in
possession,
the
tenant
may
6


counterclaim
for
an
amount
which
the
tenant
may
recover
under
7


the
rental
agreement
or
Code
chapter
562B.
In
the
event
of
8


such
a
counterclaim,
the
court
from
time
to
time
may
order
the
9


tenant
to
pay
into
court
all
or
part
of
the
rent
accrued
and
10


thereafter
accruing,

due
to
each
11


party.
The
party
to
whom
a
net
amount
is
owed
shall
be
paid
12


first
from
the
money
paid
into
court,
and
the
balance
by
the
13


other
party.
If
rent
does
not
remain
due
after
application
of
14


this
section,
judgment
shall
be
entered
for
the
tenant
in
the
15


action
for
possession.
If
the
defense
or
counterclaim
by
the
16


tenant
is
without
merit
and
is
not
raised
in
good
faith,
the
17


landlord
may
recover
reasonable
attorney
fees.
Additionally,
18


in
an
action
for
rent
where
the
tenant
is
not
in
possession,
19


the
tenant
may
counterclaim
but
is
not
required
to
pay
any
rent
20


into
court.

shall
not
charge
to
the

an

of
27


the

and
the
failure
of
a
tenant
to
28


pay
utility
charges
that
exceed
the
actual
cost
of
the
utility
29


provided
shall
not
be
considered
noncompliance
with
the
rental
30


agreement.
In
addition
to
the
actual
cost
of
the
utility,
the
31


bill
authorizes
a
landlord
that
is
responsible
for
the
payment
32


of
one
or
more
utilities
being
provided
to
the
tenant
to
impose
33


a
