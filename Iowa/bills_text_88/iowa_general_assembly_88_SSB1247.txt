Legislative
intent.

The
legislature
finds
and
declares
all
of
the
following:
7


1.
Iowa’s
communities
are
important
to
the
social
and
8


economic
vitality
of
this
state.
Whether
urban,
suburban,
9


or
rural,
many
communities
are
struggling
to
cope
with
10


dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax
delinquent
11


properties.
12


2.
Citizens
of
Iowa
are
affected
adversely
by
dilapidated,
13


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax
delinquent
properties,
14


including
properties
that
have
been
abandoned
due
to
mortgage
15


foreclosure.
16


3.
Dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
17


properties
impose
significant
costs
on
neighborhoods
and
18


communities
by
lowering
property
values,
increasing
fire
19


and
police
protection
costs,
decreasing
tax
revenues,
and
20


undermining
community
cohesion.
21


4.
There
is
an
overwhelming
public
need
to
confront
the
22


problems
caused
by
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
23


tax-delinquent
properties;
to
return
properties
that
are
in
24


non-revenue-generating,
non-tax-producing
status
to
productive
25


status
in
order
to
revitalize
rural
areas,
provide
affordable
26


housing,
and
attract
new
industry;
and
to
create
jobs
for
the
27


citizens
of
this
state
through
the
establishment
of
new
tools
28


that
enable
communities
to
turn
abandoned
spaces
into
vibrant
29


places.
30


5.
Land
banks
are
one
of
the
tools
that
communities
can
use
31


to
facilitate
the
return
of
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
32


and
tax-delinquent
properties
to
productive
use.
