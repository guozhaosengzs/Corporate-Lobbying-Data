the
10


county

the
greatest
taxable
base
within
the
city.
11

incentives

an
eligible
business

110
percent

the
14


qualifying
wage
threshold
and
the
qualifying
investment
made
in
15


the
rural
community
by
the
eligible
business.
16


The
bill
modifies
the
considerations
made
by
the
economic
17


development
authority
prior
to
providing
assistance
for
18


programs
and
projects
pursuant
to
Code
section
15.335B.

match
as
