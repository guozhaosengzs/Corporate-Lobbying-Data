The
bill
requires
that
the
office
of
driver
services
of
the

department
of
transportation
transmit
to
the
state
registrar
of

voters
(the

person
submitting

an
application
for
a
driver’s
license
or
nonoperator’s
9


identification
card,
or
any
renewal

Current
Code
10


section
321.182
requires
that
an
application
for
a
license
11


or
card
include
an
applicant’s
full
name,
signature,
current
12


mailing
address,

15


an

for
a

is
required
to
provide
proof
16


of
lawful

in
the
United
States.
Also
under
current
17


administrative

a

signature
for
a
driver’s
18


license
or
nonoperator’s
identification
card
application
is
19


required
to
be
captured
electronically.
Under
current
law,
20


a
county
treasurer’s
office
participating
in
county
issuance
21


of
driver’s
licenses
is
required
to
participate
in
voter
22


registration
to
the
same
extent
as
a
license
facility
of
the
23


state
department
of
transportation.
24


The
bill
requires
the
state
registrar
of
voters
to
transmit
25


the
electronic
records
and
electronic
signatures
to
the
county
26


commissioner
of

of
the
county
where
the

The
bill
requires
that
the
county
commissioner
review
28


the
electronic
record
and
any
other
relevant
information
to
29


determine
if
a
person
is
an
eligible
elector.
If
the
county
30


commissioner
determines
a
person
to
be
an
eligible
elector
31


and
the
person
is
not
registered
to
vote
in
the
county,
the
32


county
commissioner
is
required
to
notify
the
person
of
the
33


separate
processes
to
decline
to
register
to
vote
or
to
declare
34


a
political
party
affiliation.

decline
voter
registration
within

days
after
the
county

commissioner
issued
the
notification,
the
bill
provides
that
2


the
electronic
record
and
electronic
signature
shall
constitute
3


a
completed
voter
registration
form
for
that
person
and
the
4


bill
requires
the
county
commissioner
to
register
the
person
to
5


vote
in
that
county
and
send
the
person
an
acknowledgment
as
6


required
by
current
law.
7


The
bill
prohibits
a
county
commissioner
from
adding
a
8


person’s
name
to
a
voter
registration
list
until
at
least
21
9


days
after
the
commissioner
has
issued
notification
to
the
10


person.
The
bill
requires
that
a
county
commissioner
send
an
11


acknowledgment
of
registration
within
seven
business
days
of
12


registering
a
person
under
the
bill.
The
bill
also
provides
13


that
the
electronic
record
and
electronic
signature
of
a
person
14


who
does
not
qualify
as
an
eligible
elector
does
not
constitute
15


a
completed
voter
registration
form.
Under
the
bill,
such
a
16


person
submitting
an
application
for
a
license
or
card
will
not
17


be
subject
to
charges
for
voter
registration
fraud
under
Code
18


section
39A.2
for
submitting
such
an
application.
19


The
bill
also
grants
the
state
voter
registration
commission
20


the
authority
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
and
interpret
the
21


provisions
of
the
bill
relating
to
voter
registration
at
motor
22


vehicle
driver’s
license
stations.
If
interpretive
rulemaking
23


authority
is
clearly
vested
in
the
discretion
of
an
agency
by
24


statute,
the
applicable
judicial
standard
of
review
is
whether
25


the
rules
constitute
an
irrational,
illogical,
or
wholly
26


unjustifiable
interpretation
of
law
by
the
agency
(Code
section
27


17A.19(10)(
l
)).
If
interpretive
rulemaking
authority
is
not
28


clearly
vested
in
the
discretion
of
an
agency,
the
applicable
29


judicial
standard
of
review
is
whether
the
rules
constitute
an
30


erroneous
interpretation
of
law
(Code
section
17A.19(10)(c)).
31


The
bill
makes
changes
to
current
law
related
to
address
32


confidentiality
program
participants
under
Code
chapter
33


9E
by
requiring
the
state
registrar
to
adopt
rules
for
34


administration
of
registration
for
those
participants.
The
35


-10-


LSB
1086XS
(3)

ss/jh


10/

S.F.
56


bill
maintains
current
law
to
allow
for
submission
of
a
paper
1


voter
registration
form
through
driver’s
license
offices.
The
2


bill
specifies
that
a
requirement
that
separate
registration
3


forms
be
signed
by
each
individual
registrant
only
applies
to
4


paper
registration
forms.
Under
the
bill,
driver’s
license
5


offices
are
required
to
transmit
voter
registration
forms
6


to
the
appropriate
county
commissioner
and
to
transmit
all
7


electronic
records
and
electronic
signatures
to
the
state
8


registrar
of
voters.
9


Under
current
law,
the
state
registrar
of
voters
is
10


required
to
establish
rules
regulating
transmission
of
voter
11


registration
forms
from
driver’s
license
stations
and
voter
12


registration
agencies.
Under
the
bill,
such
rules
are
required
13


to
be
established
by
the
state
commission.
14


The
bill
also
allows
for
automatic
voter
registration
15


to
be
completed
based
upon
information
received
from
voter
16


registration
agencies,
including,
under
the
bill,
the
17


department
of
education,
the
board
of
regents
and
each
18


institution
governed
by
the
board
of
regents,
and
other
19


state
offices
that
collect
personal
information
sufficient
to
20


complete
a
voter
registration
application.
21


The
bill
provides
that
the
state
voter
registration
22


commission,
in
cooperation
with
the
department
of
23


transportation
and
voter
registration
agencies,
may
adopt
24


emergency
rules
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
bill.
25


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
26


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
27


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
28


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
29


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
30


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
31


mandate
included
in
the
bill.


32


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
