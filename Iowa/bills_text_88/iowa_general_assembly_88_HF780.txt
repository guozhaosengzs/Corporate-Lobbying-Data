correct

in

in

EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
17


This
bill
changes
certain
procedures
relating
to
abandoned
18


structures
and
abatement.
19


The
current
definition
of
“abandoned”
or
“abandonment”
20


requires
a
property
to
have
been
in
violation
of
a
housing
or
21


building
code
for
at
least
six
months.
The
bill
removes
the
22


time
element
from
the
definition
and
provides
that
the
building
23


can
either
be
vacant
or
occupied
only
by
trespassers.
The
bill
24


also
provides
that
evidence
of
meeting
financial
obligations
in
25


respect
to
the
building
does
not
rebut
a
finding
of
abandonment
26


if
the
property
is
substantially
in
need
of
abatement.
The
27


bill
requires
a
property
to
remain
vacant
for
135
days
before
a
28


person
may
request
a
responsible
building
official
to
inspect
a
29


building
to
determine
whether
it
is
abandoned
and
in
need
of
30


abatement,
but
allows
a
responsible
building
official,
which
31


is
defined
in
the
bill,
to
initiate
an
inspection
at
any
time.
32


The
bill
requires
the
responsible
building
inspector
to
make
an
33


application
to
the
court
for
an
administrative
warrant
to
enter
34


any
building
to
conduct
an
inspection.

The
term
“building”
currently
includes
buildings
and
1


structures
only.
The
bill
adds
mobile
and
manufactured
homes
2


that
have
been
converted
to
real
property
pursuant
to
Code
3


section
435.26.
4


Current
law
relies
on
the
current
definition
of
“abandoned”
5


to
start
the
clock
for
when
a
person
may
file
a
petition
6


for
abatement.
A
hearing
is
required
to
determine
if
the
7


building
is
abandoned
or
is
a
public
nuisance.
Currently,
a
8


petitioner
must
make
service
on
the
building
owner
in
one
of
9


three
methods.
The
bill
provides
that
a
petition
for
abatement
10


may
be
filed
no
sooner
than
the
latter
of
six
months
after
the
11


building
has
become
abandoned
and
30
days
after
the
responsible
12


building
official’s
inspection
findings
have
been
provided
13


to
the
person
requesting
the
inspection,
the
owner
of
the
14


building,
and
all
interested
parties.
The
bill
does
not
allow
15


for
a
personal
judgment
against
any
party
and
requires
the
16


petition
to
be
solely
against
the
interested
persons’
interest
17


in
the
property.
The
bill
includes
additional
methods
of
18


service.
The
bill
allows
a
responsible
building
official’s
19


written
inspection
report
to
be
accepted
as
evidence
in
an
20


evidentiary
hearing
or
motion
in
a
proceeding
under
Code
21


chapter
657A
under
certain
circumstances.
22


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
court
finds
that
a
building
is
23


abandoned,
unless
the
court
order
establishes
otherwise,
the
24


property
is
deemed
continuously
abandoned
from
the
date
the
25


action
is
indexed
pursuant
to
Code
section
617.10.
A
property
26


cannot
be
claimed
as
homestead,
and
a
mortgagor,
or
successor
27


in
interest
of
record,
cannot
reject
a
nonjudicial
foreclosure
28


written
notice
served
on
the
mortgagor,
or
successor
in
29


interest,
after
such
date.


30


Current
law
allows
an
owner
to
collect
reasonable
attorney
31


fees
actually
incurred
from
a
petitioner
if
the
court
32


finds
that
the
building
in
question
is
not
abandoned
or
a
33


public
nuisance.
The
bill
allows

to

An

of

who

pursuant

shall
not

the

may
apply
to
the

for

necessary
to
obtain
the
appropriate
8


authority,
information,
or
instructions
from
or
on

of

the

10


Current

requires
the
court
to
conduct
a

to
offer

mortgagees
of
record,
lienholders
of
record,
or
other
known
12


interested
persons
the
opportunity
to
abate

13


The
bill
eliminates
such
hearing
and
creates
a
new
process
for
14


interested
persons
to
demonstrate
their
intent
and
ability
to
15


abate
the
nuisance
and
act
as

If
the

feasible

The
bill
allows
the
court
to
provide
for
a
higher
24


interest
rate.
If
the
receiver
contemplates
a
transfer
of
the
25


note
and
mortgage,
at
the
time
that
the
receiver
seeks
court
26


authorization
of
the
contemplated
transfer,
the
receiver
must
27


disclose
to
the
mortgagee
the
contemplated
transfer
in
the
28


receiver’s
application
for
approval
of
the
mortgage.
29


The
bill
provides
that
it
is
unlawful,
and
a
receiver
may
be
30


held
liable,
for
actual
damages
for
entering
a
property
that
31


is
not
abandoned
for
purposes
of
trying
to
render
the
property
32


abandoned
by
trying
to
force,
intimidate,
harass,
or
coerce
a
33


lawful
occupant
to
vacate
the
property.
If
a
receiver
enters

makes
a
good-faith
effort
to
comply
with
all
requirements
as
1


detailed
in
the
bill,
and
with
any
applicable
mortgage,
lease,
2


or
other
agreement
related
to
occupancy
of
the
building,
the
3


receiver
is
immune
from
liability.
4


The
bill
makes
an
interested
party
responsible
for
paying
5


the
mortgagee’s
reasonable
costs
and
attorney
fees
if
the
6


interested
party
pays
off
the
receiver’s
mortgage
loan.
7


The
bill
requires
a
receiver
to
pay
a
plaintiff’s
reasonable
8


attorney
fees
in
most
situations,
but
provides
that
a
9


neighboring
landowner
who
pursued
an
action
in
bad
faith
may
10


be
liable
for
attorney
fees.
The
court
may
bar
such
landowner
11


from
filing
further
actions
under
Code
chapter
657A.
12


The
bill
provides
that
a
city
may
petition
the
court
to
enter
13


judgment
awarding
the
city
the
title
to
an
abandoned
property
14


located
in
the
city
if
the
building
has
been
abandoned
for
at
15


least
six
consecutive
months.
Current
law
does
not
require
the
16


building
to
be
abandoned
for
six
consecutive
months.
17


The
bill
provides
that
Code
sections
657A.1A
through
657A.10
18


shall
only
apply
to
cities
and
counties
that
adopt
such
by
19


ordinance.
As
an
alternative
to
the
remedies
in
Code
sections
20


657A.1A
through
657A.10,
the
bill
allows
a
city,
or
a
county
21


that
has
an
alleged
nuisance
property
outside
the
limits
of
a
22


city,
to
petition
the
court
for
an
injunction
that
requires
the
23


property
owner
to
correct
any
conditions
causing
the
property
24


to
be
a
public
nuisance.
25


The
bill
directs
the
Code
editor
to
renumber
new
Code
section
26


657A.10B
as
new
Code
section
657A.10A,
and
to
renumber
current


27


Code
section
657A.10A
as
new
Code
section
657A.10B,
and
to
28


correct
internal
Code
references
as
necessary.
