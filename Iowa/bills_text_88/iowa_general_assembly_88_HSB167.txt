Acts”
(RULONA),
enacted
by
the
general
14


assembly
in

which
is
based
on
a
15


model
Act
proposed
by
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
16


on
uniform
state
laws
(commissioners)
in
2010.
The
Code
17


chapter

a
notarial
act
by
the
secretary

notarial
officer
(a

authorized
individual
such
as
a
20


judge)
who
performs
a
specific
official
act
such
as
attesting
21


to

(2018)”,
by
allowing
a
notary
public
to
perform
32


a
notarial
act
remotely
by
utilizing
