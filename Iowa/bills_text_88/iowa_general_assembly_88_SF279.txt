of

The

19


OVERVIEW.
This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
under
Title
20


V,
subtitle
4,
of
the
Code
regulating
persons
operating
under
21


licenses
issued
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
22


stewardship
(DALS).
The
bill
creates
Code
chapter
204
and
23


authorizes
the
production
of
hemp
under
the
DALS’
regulatory
24


supervision
when
acting
under
the
provisions
of
the
Agriculture
25


Improvement
Act
of
2018,
Pub.
L.
No.
115-334
(2018
Farm
Bill).
26


The
2018
Farm
Bill
defines
hemp
as
a
species
of
Cannabis
having
27


a
maximum
concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
28


that
does
not
exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent.
The
2018
Farm
29


Bill
authorizes
states
to
assume
primary
regulatory
authority
30


over
the
production
of
hemp
by
submitting
a
state
plan
(plan)
31


for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
32


(USDA)
which
has
60
days
to
approve,
disapprove,
or
amend
the
33


plan.
The
2018
Farm
Bill
provides
that
state
regulations
may
34


be
more
but
not
less
stringent
than
the
federal
regulations.

HEMP
LICENSES
AND
FEES.
DALS
is
required
to
accept
and
1


approve
or
disapprove
applications
for
the
issuance
of
a
hemp
2


license
(license)
on
a
one-year
basis
subject
to
renewal.
A
3


license
covers
a
crop
site
which
cannot
exceed
40
contiguous
4


acres.
DALS
may
issue
any
number
of
licenses
to
a
single
5


applicant.
However,
a
person
is
prohibited
from
holding
more
6


than
40
crop
sites
under
all
current
licenses
issued
to
the
7


person.
DALS
must
assess
and
collect
hemp
fees
(fees)
for
the
8


issuance
of
a
license
and
for
an
annual
fall
inspection
until
9


June
30,
2022.
After
that
date,
fees
are
to
be
established
by
10


rule
based
on
the
amount
required
to
administer
and
enforce
the
11


provisions
of
the
bill.
Moneys
collected
from
the
fees
are
to
12


be
deposited
into
a
hemp
fund
(fund)
which
are
appropriated
13


to
DALS
for
purposes
of
administering
and
enforcing
these
14


provisions.
15


REGULATIONS.
DALS
may
adopt
rules
regulating
the
16


production,
handling,
transporting,
or
marketing
of
hemp
which
17


was
produced
on
a
licensee’s
crop
site.
In
addition,
such
hemp
18


is
not
considered
to
be
a
controlled
substance.
Generally,
19


production,
possession,
or
distribution
of
a
controlled
20


substance
is
a
criminal
offense.
The
bill
provides
that
new
21


Code
chapter
204
does
not
prohibit
a
person
from
producing,
22


handling,
transporting,
marketing,
or
processing
a
hemp
23


product.
DALS
is
required
to
conduct
an
annual
inspection
of
a
24


licensee’s
crop
site
and
obtain
a
sample
for
official
testing
25


by
a
laboratory
designated
by
DALS.
In
addition
to
an
annual
26


inspection,
DALS
may
enter
onto
a
crop
site
during
reasonable
27


hours
to
determine
whether
a
licensee
is
acting
in
compliance
28


with
the
bill’s
requirements
and
may
obtain
a
sample
of
the
29


crop
for
official
testing.
30


ENFORCEMENT
AND
PENALTIES.
DALS
may
order
the
disposal
of
31


a
crop
produced
on
a
licensee’s
crop
site
if
official
test
32


results
indicate
that
a
crop
does
not
qualify
as
hemp.
The
33


disposal,
including
the
crop’s
destruction,
must
be
at
the
34


licensee’s
expense.
DALS
may
also
suspend
or
revoke
a
license
