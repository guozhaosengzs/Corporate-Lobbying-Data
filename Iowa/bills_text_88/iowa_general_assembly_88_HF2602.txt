The

of
this

does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
25


Code
chapter
422D
authorizes
counties
to
impose
a
property
26


tax
levy,
an
income
surtax,
or
a
combination
of
both
taxes
27


within
the
county,
excluding
those
areas
within
a
benefited
28


emergency
medical
services
district

Code
chapter
357F,

to
be
used
for

medical
services,
if
the

approved

strikes
the
requirement
for

election
to
32


authorize
the
imposition
of

33


and,
instead,

to
adopt
a
resolution
declaring
emergency
medical

services
to
be
an
essential

within

The
2


bill
establishes
the
procedural
requirement
for
adoption
of

3


resolution
and
provides
that
the
requirements
for
approval
of

the
resolution
or
approval
of

imposition
of
a
tax
shall
not
5


be
suspended
or
waived
by
the
board.
In
addition,
each
county
6


for
which
such
a
resolution
has
been
adopted
shall
coordinate
7


efforts
between
the
county
emergency
management
coordinator
and
8


the
local
emergency
medical
services
agencies
to
establish
a

recently
updated

bill
establishes
annual
emergency
medical

service
assessment
and
reporting
requirements
for
each
county
16


emergency
medical

advisory
council.
17


Code
chapter
422D
currently
provides
that
imposition
of
the
18


taxes
or
combination
of
taxes
is
for
a
maximum
period
of
five
19


years.
The
bill
removes
the
five-year
limitation
and
provides
20


that
discontinuance
of
the
county’s
authority
to
impose
the
21


taxes
is
required
to
be
by
petition
of
eligible
electors
and
22


election.
The
bill
also
specifies
that
a
county
may
not
impose
23


the
taxes
for
any
fiscal
year
or
tax
year,
as
applicable,
24


beginning
after
the
election
approving
the
discontinuance
of
25


authority
unless
subsequently
again
approved
for
imposition.
26


Following
discontinuance
of
authority,
authority
to
reimpose
27


the
taxes
requires
approval
in
accordance
with
Code
section
28


422D.1,
as
amended
in
the
bill.
29


The
bill
also
strikes

limitation
that

30


entering

Code
chapter

agreements
to
ensure
adequate
31


coverage
of

area,
may
