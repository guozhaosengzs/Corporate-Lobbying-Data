Disclosures

telephone
communications
——
legislative
findings
——
2


definitions.

1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
political
telephone
4


communication
is
increasingly
used
in
political
campaigns
in
5


this
state
in
a
deceptive
manner,
including
but
not
limited
6


to
the
use
of
political
telemarketing,
also
known
as
push-
7


polling,
where
an
anonymous
telephone
communication
is
8


designed
to
appear
as
a
legitimate
poll,
but
is
in
fact
used
9


to
communicate
certain
negative
information
related
to
a
10


candidate
or
ballot
issue.
The
general
assembly
declares
that
11


a
compelling
public
interest
exists
to
identify
the
source
of
12


funding
of
telephone
communications
related
to
elections
in
13


order
to
prevent
corruption
and
deceit
at
the
expense
of
the
14


electorate
and
to
preserve
accountability
for
expenditures
made
15


in
connection
with
political
campaigns.

order
to
gauge
public
opinion
concerning
21


a
candidate,
public
office
holder,
or
ballot
issue
that
is
part
22


of
a
series
of
like

that
utilizes
a
23


scientific
sampling
technique
to
produce
a
random
sample
of
24


respondents.

The

in
18


prohibiting
the
use
of
false

of

that
impede

and
