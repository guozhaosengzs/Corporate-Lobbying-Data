Under

Code
section
614.1(12),
a
civil

for
21


damages
for

suffered
as
result
of
sexual

as
22


defined

The

If

before

the

on
the
grounds
that
it
was

the
5


party
shall
have
a
right
to
file
a
revival
action.
6


Under
current
Code
section
614.8,
the
applicable
limitations
7


period
in
which
to
bring
certain
civil
actions
is
extended
for

The
bill
amends
Code
section

to
specify
that
the
17


extension
of
the
limitations
period
for
persons
with
mental
18


illness
and
for
minors
applies
to
claims
brought
pursuant

Code
chapter
670,
which
chapter
is
already
referenced
at
the
20


beginning
of
the
sentences
extending
the
limitations
period.
21


The
amendment
to
Code
section
614.8A
in
the
bill
extends
22


the

The
amendment
also

bill.
If
an
