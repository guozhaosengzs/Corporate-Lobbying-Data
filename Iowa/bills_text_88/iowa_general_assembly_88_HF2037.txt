EXPLANATION
4


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
5


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
6


Current
law
requires
a
bicycle
to
have
a
front
lighted
7


lamp
and
either
a
rear
lighted
lamp
or
a
rear
reflector
at
8


any
time
from
sunset
to
sunrise,
and
at
such
other
times
9


when
conditions
such
as
fog,
snow,
sleet,
or
rain
provide
10


insufficient
lighting
to
render
clearly
discernible
persons
and
11


vehicles
on
the
highway
at
a
distance
of
500
feet
ahead.
This
12


bill
instead
requires
that,
from
sunset
to
sunrise,
a
bicycle
13


must
be
equipped
with
a
lamp
on
the
front
exhibiting
a
steady
14


or
flashing
white
light
visible
from
a
distance
of
at
least
300
15


feet
to
the
front,
and
every
bicycle
or
bicycle
rider
must
be
16


equipped
with
a
lamp
exhibiting
a
steady
or
flashing
red
light
17


visible
from
a
distance
of
300
feet
to
the
rear.
18


The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
of
this
provision
is
$25.
19


However,
the
bill
provides
that
a
citation
issued
for
failure
20


to
have
a
front
or
rear
lamp
on
a
bicycle
or
on
a
bicycle
rider
21


must
first
provide
for
a
72-hour
period
within
which
the
person
22


charged
with
the
violation
can
replace
or
repair
the
lamp.
If
23


the
person
complies
with
the
directive
to
replace
or
repair
the
24


bicycle
lamp,
the
citation
must
be
expunged.
25


The
bill
requires
a
person
riding
a
bicycle
on
a
highway
26


with
a
speed
limit
of
45
miles
per
hour
or
more,
other
than
27


for
the
purpose
of
crossing
the
highway
at
a
crosswalk,
to
28


wear
clothing
and
equipment
which
together
contain
at
least
29


144
square
inches
of
high-visibility
or
reflective
material
30


visible
to
the
rear
of
the
bicycle.
The
scheduled
fine
for
a
31


violation
of
this
provision
is
$25.
The
bill
provides
that
32


the
provision
does
not
apply
to
a
person
riding
a
bicycle
as
33


part
of
an
organized
bicycle
riding
event
involving
500
or
more
34


bicycle
