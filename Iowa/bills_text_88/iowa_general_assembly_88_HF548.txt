EXPLANATION
21


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
22


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
23


Current
Code
section
331.391(4)
provides
that
if
a
region
24


is
meeting
the
financial
obligations
for
implementation
of
25


its
regional
service
system
management
plan
for
a
fiscal
26


year
and
residual
funding
is
anticipated,
the
regional
27


administrator
shall
reserve
an
adequate
amount
of
unobligated
28


and
unencumbered
funds
for
cash
flow
of
expenditure
obligations
29


in
the
next
fiscal
year.
Additionally,
for
fiscal
years
30


beginning
July
1,
2017,
July
1,
2018,
and
July
1,
2019,
that
31


portion
of
each
mental

amount
that
32


exceeds
25
percent
of
the
gross

from
the
combined
33


account
or
from
all

county
accounts
in
the
fiscal
year
34


preceding
the

or
in
part
to
fund
the
payment
of
services
provided
under
the
1


regional
service
system
management
plan.
This
bill
strikes
the
2


requirement
that
those
excess
amounts
be
used
in
that
manner
3


for
those
fiscal
years.
4


Under
current
law,
for
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
5


July
1,
2021,
based
on
certain
population
thresholds,
each
6


region’s
cash
flow
amount
is
limited
to
20
or
25
percent
of
7


the
gross
expenditures
from
the
combined
account
or
from
all
8


separate
county
accounts
under
control
of
the
governing
board
9


for
the
fiscal
year
preceding
the
fiscal
year
in
progress.
The
10


bill
removes
all
population
thresholds
and
limits
each
region’s
11


cash
flow
amount
to
30
percent.
12


The
bill
makes
similar
changes
to
provisions
governing
the
13


cash
flow
amounts
held
and
used
by
individual
counties
within
14


each
region.
The
bill
also
modifies
the
calculation
of
each
15


county’s
cash
flow
reduction
amount
under
Code
section
331.424A
16


for
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2021.
An
amount
17


equal
to
the
county’s
cash
flow
reduction
amount
is
required
18


to
be
used
to
fund
the
county’s
financial
obligations
for
19


the
payment
of
services
provided
under
the
regional
service
20


system
management
plan.
Under
the
bill,
the
county
cash
flow
21


reduction
amount
equals
the
sum
of
the
county’s
cash
flow
22


amount
in
the
county
services
fund
plus
the
most
recent
amount
23


certified
by
the
region
for
the
county,
minus
30
percent
of
the
24


gross
expenditures
from
the
county
services
fund
in
the
fiscal
25


year
preceding
the
fiscal
year
in
progress.
26


The
bill
provides
that
to
the
extent
necessary
to
implement
27


the
provisions
of
the
bill,
a
county
may
amend
that
portion
of
28


the
county’s
budget
related
to
cash
flow
amounts
in
the
county
29


mental
health
and
disability
services
fund
for
the
fiscal
year
30


beginning
July
1,
2018.
The
bill
also
provides
that
if
the
31


bill
takes
effect
on
or
after
March
15,
2019,
notwithstanding
32


Code
section
24.17,
for

a
