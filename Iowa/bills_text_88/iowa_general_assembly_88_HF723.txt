GENERAL
——
LLC
DESCRIPTION.
An
LLC
is
a
type
of
34


unincorporated
business
organization
that
combines
features
35


-43-


LSB
1163HV
(1)
88


da/jh


43/
52



H.F.
723


associated
with
for-profit
corporations
(Code
chapter
490)
and
1


partnerships
(Code
chapter
486A).
When
adequately
capitalized
2


and
operating
pursuant
to
its
operating
agreement,
an
LLC
3


resembles
a
corporation
operating
under
its
articles
of
4


incorporation
and
bylaws,
by
shielding
its
members
(equity
5


holders)
from
the
organization’s
liabilities
(debts).
It
6


also
resembles
a
partnership
in
that
business
income
passes
7


through
the
organization
to
its
members
who
report
their
8


respective
share
of
profits
or
losses
on
individual
rather
9


than
the
organization’s
(corporate)
tax
returns.
An
LLC
10


is
formed
by
filing
a
certificate
of
organization
with
the
11


secretary
of
state
(comparable
to
a
corporation’s
articles
12


of
incorporation),
while
many
of
its
powers
and
duties
are
13


governed
by
contract
(referred
to
as
an
operating
agreement
14


and
generally
comparable
to
a
partnership
agreement).
The
15


operating
agreement
may
control
the
LLC’s
governance
(e.g.,
16


whether
it
is
member-managed
or
manager-managed)
and
the
rights
17


and
duties
of
its
members
and
managers.
A
member’s
interest
18


refers
to
the
member’s
proportionate
equity
position
in
the
LLC
19


and
associated
control
of
its
business
decisions
(affairs
and
20


internal
activities).
A
transferable
interest
refers
to
the
21


right
of
a
member
or
former
member
to
receive
distributions
22


from
the
LLC
in
accordance
with
the
LLC’s
operating
agreement.
23


Absent
a
provision
in
the
operating
agreement
to
the
contrary,
24


a
transferable
interest
does
not
include
a
unilateral
25


transfer
of
control
rights.
Dissociation
occurs
when
a
member
26


withdraws
from
an
LLC
which
may
be
on
either
a
voluntary
or
an
27


involuntary
basis.
28


GENERAL
——
IOWA
SERIES
(ARTICLE
12).
Under
Code
chapter
489,
29


article
12,
an
LLC’s
operating
agreement
may
provide
for
the
30


establishment
of
a
designated
series.
Under
this
arrangement,
31


an
LLC
acts
as
an
umbrella
organization
for
any
number
of
32


segregated
transferable
interests.
The
term
commonly
used
to
33


describe
the
umbrella
organization
is
a
series
LLC.
So
long
34


as
certain
conditions
are
satisfied,
the
liabilities
(e.g.,
35


-44-


LSB
1163HV
(1)
88


da/jh


44/
52



H.F.
723


debts)
and
obligations
(e.g.,
contractual
promises)
by
one
1


series
cannot
be
imputed
to
either
the
series
LLC
or
another
2


series
under
its
umbrella
(Code
section
489.1201).
Likewise,
3


as
far
as
income,
any
gain
or
loss
of
a
series
may
be
allocated
4


directly
to
the
members
of
the
series
rather
than
to
the
series
5


LLC
or
another
series.
Because
a
series
is
a
component
of
a
6


series
LLC
it
cannot
be
completely
independent.
The
article
7


includes
special
provisions
for
a
series
LLC,
including
for
its
8


formation
(Code
section
489.1201),
management
(Code
section
9


489.1202),
distributions
conducted
as
part
of
a
dissolution
10


(Code
section
489.1203),
a
member’s
dissociation
(Code
section
11


489.1204),
its
termination
(Code
section
489.1205),
and
a
12


foreign
series
LLC
(Code
section
489.1206).
13


DIVISION
I
——
UNIFORM
PROTECTED
SERIES
ACT
——
GENERAL.
14


Division
I
enacts
the
UPSA
adopted
by
the
ULC
which
in
time
15


will
entirely
replace
current
article
12.
The
provisions
of
16


the
UPSA
are
codified
and
fit
within
the
other
provisions
of
17


the
RULLCA.
The
article
as
amended
contains
two
parts:
part
1
18


includes
the
sections
of
the
UPSA
taking
the
place
of
current
19


Iowa
series
LLC
sections
and
part
2
includes
the
current
Iowa
20


series
sections
temporarily
transferred
to
another
part
of
21


article
12
until
repealed
on
January
1,
2021.
22


PART
1,
SUBPART
A
——
GENERAL
PROVISIONS.
This
subpart
23


includes
definitions,
a
description
of
the
nature
of
a
24


protected
series;
its
power,
purpose,
and
duration;
how
the
25


protected
series
is
governed
by
the
LLC’s
operating
agreement;
26


and
rules
for
applying
certain
provisions
of
an
existing
LLC
to
27


a
protected
series.
Specifically,
it
includes
the
article’s
28


short
title
(new
Code
section
489.12101),
describes
terms
used
29


in
the
article
(new
Code
sections
489.12102
and
489.12103),
30


including
defining
“protected
series”
which
replaces
the
term
31


“series”
(new
Code
section
489.12102(18)).
It
defines
“series
32


limited
liability
company”
to
mean
a
LLC
that
has
at
least
one
33


protected
series
(or
is
structured
to
have
a
protected
series)
34


under
its
umbrella
(new
Code
section
489.12102(12)).
The
bill
35


-45-


LSB
1163HV
(1)
88


da/jh


45/
52



H.F.
723


defines
a
number
of
other
terms
such
as
“asset”
which
includes
1


property
in
which
a
series
LLC
or
protected
series
holds
title
2


and
therefore
may
exercise
certain
rights
including
transfer
3


(new
Code
section
489.12102(1)).
An
“associated
asset”
of
a
4


series
LLC
belongs
only
to
(i.e.,
is
“associated
with”)
the
5


series
LLC
and
an
“associated
asset”
of
a
protected
series
6


belongs
only
to
(i.e.,
is
“associated
with”)
that
protected
7


series
(new
Code
sections
489.12102(2)
and
489.12301(1)).
8


A
“protected-series
transferable
interest”
is
a
type
of
9


transferable
interest
in
which
an
associated
member
has
a
10


right
to
receive
a
distribution
(share
of
an
asset)
from
a
11


protected
series
under
an
operating
agreement
(Code
section
12


489.12101(10)).
A
“protected-series
manager”
(new
Code
section
13


489.12102(9))
is
a
type
of
manager
(Code
section
489.102)
who
14


exercises
all
powers
necessary
to
direct
the
activities
and
15


affairs
of
the
protected
series
(Code
section
489.12102(9)).
A
16


protected
series
may
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
own
name
(new
Code
17


section
489.12104(1))
and
has
the
same
powers
and
purposes
as
18


the
series
LLC
(new
Code
section
489.12104(2)).
Generally,
a
19


protected
series
cannot
survive
the
termination
of
its
umbrella
20


series
(new
Code
section
489.12104(3)).
A
protected
series
21


cannot
be
a
member
of
another
series
LLC
or
establish
another
22


protected
series
(new
Code
section
489.12104(4)).
A
protected
23


series
is
subject
to
choice
of
law
rules
in
cases
where
a
24


dispute
arises
between
parties
from
different
states
(new
Code
25


section
489.12105).
A
series
LLC
is
governed
by
an
operating
26


agreement
(new
Code
section
489.12106).
In
certain
cases,
27


the
UPSA
controls
the
series
LLC
and
any
protected
series
28


regardless
of
the
terms
of
an
operating
agreement
(new
Code
29


section
489.12107(1)).
Various
provisions
govern
how
the
UPSA
30


and
the
RULLCA
are
to
be
interpreted
in
harmony.
31


PART
1,
SUBPART
B
——
ESTABLISHING
PROTECTED
SERIES.
This


32


subpart
provides
for
how
a
protected
series
is
established.
33


First,
it
requires
a
vote
of
the
series
LLC’s
membership
(new
34


Code
section
489.12201(1)).
A
protected
series
designation
35


-46-


LSB

H.F.
723


must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
(new
Code
section
1


489.12201(2)).
The
name
of
a
protected
series
must
comply
with
2


the
naming
conventions
applicable
to
an
ordinary
LLC
but
have
3


a
“protected
series”
or
“PS”
designation
(new
Code
section
4


489.12202).
A
series
LLC
(acting
through
its
own
registered
5


agent)
serves
as
the
recipient
for
service
for
all
its
umbrella
6


protected
series
(new
Code
section
489.12203(1)).
A
number
7


of
provisions
govern
how
a
protected
series
receives
service
8


of
process
(new
Code
sections
489.12203
and
489.12204).
A
9


protected
series
may
obtain
a
certificate
of
existence
from
10


the
secretary
of
state
(new
Code
section
489.12205).
An
LLC
11


is
required
to
file
a
biennial
report
with
the
secretary
of
12


state
under
Code
section
489.209.
The
report
must
include
13


information
regarding
its
series
(new
Code
section
489.12206).
14


PART
1,
SUBPART
C
——
ASSETS,
MEMBERS,
MANAGEMENT,
AND
15


INFORMATION.
Unless
provided
otherwise
in
an
operating
16


agreement,
the
owner
of
an
asset
is
responsible
for
meeting
17


the
record-keeping
requirements
for
that
asset.
An
asset
18


is
only
associated
with
a
protected
series
or
series
LLC
19


if
there
are
adequate
records
describing
the
asset
(new
20


Code
section
489.12301(2)).
Only
a
member
of
a
series
LLC
21


may
be
an
associated
member
of
a
protected
series
holding
22


a
transferrable
interest
in
the
protected
series
(new
Code
23


section
489.12302(1)).
A
transferable
interest
in
a
protected
24


series
must
initially
be
owned
either
by
the
series
LLC
or
25


by
an
associated
member
of
the
protected
series
(new
Code
26


section
489.12303(1)).
A
protected
series
may
have
multiple
27


managers
(new
Code
section
489.12304(1))
in
the
same
manner
as
28


an
ordinary
LLC
under
Code
section
489.407.
A
manager
of
a
29


protected
series
owes
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
protected
series
30


rather
than
to
the
series
LLC
or
any
other
protected
series
31


unless
the
manager
also
manages
that
protected
series
(new
32


Code
section
489.12304(4)).
Any
derivative
claim
under
RULLCA
33


(article
9)
applies
to
such
claim
brought
against
a
protected
34


series
(Code
section
489.12304(6)).
The
bill
does
not
include
35


-47-

H.F.

a
provision
in
the
UPSA
that
states
an
associated
member
of
a
1


protected
series
has
the
same
power
to
act
as
an
agent
and
may
2


bind
the
protected
series
in
the
same
manner
as
a
member
of
3


an
ordinary
LLC
(presumably
member-managed
under
Code
section
4


489.407).
Various
parties
have
a
limited
right
to
acquire
5


information
regarding
a
protected
series,
including
a
member
6


of
the
series
LLC,
a
former
associated
member
of
a
protected
7


series,
the
legal
representative
of
an
associated
member
of
a
8


protected
series,
and
a
protected-series
manager
of
a
protected
9


series
(new
Code
section
489.12305).
10


PART
1,
SUBPART
D
——
LIABILITY
LIMITATIONS
AND
CLAIMS.
11


This
subpart
limits
the
liability
of
certain
persons
and
the
12


enforcement
of
claims,
by
creating
two
types
of
liability
13


shields:
vertical
and
horizontal.
A
vertical
shield
applies
14


to
members
and
managers
from
liability
in
the
same
manner
as
15


an
ordinary
LLC.
A
horizontal
shield
applies
to
a
protected
16


series
of
a
series
LLC
and
its
associated
assets
from
liability
17


for
the
debts
or
obligations
of
the
series
LLC
or
another
18


protected
series.
A
person
is
not
liable
for
the
debts
and
19


obligations
of
a
protected
series
or
a
series
LLC
solely
20


because
the
person
is
an
associated
member,
protected-series
21


manager,
or
protected-series
transferee
of
a
protected
series
22


(new
Code
section
489.12401(1)).
However,
notwithstanding
23


these
shields,
a
claimant
could
bring
an
action
against
a
24


protected
series
under
certain
circumstances
if
the
same
25


action
could
be
brought
against
an
ordinary
LLC
(new
Code
26


section
489.12402(1)).
Remedies
afforded
a
judgment
creditor
27


of
an
associated
member,
protected-series
transferee,
or
28


series
limited
liability
company
holding
a
protected-series
29


transferable
interest
are
the
same
as
afforded
to
a
judgment
30


creditor
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
LLC
under
Code
section
31


489.503
(new
Code
section
489.12403).
Creditors
are
provided
32


different
rights
to
assets
if
they
are
asserting
a
claim
to
33


pierce
the
organization’s
veil

Code
section
489.12404).

PART
1,
SUBPART
E
——
DISSOLUTION
AND
WINDING
UP
AFFAIRS.
3


If
a
series
LLC
dissolves
then
each
protected
series
under
4


its
umbrella
dissolves
simultaneously
(new
Code
section
5


489.12501(1)).
The
dissolution
of
a
protected
series
occurs
6


due
to
a
provision
in
its
operating
agreement,
the
unanimous
7


action
of
its
members,
or
pursuant
to
court
order
(new
Code
8


section
489.12501(2)-(5)).
Once
the
protected
series
is
to
be
9


dissolved,
its
activities
and
affairs
are
to
be
wound
up
in
the
10


same
manner
as
an
ordinary
LLC
(new
Code
section
489.12502(1))
11


referring
to
Code
sections
489.702
through
489.704.
In
the
12


case
of
the
dissolution
of
a
series
LLC,
it
cannot
wind
up
13


until
each
of
its
protected
series
has
wound
up
(new
Code
14


section
489.12502(4)).
If
a
series
LLC
is
administratively
15


dissolved
by
the
secretary
of
state,
and
later
reinstated,
16


its
protected
series
ceases
winding
up
(new
Code
section
17


489.12503).
18


PART
1,
SUBPART
F
——
CHANGING
TRANSACTIONS.
This
subpart
19


restricts
mergers
and
other
changing
transactions
involving
20


LLCs
and
protected
series.
A
number
of
new
definitions
apply.
21


A
“continuing
protected
series”
refers
to
a
protected
series
22


that
continues
as
part
of
the
surviving
series
LLC
(new
Code
23


section
489.12601(3)).
A
“relocated
protected
series”
refers
24


to
a
protected
series
which
was
part
of
a
nonsurviving
series
25


LLC
and
becomes
part
of
the
surviving
series
LLC
(new
Code
26


section
489.12601(6)).
A
protected
series
is
prohibited
from
27


being
a
direct
party
to
an
acquisition,
conversion,
or
merger
28


(new
Code
section
489.12602(1)).
It
also
cannot
be
a
direct
29


party
to
a
domestication
(a
business
organization
formed
in
30


multiple
states)
(new
Code
section
489.12602(2)).
One
type
of
31


allowed
merger
involves
two
existing
LLCs,
even
if
one
LLC
is
32


not
a
series
LLC
(new
Code
sections
489.12603
and
489.12604).
33


A
plan
of
merger
must
comply
with
the
same
requirements
34


applicable
to
an
ordinary
LLC
under
Code
sections
489.1001

through
489.1005
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
requirements
1


stated
in
a
plan
of
merger
(new
Code
section
489.12605)
and
2


articles
of
merger
(new
Code
section
489.12606).
A
plan
of
3


merger
sets
forth
the
management
and
affairs
or
affairs
of
the
4


protected
series,
including
its
termination,
establishment,
or
5


relocation,
assets
and
liabilities,
powers
and
rights,
and
name
6


(new
Code
section
489.12607).
Generally,
a
creditor
that
has
a
7


right
against
an
LLC
or
protected
series
that
was
terminated
8


because
of
a
merger
may
retain
rights
against
the
surviving
9


series
LLC
or
protected
series
(new
Code
section
489.12608(1)).
10


In
other
cases,
a
creditor’s
rights
are
not
affected
so
long
as
11


the
liability
was
incurred
after
the
merger
(new
Code
section
12


489.12608(3)).
13


PART
1,
SUBPART
G
——
FOREIGN
PROTECTED
SERIES.
The
law
where
14


a
foreign
(out-of-state)
series
LLC
is
created
(referred
to
as
15


the
“law
of
the
jurisdiction
of
formation”)
generally
governs
16


its
protected
series,
including
its
formation
and
governance,
17


as
well
as
the
rights
and
duties
of
its
associated
members,
18


protected
series
managers,
or
protected-series
transferees
19


(new
Code
section
489.12701(1)).
A
foreign
protected
series
20


doing
business
in
another
state
cannot
assert
that
its
law
21


governs
another
foreign
protected
series
not
doing
business
22


in
that
state
(new
Code
section
489.12702).
Generally,
a
23


foreign
protected
series
is
to
be
treated
like
a
foreign
LLC
24


for
purposes
of
registering
to
do
in-state
business
(new
Code
25


section
489.12703).
In
the
case
of
litigation,
within
30
days
26


after
becoming
a
party,
a
foreign
series
LLC
or
a
foreign
27


protected
series
must
disclose
to
any
adverse
party
identifying
28


information
regarding
the
foreign
series
LLC
and
each
of
its
29


foreign
series
(new
Code
section
489.12704(1)).
30


PART
1,
SUBPART
H
——
TRANSITIONAL
PROVISIONS.
This
subpart
31


does
not
include
two
sections
of
the
UPSA
that
are
already
32


included
in
Code
chapter
489,
article
13,
including
section
33


801
that
addresses
uniformity
of
application
(Code
section
34


489.1301)
and
section
802
that

Signatures
in
Global

Commerce
Act
(Code
section

489.1302).
It
also
does
not
include
a
severability
clause
2


(that
would
provide
for
the
retention
of
other
provisions
3


in
the
part
if
one
provision
were
held
invalid)
since
that
4


provision
already
applies
throughout
the
Code
(Code
section
5


4.12).
6


The
provisions
of
UPSA,
codified
as
new
sections
in
article
7


12,
part
1,
take
effect
on
January
1,
2020,
and
applies
only
8


to
a
series
LLC
formed
or
a
protected
series
established
on
or
9


after
that
date.
One
exception
applies
if
a
series
LLC
formed
10


prior
to
that
date
elects
to
be
governed
under
the
new
part
11


(new
Code
section
489.12803(1)).
Otherwise
on
or
after
January
12


1,
2021,
all
series
LLCs
and
each
protected
series
are
governed
13


under
the
new
part
(new
Code
section
489.12803(1)).
However,
14


until
January
1,
2021,
certain
claims
authorized
under
new
15


Code
sections
489.12402
and
489.12404
cannot
proceed
against
a
16


foreign
series
LLC
formed
prior
to
January
1,
2020,
or
foreign
17


LLC
series
that
became
a
foreign
series
before
that
date
(new
18


Code
section
489.12803(4)).
19


DIVISION
II
——
UNIFORM
PROTECTED
SERIES
ACT
——
CONFORMING
20


AMENDMENTS.
The
bill
amends
the
sections
currently
codified
21


in
article
12
(Iowa
series)
to
provide
for
their
repeal
on
22


January
1,
2021,
the
date
when
all
series
LLC
and
umbrella
23


series
must
comply
with
the
new
Code
sections
codified
in
24


part
1
(UPSA).
It
also
provides
for
the
transfer
of
current
25


sections
to
new
part
2.
It
amends
other
provisions
in
the
26


Code
to
conform
with
part
1,
including
sections
that
restrict
27


agricultural
landholding
by
LLCs
(Code
chapter
10).
It
also
28


amends
provisions
relating
to
the
law
governing
foreign
LLCs
by
29


referencing
foreign
series
LLCs
(Code
section
489.801).
The
30


division
takes
effect
January
1,
2020.
31


DIVISION
III
——
DISASSOCIATION
——
MANAGEMENT.
The
bill


32


eliminates
a
provision
which
provides
for
member-managed
33


limited
liability
companies,
by
removing
a
reference
to
34


approving
a
merger,
conversion,
or
domestication
(Code
section
35


-51-


LSB
1163HV
(1)
88


da/jh

H.F.

489.407(2)(f)).
There
are
two
different
methods
of
managing
1


a
LLC.
By
statutory
default
(Code
section
489.407(1)),
a
2


LLC
is
member-managed,
meaning
that
all
members
participate
3


in
decisions
managing
the
activities
and
affairs
to
the
4


organization
(a
partnership
model).
Alternatively,
a
5


manager-managed
LLC,
formed
and
governed
under
an
operating
6


agreement,
provides
that
certain
members
or
nonmembers
are
7


designated
to
take
such
actions
while
the
remaining
members
act
8


as
passive
investors
(corporate
model).
9


DIVISION
IV
——
DISSOLUTION.
The
bill
provides
that
an
LLC
10


may
rescind
a
voluntary
dissolution
(new
Code
section
489.701A)
11


and
consequently
the
winding
up
of
its
affairs
and
activities
12


(Code
section
489.702).
A
dissolution
is
a
fundamental
13


change
transaction
that
triggers
the
LLC’s
termination.
It
is
14


accomplished
by
a
provision
in
the
operating
agreement,
the
15


unanimous
consent
of
its
members,
by
district
court
order
in
16


an
action
for
dissolution,
or
by
an
administrative
declaration
17


issued
by
the
secretary
of
state
(e.g.,
for
nonpayment
of
18


a
fee).
The
bill
provides
that
in
cases
of
a
voluntary
19


dissolution
in
which
a
statement
of
dissolution
is
filed,
an
20


LLC
may
rescind
such
a
statement
by
filing
with
the
secretary
21


of
state
a
statement
of
rescission.
Generally,
once
an
LLC
22


rescinds
its
dissolution,
the
LLC
carries
on
its
affairs
as
if
23


the
dissolution
had
never
occurred.
One
exception
applies
to
24


protect
a
person
(creditor)
who
would
be
adversely
affected
by
25


the
retroactive
effect
of
the
statement
of
rescission.
