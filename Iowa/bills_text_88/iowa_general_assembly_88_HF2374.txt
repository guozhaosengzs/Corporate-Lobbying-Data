This

in

that,
if

punishable
as
a

Code
chapters.
Code

28


or

rescuing
a

arising
from
that
proceeding;
or
31


providing

professional
discipline

the
Iowa
34


veterinary
board
for
taking
action
that

10


animals
declared
to
be

the
animal.
Code
chapter
717D
also
applies
to
any
18


nonhuman
vertebrate
animal
without
exception
and
the
