The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
provides
that
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
unpaid
3


time
off
from
work
to
attend
a
presidential
precinct
caucus
4


for
up
to
four
hours
beginning
one
hour
prior
to
the
start
5


of
the
precinct
caucus.
The
bill
provides
that
the
employee
6


shall
make
a
written
application
with
their
employer
for
such
7


absence
two
weeks
prior
to
the
caucus
and
the
employee
is
not
8


liable
for
any
penalty
nor
shall
any
deduction
be
made
from
the
9


person’s
regular
salary
or
wages
except
for
the
period
of
time
10


of
the
absence.
11


The
bill
provides
that
the
requirement
to
allow
time
off
12


does
not
apply
if
the
person
is
employed
in
a
position
that
13


affects
the
protection
of
public
health
or
safety
or
by
an
14


entity
that
would
experience
severe
economic
disruption
due
15


to
the
person’s
absence.
Such
employer
must
file
a
written
16


notice
with
the
county
commissioner
of
elections
specifying
the
17


exigent
circumstances
justifying
the
denial
of
such
leave
and
18


the
minimum
number
of
persons
needed,
by
position,
to
protect
19


public
health
and
safety
or
maintain
minimum
operational
20


capacity,
and
that
the
number
of
persons
not
applying
for
leave
21


is
less
than
the
minimum
number
specified
by
the
employer.
22


The
denial
of
leave
for
those
number
of
persons
needed
to
23


reach
the
minimum
staffing
number
specified
must
be
done
in
a
24


nondiscriminatory
manner.
25


The
bill
also
permits
an
employer,
in
lieu
of
providing
26


unpaid
leave,
to
provide
paid
leave
for
the
absence
or
to
allow
27


affected
employees
the
option
to
work
the
hours
of
the
absence
28


at
another
time
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law
so
long
as
29


either
option
is
made
available
to
all
affected
employees.
30


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
who
denies
an
employee
31


the
privilege
conferred
by
this
bill
to
attend
a
presidential
32


precinct
caucus
commits
election
misconduct
in
the
fourth
33


degree,
a
simple
misdemeanor.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
34


punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
