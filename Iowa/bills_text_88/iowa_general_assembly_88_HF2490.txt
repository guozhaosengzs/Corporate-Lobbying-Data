A
BILL
FOR


An
Act
requiring
the
director
of
the
department
of
education
to
1


establish
a
low-income
student
and
poverty
weighting
work
2


group.

ENACTED

Section
1.
POVERTY
WEIGHTING
WORK
GROUP.
1


1.
School
funding
in
Iowa
has
not
evolved
as
the
2


demographics
of
Iowa
students
have
changed
significantly,
with
3


little
funding
formula
attention
in
Iowa’s
system
targeted
4


to
supporting
socioeconomically
disadvantaged
students.
In
5


order
to
meet
the
needs
of
such
students
and
to
ensure
access
6


to
the
same
opportunities
that
economically
advantaged
school
7


districts
offer,
school
districts
with
higher
percentages
of
8


students
in
poverty
in
successful
schools
across
the
nation
9


spend
more
per
pupil
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
students’
10


increased
needs
as
compared
to
economically
advantaged
school
11


districts.
Children
from
economically
disadvantaged
homes
12


often
enter
school
with
a
more
limited
vocabulary
and
fewer
13


educational
life
experiences
than
those
from
economically
14


advantaged
homes.
According
to
the
child
and
family
policy
15


center,
children
living
in
poverty
are
more
likely
than
16


their
peers
to
experience
stress
and
deprivation
that
hinders
17


development
and
readiness
for
school
and
life.
Significant
18


levels
of
poverty
exist
in
all
ninety-nine
counties
of
this
19


state
and,
therefore,
the
general
assembly
should
consider
20


additional
ways
to
close
the
opportunity
gap
within
the
funding
21


formula.
22


2.
According
to
the
2019
condition
of
education
annual
23


report,
forty-three
percent
of
Iowa
students
are
eligible
24


for
free
and
reduced
price
meals
under
the
federal
National
25


School
Lunch
Act
and
the
federal
Child
Nutrition
Act
of
1966,
26


42
U.S.C.
§1751-1785,
the
most
widely
used
measure
of
student
27


poverty,
including
within
Iowa’s
methodology
for
funding
28


at-risk
programs.

3.
The
school
finance
formula
review
committee
established
30


under
section
257.1,
subsection
4,
met
on
December
13,
2019,


31


and
recommended
to
the
general
assembly
the
creation
of
a
32


poverty
weighting
study
committee.
33


4.
The
director
of
the
department
of
education
shall
34


establish
and
appoint

impact
of
student
poverty
on
Iowa
students’
success,
including
1


relative
concentration
of
poverty
in
school
districts
and
2


alternative
methodologies
demonstrated
to
provide
supports
3


necessary
to
close
the
opportunity
gap,
including
examination
4


of
relevant
studies
and
testimony
of
relevant
experts.
The
5


work
group
shall
also
determine
if
the
current
methodology
6


effectively
measures
the
needs
of
low-income
students
and
shall
7


make
recommendations
for
funding
methodologies
to
provide
8


additional
funding
required

school
districts
to
provide
the
9


supports
necessary

deliver
successful
outcomes
for
students
10


from
low-income
