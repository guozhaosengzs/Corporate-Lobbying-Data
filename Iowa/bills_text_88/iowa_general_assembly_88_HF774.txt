traffic-control
signal
shall
comply
with
the
generally

shall
verify
its
internal
32


calibrations
no

frequently
than
is
recommended
by
33


the

internal
calibration,
a
calibration
shall
be
conducted
by
a
2


person
trained
in
the
calibration
of
the
system
at

once
3


every
three
months,
which
calibration
may
be

i.
Prior
to
a
local

the
local
authority
10


shall
obtain
approval

A
local
authority

to
the
department
any
information
requested
by
13


the
department
during
the
approval
process.
If
the
local
14


authority’s
use
of
the
system
is
approved
by
the
department,
15


the
local
authority
shall
follow
the
requirements
set
forth
16


in
rules
adopted
by
the
department.
The
department
may
adopt
17

18


systems
to
the
extent
necessary
to
ensure
automated
traffic
19


law
enforcement
systems
are
operated
in
a
safe

20


manner.
The
department
shall
have
the
authority
to
annually
21


review
all
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems
placed
on
22


primary

not
apply
24


to
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system

A
local
authority
may
continue
26


to
operate
such
a
system
in
the
same
manner
as
the
system
27


was
operated
prior
to
January
1,
2020.
However,
on
or
after
28


January
1,
2020,
when
a
local
authority
discontinues
operation
29


of
such
a
system,
any
new
manner
of
operation
or
new
system
30


operated
by
the
local
authority
on
a
primary
road
shall
comply
31


with
this

issued
through
the
use
of
an
34


automated
traffic

adopted
by
the
local
authority
to
review
3


citations
issued
through
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
4


enforcement
systems.
If
a
person
appeals
in
this
manner,
the
5


decision
resulting
from
the
administrative
process
shall
serve
6


as
a
determination
of
liability
owed
to
the
local
authority
7


without
the
need
for
any
other
municipal
or
civil
infraction
8


proceedings.
9


(b)
An
appeal
to
the
district
court,
sitting
in
small
10

of
the
county
in
which
the
local
authority
is
located.

person
may
appeal
a
citation
as
provided

reasonable
period
of
time
of
the
13


citation
being
issued
as
set
forth

local
authority
by
14


ordinance.
If
a
person
does
not
appeal
the
citation
within
15


the
required
period
of
time,
the
citation
shall
serve
as
16


a

any
other
municipal
or

15


permanent

SYSTEM
CALIBRATIONS.
The
bill
requires
a
system
working
10


in
conjunction
with
a
speed
measuring
device
or
official
11


traffic-control
signal
to
comply
with
the
generally
accepted
12


procedures
for
operating
the
system.
A
system
must
verify
its
13


internal
calibrations
no
less
frequently
than
is
recommended
14


by
the
system’s
manufacturer.
If
an
internal
calibration
is
15


not
valid,
the
bill
prohibits
a
system
from
operating
until
a
16


successful
calibration
is
subsequently
conducted.
17


The
bill
also
requires
a
calibration
to
be
conducted
by
a
18


person
trained

the
calibration
of
the
system
at
least
once
19


every
three
months,
and
for
a
mobile
system,
prior
to
the
use
20


of
the
mobile
system
after
any
change
in
location.
A
local
21


authority,
or
another
entity
on
a
local
authority’s
behalf,
22


must
maintain
an
annual
log
of
the
calibrations.
The
log
and
23


documentation
of
the
calibrations
is
admissible
in
any
court
24


proceeding
relating
to
an
official
traffic-control
signal
25


violation
or
a
speed
limit
violation.
26


RECORDS
AND
REPORTS.
The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
27


to

records
relating

for
all
29


locations
at

the
local
authority,
or
another
entity
on
30


a
local
authority’s
behalf,
operates
or
intends
to
operate
a
31


system.
Such
records
must
be
compiled
and
maintained
by
the
32


local
authority
for
one
year
prior
to
the
installation
of
the
33


system

The

SYSTEMS
ON

8


placing

primary
road,
the
local
authority
must
9


obtain

from
the
DOT.
A
local
authority
must
submit
10


to
the
DOT
any
information
requested
by
the
DOT
during
the
11


approval
process.
If
the
local
authority’s
use
of
the
system
12


is
approved
by
the
DOT,
the
local
authority
must
follow
the
13


requirements
set
forth
in
rules
adopted
by
the
DOT.
The
bill
14


authorizes
the
DOT
to
annually
review
all
systems
placed
15


on
primary
roads
and
allows
the
DOT
to
require
removal
or
16


modification
of
such
systems.
These
provisions
do
not
apply
17


to
a
system
in
operation
prior
to
January

2020.
A
local
18


authority
may
continue
to
operate
such
a
system
in
the
same
19


manner
as
the
system
was
operated
prior
to
January
1,
2020.
20


However,
on
or
after
January
1,
2020,
when
a
local
authority
21


discontinues
operation
of
such
a
system,
any
new
manner
of
22


operation
or
new
system
operated
by
the
local
authority
on
a
23


primary
road
must
comply.
24


APPEALS.
The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
to
designate
a
25


process
by
which
a
person
may
appeal
a
citation
issued
through
26


the
use
of
a
system,
which
at
a
minimum
must
provide
for
either
27


an
appeal
by
an
administrative
process
created
by
ordinance
28


adopted
by
the
local
authority
or
an
appeal
to
the
district

sitting
in
small

of
the
county
in
which
the
30


local
authority
is
located.

and
requires
the
DOT
to
notify
a
local
33


authority
