It
also
provides
that
2


the
statement
must
be
included
in
the

14


CAFOs
——
REPORTING.
The
bill
provides
that
for
purposes
15


of
administering
and
enforcing
Code
chapter
459,
subchapter
16


II,
relating
to
air
quality
and
Code
chapter
459,
subchapter
17


III,
relating
to
water
quality,
DNR
may
require
that
the
owner
18


or
operator
of
a
CAFO
submit
one
or
more
animals
confined
19


reports
that
contain
information
regarding
the
number
of
20


animals
maintained
at
the
operation
in
a
manner
and
during
21


a
time
period
that
DNR
determines
is
relevant.
The
report
22


must
present
the
information
in
a
manner
that
calculates
the
23


number
of
animals
maintained
as
animal
units
(AU).
The
bill
24


authorizes
DNR
to
require
a
report
as
part
of
a
construction
25


permit
to
expand
a
structure.
The
owner
or
operator
of
the
26


CAFO
must
also
report
to
DNR
the
number
of
animals
maintained
27


as
part
of
the
operation
converted
to
animal
units.
A
CAFO’s
28


size
is
determined
by
calculating
its
AU
capacity.
A
special
29


equivalency
factor
is
assigned
for
each
classification
of
30


confined
animal.
For
example,
each
butcher
or
breeding
swine
31


weighing
more
than
55
pounds
has
an
equivalency
factor
of
0.4
32


AUs.
The
permit
requirement
threshold
of
1,000
AUs
means
that
33


a
permit
would
be
required
if
after
construction
the
CAFO
would
34


have
an
AU
capacity
of
2,500
of
such
swine
(1,000

CAFOs
——
SURETY
BONDS.
The
bill
addresses
two
documents
2


filed
by
the
owner
of
a
CAFO
with
DNR
when
it
administers
water
3


quality
regulations:
(1)
an
application
for
a
construction
4


permit
(permit)
issued
by
DNR
that
authorizes
the
construction,
5


including
expansion,
of
a
structure
and
a
manure
management
6


plan
(MMP)
governing
the
storage
and
application
of
manure
7


originating
from
the
operation.
8


The
bill
provides
that
DNR
cannot
approve
an
MMP
unless
the
9


owner
furnishes
a
surety
bond
for
$10
million
for
the
purpose
10


of
paying
costs
resulting
from
the
discharge
of
manure
from
11


the
owner’s
operation.
Moneys
payable
under
the
bond
must
12


be
used
in
cases
in
which
the
discharge
has
caused
property
13


damage.
The
moneys
must
be
used
to:
(1)
reimburse
the
state
or
14


a
political
subdivision,
or
an
agent
of
the
state
or
political
15


subdivision,
for
costs
associated
with
containment
or
cleanup;
16


(2)
the
restoration
of
wild
animal
populations
or
habitat;
and
17


(3)
the
payment
of
a
judgment
award
recovered
by
a
plaintiff
18


in
a
civil
action.
The
bill
provides
for
the
expiration
or
19


cancellation
of
the
bond.
DNR
is
authorized
to
suspend
or
20


revoke
an
MMP
if
a
replacement
bond
is
not
filed.
The
bill
21


also
provides
that
DNR
is
prohibited
from
issuing
a
permit
to
22


the
owner
authorizing
the
construction
of
any
structure
if
a
23


bond
covering
an
operation
has
expired,
been
canceled,
been
24


suspended,
or
been
revoked.
25


CAFOs
——
PERMITS.
The
bill
requires
a
board
to
send
a
26


notice
to
certain
landowners
that
a
permit
application
has
been
27


filed
with
DNR
proposing
to
construct
a
structure
which
is
28


part
of
a
proposed
or
existing
CAFO.
The
notice
must
be
sent
29


by
certified
or
ordinary
mail
to
each
neighbor
holding
legal
30


title
to
land
located
within
two
miles
from
the
location
of
31


the
proposed
construction
site.
An
application
must
include
32


a
brief
summary
of
information
regarding
the
proposal,
which
33


must
at
least
state:
(1)
the
identity
of
the
applicant,
(2)
34


the
type
and
numbers
of
animals
to
be
confined
at
the
CAFO

and
(3)
the

proposed
to
be
constructed.
2


The
notice
must
include
the
summary
and
may
also
state
time
and
3


place
of
a
public
hearing
regarding
the
application
conducted
4


by
the
board.
The
bill
provides
that
the
same
information
must
5


be
included
in
the
notice
of
a
public
hearing.
6


CAFOs
——
MASTER
MATRIX.
The
bill
eliminates
provisions
7


that
require
the
use
of
a
master
matrix
as
part
of
the
process
8


to
approve
or
disapprove
a
permit
for
the
construction
or
9


expansion
of
a
structure
associated
with
a
CAFO.
The
master
10


matrix
is
a
formula
designed
to
produce
a
statistically
11


verifiable
basis
for
determining
whether
to
approve
or
12


disapprove
an
application
for
the
construction
of
a
structure.
13


The
master
matrix
measures
impacts
to
air,
water,
and
the
14


community
(567
IAC
ch.
65,
Appendix
C).
15


CAFOs
——
STRUCTURAL
FAILURES.
The
bill
requires
the
owner
16


or
operator
of
a
CAFO
to
notify
DNR
of
any
actual
or
probable
17


immediate
structural
failure
from
an
associated
structure.
The
18


failure
may
be
the
result
of
either
the
design
or
construction
19


of
the
structure.
The
determination
of
a
probable
immediate
20


structural
failure
must
be
based
on
factors
established
by
DNR
21


which
may
include
an
observation
by
the
owner
or
operator
or
22


a
report
submitted
to
the
owner
or
operator
by
a
professional
23


engineer.
DNR
is
required
to
adopt
rules
that
provide
for
24


notice
procedures
which
may
take
into
account
factors
that
25


quantify
the
level
of
threat
to
water
quality
resulting
from
a
26


discharge
or
an
injury
to
or
death
of
an
animal
maintained
in
27


an
associated
confinement
building.
28


OPEN
FEEDLOT
OPERATIONS
——
DEFINITION.
The
bill
revises
the
29


definition
of
an
open
feedlot
operation
(feedlot)
to
include
30


any
place
whether
partially
roofed
or

2


that
includes
a

body
or

segment
that
has
been
3


placed
on
a

waters.
The
prohibition
would
4


no
longer
apply
once
the
water
was
removed
from
the
list
and
5


DNR
determined
that
the
water
meets
the
state
surface
water
6


classification
for
primary
contact
recreational
use.
7


DNR’s
list
of
impaired
waters
is
approved
by
EPA
according
8


to
federal
and
state
requirements
(33
U.S.C.
§1313
and
Code
9


sections
455B.194
and
455B.195).
DNR
is
also
required
to
10


develop
a
plan
for
restoring
the
impaired
waters,
including
by
11


identifying
its
total
maximum
daily
loads;
commonly
referred
to
12


as
TMDL
that
calculates
the
amount
of
contaminants
that
a
water
13


body
may
receive
and
still
meet
federal
water
quality
standards
14


(40
C.F.R.
§130.7(b)(4)).
Based
on
these
measurements,
the
15


department
classifies
surface
waters
for
a
number
of
designated
16


uses
including
primary
contact
recreational
use
which
means
17


that
the
water
is
considered
safe
for
uses
that
may
result
in
a
18


person’s
prolonged
and
direct
contact
with
the
water,
including
19


by
ingestion
while
swimming
(33
U.S.C.

and
567
IAC
20


61.3).
21


CAFOs

23


associated
with
a
CAFO
or
feedlot
within
a

department.
27


CAFOs
AND
FEEDLOTS
——
SINKHOLES.
The
bill
prohibits
the
28


construction
of
a
structure
associated
with
a
CAFO
or
feedlot
29


if
DNR
has
classified
the
area
of

the
30


formation
of
sinkholes.
In
that
case,
the
owner

31


of

must
file
a

with
DNR.
The

The
bill
prohibits
the
stockpiling
of
7


certain
dry
or
solid
manure
on
such
terrain.
The
bill
also
8


regulates
the
use
of
structures
or

existing
on
9


such
terrain
prior
to
the

the
terrain
be
kept
14


in
a
qualified
stockpile
structure
which
is
a
building
or
other

It
provides
for
the
removal
of

It
also
requires
that
an
existing
17


stockpile
be
discontinued
on
July

waiver.
19


Stockpiling
refers
to
that
part
of
manure
or
effluent
20


produced
by
agricultural
animals
which
is
“dry”
or
“solid”,
21


meaning
