Declaration

The
general

finds
that
the
release
of
regulated

substances
from

storage
tanks
constitutes
a
16


threat
to
the
public
health
and
safety
and
to
the
natural
17


resources
of
the
state,
and
that
existing
regulatory
programs
18


of
the
department
and
other
agencies
do
not
adequately
or
19


appropriately
address
this
substantial
public
concern.
20


Additionally,
the
general
assembly
recognizes
that
because
the


21

of

Iowa
comprehensive
petroleum
22

storage
tank

created

interest
24


to
expeditiously
use
any
remaining

from

to
assist

The
