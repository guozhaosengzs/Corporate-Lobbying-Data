EXPLANATION

the
explanation’s

Under

seeks
a
temporary
restricted
22


license
following
an
operating-while-intoxicated
(OWI)
23


offense,
the
person
is
required
to
install
an
approved
ignition
24


interlock
device
on
all
motor
vehicles
owned
or
operated
by
25


the
person.
This
bill
requires
a
person
seeking
a
temporary
26


restricted

offense
to
install
an
27


approved
ignition
interlock
device
only
on
all
motor
vehicles
28


operated
by
the
person.
The
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
29


to
Code
chapters
321J
(operating
while
intoxicated)
and
901D
30


(sobriety
