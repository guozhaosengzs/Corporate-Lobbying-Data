release
of
a
person
on
their
personal
recognizance,
or
upon

is
released,
the
person
shall
be
supervised
by
an
electronic
1


tracking
and
monitoring
system
if
the
person
has
been
assessed
2


as
a
high
risk
to
reoffend
in
addition
to
any
other
conditions

specified
under

section

4


The
bill
amends
Code
section
811.2
relating
to
conditions
5


of
release
of
a
person
after
arrest.
In
determining
the
6


conditions
of
release,
the
bill
requires
the
court
to
take
into
7


account
the
results
of
a
domestic
abuse
lethality
screening
8


assessment,
if
available.
9


The
bill
requires
a
person
who
is
serving
a
domestic
10


abuse
assault
class
“D”
felony
sentence
under
Code
section
11


708.2A(4)
or
(5),
to
be
supervised
by
an
electronic
tracking
12


and

system,
upon
release,
when
the
person
is
not
13


confined
in
a
secure
area
of
a
community-based
correctional
14


facility
until
such
time
as
the
district
department
determines
15


the
person
may
be
supervised
without
the
electronic
tracking
16


and
monitoring
system.
17


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
18


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
19


25B.2(3),
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
20


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
21


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
22


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
23


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
