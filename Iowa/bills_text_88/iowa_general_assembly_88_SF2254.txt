the
department
of
natural
resources
is
prohibited
from
2


approving

The
bill
does

construction
if,
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
bill,
the
5

6


LEGISLATIVE
STUDY.
The
bill
requests
that
the
legislative
7


council
establish
an
interim
committee
to
study
methods
to
8


increase
greater
public
participation
in
the
construction
of
9


structures
and
submit
a
report
to
the
general
assembly
by
10


January
10,
2021.
11


BACKGROUND.
The
department
of
natural
resources
regulates
12


confinement
feeding
operations.
A
confinement
feeding
13


operation
refers
to
an
area
in
which
certain
animals
associated
14


with
agriculture
are
confined
and
fed
and
maintained
under
a
15


roof
for
45
days
or
more
in
any
12-month
period,
and
includes
16


associated
structures
including
buildings
and
facilities
used
17


to
store
manure.
A
permit
to
construct
or
expand
a
structure
18


is
required
if
the
structure
is
an
unformed
manure
storage
19


structure
(e.g.,
an
anaerobic
lagoon
or
earthen
manure
storage
20


structure)
or
the
structure
is
associated
with
a
confinement
21


feeding
operation
of
a
certain
size
based
on
a
calculation
22


of
its
proposed
animal
unit
capacity
(AUC)
which
equals
the
23


maximum
number
of
animal
units
that
may
be
maintained
under
24


roof
at
any
one
time
(Code
section
459.102).
A
permit
is
25


required
if
the
confinement
feeding
operation
would
have
an
26


AUC
of
1,000
or
more.
In
calculating
AUC,
each
of
various
27


types
of
animals
are
assigned
a
special
equivalency
factor.
28


For
example,
a
butcher
or
breeding
swine
weighing
more
than
29


55
pounds
has
an
equivalency
factor
of
0.4
animal
units
(Code
30


section
459.102).
A
confinement
feeding
operation
proposed
to
31


include
one
or
more
buildings
with
a
capacity
of
2,500
breeding
32


swine
would
be
required
to
obtain
a
permit
(2,500
x
0.4
=
1,000
33


AUC).
34


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
