11


or

(2)
Once

20


in

the
burden

on
the


21


employee
to
overcome
the
presumption
by
establishing
that
the
22


employee
was
not
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
or


23


that
intoxication
was
not
a
substantial

EXPLANATION
26


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
27


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the

assembly.
28


Under
current
law,
workers’
compensation
is
not
allowed
for
29


injury
caused
by
an
employee’s
intoxication,
which
did
not
30


arise
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment
but
which
was
31


due
to
the
effects
of
alcohol
or
certain
substances,
if
the
32


intoxication
was
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
the
injury.
33


If
the
employer
shows
that,
at
the
time
of
the
injury
or
34


immediately
following
the
injury,
the
employee
had
positive

test
results
reflecting
the
presence
of
alcohol,
or
certain
1


other
substances,
it
is
presumed
under
current
law
that
2


the
employee
was
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
injury
and
3


that
intoxication
was
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
the
4


injury.
The
employee
then
has
the
burden
to
disprove
either
5


presumption.
This
bill
strikes
both
presumptions.
