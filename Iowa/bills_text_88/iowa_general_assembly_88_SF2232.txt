NEW
SECTION


.
633A.4215
Distributions
in
further



trust.



1.
As
used
in
this
section:



a.
“First
trust”
means
a
trust
from
which
income
or



principal
is
transferred
into
the
second
trust.



b.
“Restricted
trustee”
means
a
trustee
of
the
first
trust



if
such
trustee
is
a
beneficiary
of
the
first
trust
or
if
such



trustee
has
the
power
to
change
the
trustees
of
the
first
trust



within
the
meaning
of
subsection
5.



c.
“Second
trust”
means
a
trust
into
which
the
income
or



principal
of
the
first
trust
has
been
transferred.



2.
Unless
the
terms
of
the
governing
instrument
expressly



provide
otherwise,
if
a
trustee
of
the
first
trust
has



discretion
under
the
terms
of
a
governing
instrument
to
make
a



distribution
of
income
or
principal
to
or
for
the
benefit
of



one
or
more
beneficiaries
of
the
first
trust,
whether
or
not

restricted
by
any
standard,
then
the
trustee,
independently
or



with
court
approval,
may
appoint
part
or
all
of
the
income
or



principal
subject
to
the
trustee’s
discretion
in
favor
of
a



trustee
of
a
second
trust
under
a
governing
instrument
separate



from
the
governing
instrument
of
the
first
trust.
Before



exercising
the
trustee’s
discretion
to
appoint
and
distribute



assets
to
a
second
trust,
the
trustee
of
the
first
trust
shall



determine
whether
the
appointment
is
necessary
or
desirable



after
taking
into
account
the
purposes
of
the
first
trust,
the



terms
and
conditions
of
the
second
trust,
and
the
consequences



of
the
distribution.
In
addition,
the
following
apply
to
all



appointments
made
under
this
section:



a.
The
second
trust
may
only
have
as
beneficiaries
one
or



more
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
first
trust
to
or
for
whom



a
discretionary
distribution
of
income
or
principal
may
be



made
from
the
first
trust,
or
to
or
for
whom
a
distribution
of



income
or
principal
may
be
made
in
the
future
from
the
first



trust
at
a
time
or
upon
the
happening
of
an
event
specified



under
the
first
trust.



b.
No
restricted
trustee
of
the
first
trust
may
exercise



such
authority
over
the
first
trust
to
the
extent
that
doing
so



could
have
any
of
the
following
effects:



(1)
Benefiting
the
restricted
trustee
as
a
beneficiary



of
the
first
trust,
unless
the
exercise
of
such
authority
is



limited
by
an
ascertainable
standard
based
on
or
related
to



health,
education,
maintenance,
or
support.



(2)
Removing
restrictions
on
discretionary
distributions
to



a
beneficiary
imposed
by
the
governing
instrument
under
which



the
first
trust
was
created,
except
that
a
provision
in
the



second
trust
which
limits
distributions
by
an
ascertainable



standard
based
on
or
related
to
the
health,
education,



maintenance,
or
support
of
any
such
beneficiary
is
permitted,



as
is
a
distribution
to
a
trust
established
pursuant
to
42



U.S.C.
§1396p(d)(4).



c.
No
restricted
trustee
of
the
first
trust
may
exercise



such
authority
over
the
first
trust
to
the
extent
that
doing



so
would
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
distributions
that



can
be
made
from
the
second
trust
to
the
restricted
trustees
of



the
first
trust
or
to
a
beneficiary
who
may
change
the
trustees

of
the
first
trust
within
the
meaning
of
subsection
5
compared



to
the
distributions
that
can
be
made
to
such
trustee
or



beneficiary,
as
the
case
may
be,
under
the
first
trust,
unless



the
exercise
of
such
authority
is
limited
by
an
ascertainable



standard
based
on
or
related
to
health,
education,
support,



or
maintenance
within
the
meaning
of
section
2041(b)(1)(A)
or



2514(c)(1)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.



d.
The
provisions
of
paragraphs
“b”
and
“c”
only
apply
to



restrict
the
authority
of
a
trustee
if
either
a
trustee,
or



a
beneficiary
who
may
change
the
trustee,
is
a
United
States



citizen
or
domiciliary
under
the
Internal
Revenue
Code,
or
the



trust
owns
property
that
would
be
subject
to
United
States



estate
or
gift
taxes
if
owned
directly
by
such
a
person.



e.
In
the
case
of
any
trust
contributions
which
have
been



treated
as
gifts
qualifying
for
the
exclusion
from
gift
tax



described
in
section
2503(b)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code,
by



reason
of
the
application
of
section
2503(c)
of
the
Internal



Revenue
Code,
the
governing
instrument
for
the
second
trust



shall
provide
that
the
beneficiary’s
remainder
interest
shall



vest
no
later
than
the
date
upon
which
such
interest
would
have



vested
under
the
terms
of
the
governing
instrument
for
the



first
trust.



f.
The
exercise
of
such
authority
may
not
reduce
any
income



interest
of
any
income
beneficiary
of
any
of
the
following



trusts:



(1)
A
trust
for
which
a
marital
deduction
has
been
taken
for



federal
tax
purposes
under
section
2056
or
2523
of
the
Internal



Revenue
Code,
or
for
state
tax
purposes
under
any
comparable



provision
of
applicable
state
law.



(2)
A
charitable
remainder
trust
under
section
664
of
the



Internal
Revenue
Code.



(3)
A
grantor
retained
annuity
or
unitrust
trust
under



section
2702
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.



g.
The
exercise
of
such
authority
does
not
apply
to
trust



property
subject
to
a
presently
exercisable
power
of
withdrawal



held
by
a
trust
beneficiary
to
whom,
or
for
the
benefit
of



whom,
the
trustee
has
authority
to
make
distributions,
unless



after
the
exercise
of
such
authority,
the
beneficiary’s
power



of
withdrawal
is
unchanged
with
respect
to
the
trust
property.




Senate
File

h.
The
exercise
of
such
authority
is
not
prohibited
by
a



provision
in
the
governing
instrument
that
prohibits
amendment



or
revocation
of
the
trust.



i.
Any
appointment
made
by
a
trustee
shall
be
considered



a
distribution
by
the
trustee
pursuant
to
the
trustee’s



distribution
powers
and
authority.



j.
Notwithstanding
the
foregoing
provisions
of
this



subsection,
the
governing
instrument
of
the
second
trust



may
grant
a
power
of
appointment
to
one
or
more
of
the



beneficiaries
of
the
second
trust
who
are
beneficiaries
of



the
first
trust.
The
power
of
appointment
may
include
the



power
to
appoint
trust
property
to
the
holder
of
the
power
of



appointment,
the
holder’s
creditors,
the
holder’s
estate,
the



creditors
of
the
holder’s
estate,
or
any
other
person,
whether



or
not
that
person
is
a
trust
beneficiary.



k.
A
permitted
exercise
of
the
trustee’s
discretion
over



the
entire
income
and
principal
of
the
first
trust
may
be
made



by
modifying
the
first
trust
without
an
actual
distribution



of
property,
in
which
case
the
second
trust
is
the
modified



first
trust.
A
modification
in
further
trust
pursuant
to
this



paragraph
shall
require
the
trustee
to
notify
all
beneficiaries



of
the
trust,
in
writing,
at
least
twenty
days
prior
to
the



effective
date
of
such
exercise,
but
shall
not
be
subject
to



the
limitations
of
part
2
of
subchapter
II
of
this
chapter.



l.
This
section
applies
to
any
trust
administered
under



the
laws
of
this
state,
including
a
trust
whose
governing



jurisdiction
is
transferred

action
that
may
not
be
taken
by
a
trustee
of
the



first
trust
by
reason
of
the
restrictions
in
subsection
2,



paragraph
“b”
,
may
instead
be
taken
by
any
other
trustee
of
the



first
trust
who
is
not
so
restricted,
or,
if
none,
by
the
next



available

who
is
not



so
restricted.

may
be
a

without
the



United

For
the
purposes
of
subsections
1
and
2,
a
beneficiary



shall
be
considered

defined
in
section
672
of
the



Internal
Revenue
Code,
to
the
beneficiary.



6.
The
exercise
of
the
power
to
distribute
the
income



or
principal
of
the
trust
under
this
section
shall
be
by
an



instrument
in
writing,
signed
and
acknowledged
by
the
trustee,



and
filed
with
the
records
of
the
trust.
The
trustee
of
the



first
trust
may
notify
the
beneficiaries
of
the
first
trust,
in



writing,
prior
to
the
effective
date

under
this
section.
A

7.
The
exercise
of
the
power
to
distribute
the
income
or



principal
of
the
trust
under
this
section
shall
be
considered



the
exercise

that
shall
not
be



exercised
in
favor
of
the
trustee,
the
trustee’s
creditors,
the



trustee’s
estate,
or
the
creditors
of
the

to
alienate
trust
