Declaration
of
policy.
14


The
general
assembly
finds
that
the
release
of
regulated
15


substances
from
underground
storage
tanks
constitutes
a
16


threat
to
the
public
health
and
safety
and
to
the
natural
17


resources
of
the
state,
and
that
existing
regulatory
programs
18


of
the
department
and
other
agencies
do
not
adequately
or
19


appropriately
address
this
substantial
public
concern.
20


Additionally,
the
general
assembly
recognizes
that
because
the


21


appropriation
of
moneys
to
the
Iowa
comprehensive
petroleum
22


underground
storage
tank
fund
created
in
section

Code

ended
on
December

it
is

public
interest
24


to
expeditiously
use
any
remaining
moneys
from
the
Iowa
25


comprehensive
petroleum
underground
storage
tank

to
assist
26


as
many

as
possible
with

all

for

from

through

The

program
shall
last


30


as
long
as
moneys
remain
available,
and
the

31


recognizes
that
