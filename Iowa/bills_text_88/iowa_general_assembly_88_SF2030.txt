I
revoke
the
TOD
deed
after
it
is
recorded?
5


There
are
three
ways
to
revoke
a
recorded
TOD
deed:
[1]
6


Complete
and
acknowledge
a
revocation
form,
and
record
it
in
7


each
county
where
the
property
is
located.
[2]
Complete
and
8


acknowledge
a
new
TOD
deed
that
disposes
of
the
same
property,
9


and
record
it
in
each
county
where
the
property
is
located.
10


[3]
Transfer
the
property
to
someone
else
during
your
lifetime
11


by
a
recorded
deed
that
expressly
revokes
the
TOD
deed.
You
12


may
not
revoke
the
TOD
deed
by
will.
13


I
am
being
pressured
to
complete
this
form.
What
should
I
14


do?
15


Do
not
complete
this
form
under
pressure.
Seek
help
from
a
16


trusted
family
member,
friend,
or
lawyer.
17


Do
I
need
to
tell
the
beneficiaries
about
the
TOD
deed?
18


No,
but
it
is
recommended.
Secrecy
can
cause
later
19


complications
and
might
make
it
easier
for
others
to
commit
20


fraud.

which
transfers
real
property
outside
of
probate
26


to
one
or
more

effective
at
the

27


death.
28


To
be
valid,
a
transfer
on

must
contain
the


29


essential
elements
and
formalities
of
a
properly
recordable
30

S.F.

states
that
the
deed
is
irrevocable.
A
transferor
may
revoke
1


a
transfer
on
death
deed
by
acknowledging
and
recording
an
2


inconsistent
transfer
on
death
deed,
or
an
instrument
of
3


revocation
or
inter
vivos
deed
that
expressly
revokes
the
deed.
4


A
transfer
on
death
dead
is
nontestamentary,
and
the
5


capacity
required
to
make
or
revoke
a
transfer
on
death
deed
is
6


the
same
capacity
required
to
make
a
will.
7


A
transfer
on
death
deed
is
effective
even
if
the
beneficiary
8


does
not
receive
notice
or
delivery
of
the
deed
during
the
9


transferor’s
lifetime,
and
even
if
the
transferor
does
not
10


receive
consideration
for
the
deed.
11


During
the
transferor’s
lifetime,
a
transfer
on
death
deed
12


does
not
affect
the
transferor’s
interest
in
the
property,
13


including
the
right
to
transfer
or
encumber
the
property,
nor
14


does
the
transfer
on
death
deed
create
a
legal
or
equitable
15


interest
in
favor
of
the
designated
beneficiary
or
subject
the
16


property
to
claims
of
a
creditor
of
the
designated
beneficiary.
17


If
the
transferor
transfers
the
property
that
is
the
subject
18


of
a
transfer
of
death
deed
before
the
transferor’s
death,
the
19


transfer
on
death
deed
is
of
no
effect
at
the
death
of
the
20


transferor.
21


At
the
death
of
the
transferor,
subject
to
Code
sections
22


633.238
(elective
share
of
surviving
spouse),
633.523
(uniform
23


simultaneous
death
act),
and
633.535
(felonious
death),
the
24


property
is
transferred
to
the
designated
beneficiary
if
the
25


designated
beneficiary
is
alive.
If
the
designated
beneficiary
26


predeceases
the
transferor,
the
interest
of
the
designated
27


beneficiary
lapses.
28


Subject
to
Code
section
558.41
(recording),
a
beneficiary
29


who
takes
property
under
a
transfer
on
death
deed
takes
the
30


property
subject
to
all
conveyances,
encumbrances,
assignments,
31


contracts,
mortgages,
liens,
and
other
interests
to
which
the
32


property
is
subject
at
the
transferor’s
death.
33


If
the
transferor
owns
the
property
as
a
joint
tenant
or
as
34


a
tenant
by
the
entirety,
the
transfer
on
death
deed
is
only

effective
if
the
transferor
is
the
last
surviving
joint
tenant
1


or
tenant
by
the
entirety.
2


A
beneficiary
may
disclaim
all
or
part
of
the
beneficiary’s
3


interest
as
provided
by
Code
chapter
633E
(uniform
disclaimer
4


of
property
interest
Act).
5


To
the
extent
that
the
transferor’s
probate
estate
is
6


insufficient
to
satisfy
an
allowed
claim
against
the
estate
7


or
a
statutory
allowance
to
a
surviving
spouse
or
child,
the
8


estate
may
enforce
the
liability
against
property
transferred
9


at
the
transferor’s
death
by
a
transfer
on
death
deed.
10


The
bill
provides
an
optional
form
of
a
transfer
on
death
11


deed
and
an
optional
form
for
the
revocation
of
a
transfer
on
12


death
deed.
13


The
bill
does
not
affect
any
deed
executed
and
recorded
prior
14


to
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
and
applies
to
a
transfer
on
15


death
deed
made
before,
on,
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
16


bill
by
a
transferor
dying
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of

the
bill.
