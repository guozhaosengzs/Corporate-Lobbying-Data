Currently,

provides
grants
to

recovering
from
an
12


injury
received

duty
in
a
combat
zone
or
in
a
13


zone
where
the
veteran
was
receiving
hazardous
duty
pay
after
14


September
11,
2001.
This
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
15


the
veteran
be
injured
in
a
combat
zone
or
zone
where
the
16


veteran
is
receiving
hazardous
duty
pay
in
order
to
qualify
for
17


the
program,
but
requires
the
veteran
be
injured
in
the
line
of
18


duty
outside
the
United
States.

Under
Code
section
99G.39,
$2.5
million
in
lottery
revenues
20


are
transferred

fiscal
year

the
veterans
trust
fund.
21


The
bill
amends
Code
section
35A.13(4)(a)
and
provides
that
22


$600,000
of
the
moneys
received
by
the
veterans
trust
fund
23


pursuant
to
Code
section
99G.39
are
to
be
appropriated
to
the
24


commission
of
veterans
affairs.
The
bill
provides
that
the
25


commission
of
veterans
affairs
shall
transfer
$100,000
of
the
26


moneys
appropriated
to
the
commission
pursuant
to
Code
section
27


35A.13(4)(a)
to
the
injured
veterans
trust
fund
established
28


pursuant
to
Code
section
35A.14
each
fiscal
year.
However,
29


if
the
balance
of
the
injured
veterans
trust
fund
remaining
30


on
June
30
of
a
fiscal
year
is
$1
million
or
more,
no
moneys
31


are
transferred
in
a
succeeding
fiscal
year
until
the
balance
32


of
the
injured
veterans
trust
fund
remaining
on
June
30
of
a
33


fiscal
year
is
below
$700,000.
