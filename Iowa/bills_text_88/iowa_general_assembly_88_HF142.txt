by
establishing
a
moratorium
upon
5


the

(structures)
such
as
buildings
7


or
manure
storage
structures
associated
with
the
confinement
8


feeding
operation
where
swine
are
kept.
The
moratorium
does
9


not
apply
to
a

10


unit
capacity
of
300
or
fewer
animal
units.
11


The

of
the
moratorium,
12


the
department

18


LEGISLATIVE
STUDY.
The
bill
requests
that
the
legislative
19


council
establish
an
interim
committee
to
study
methods
to
20


increase
greater
public
participation
in
the
construction
of
21


structures
associated
with
swine
production
and
submit
a
report
22


to
the
general
assembly
by
January
10,
2020.
23


BACKGROUND.
The
department
of
natural
resources
regulates
24


confinement
feeding
operations.
A
confinement
feeding
25


operation
refers
to
an
area
in
which
certain
animals
associated
26


with
agriculture
are
confined
and
fed
and
maintained
under
a
27


roof
for
45
days
or
more
in
any
12-month
period,
and
includes
28


associated
structures
including
buildings
and
facilities
used
29


to
store
manure.
A
permit
to
construct
or
expand
a
structure
30


is
required
if
the
structure
is
an
unformed
manure
storage
31


structure
(e.g.,
an
anaerobic
lagoon
or
earthen
manure
storage
32


structure)
or
the
structure
is
associated
with
a
confinement
33


feeding
operation
of
a
certain
size
based
on
a
calculation
34


of
its
proposed
animal
unit
capacity
(AUC)
which
equals
the
35


-2-


LSB
1815YH
(2)
88


da/rn

H.F.
142


maximum
number
of
animal
units
that
may
be
maintained
under
1


roof
at
any
one
time
(Code
section
459.102).
A
permit
is
2


required
if
the
confinement
feeding
operation
would
have
an
3


AUC
of
1,000
or
more.
In
calculating
AUC,
each
of
various
4


types
of
animals
are
assigned
a
special
equivalency
factor.
5


For
example,
a
butcher
or
breeding
swine
weighing
more
than
6


55
pounds
has
an
equivalency
factor
of
0.4
animal
units
(Code
7


section
459.102).
A
confinement
feeding
operation
proposed
to
8


include
one
or
more
buildings
with
a
capacity
of
2,500
breeding
9


swine
would
be
required
to
obtain
a
permit
(2,500
x
0.4
=
1,000
10


AUC).
In
any
case,
a
proposed
confinement
feeding
operation
11


having
755
such
swine
would
be
subject
to
the
bill’s
moratorium
12


(755
x
0.4
=
302
AUC).
13


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill,
if
enacted,
would
take
effect
upon
14


that
date.
