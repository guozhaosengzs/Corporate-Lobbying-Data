traffic
safety
issues.
12


(4)
Other
solutions
or
safety
countermeasures
that
the
13


local

shall
verify
its
internal
32


calibrations
no
less
frequently
than
is
recommended
by
33


the
system’s
manufacturer.
If

In
addition
to
the

internal
calibration,
a
calibration
shall
be
conducted
by
a
2


person
trained
in
the
calibration
of
the
system
at

once
3


every
three
months,
which
calibration
may
be

i.
Prior
to

the
local
authority
10


shall
obtain
approval
from
the

A
local
authority
12


shall
submit
to
the
department
any
information
requested
by
13


the
department
during
the
approval
process.
If
the
local
14


authority’s
use
of
the
system
is
approved
by
the
department,
15


the
local
authority
shall
follow
the
requirements
set
forth
16


in
rules
adopted
by
the
department.
The
department
may
adopt

18


systems
to
the
extent
necessary
to
ensure
automated
traffic
19


law
enforcement
systems
are
operated
in
a

20


manner.
The
department
shall
have
the
authority
to
annually
21


review
all
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems
placed
on
22


primary

not
apply
24


to
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system
in
operation

A
local
authority
may
continue
to

operate
such
a
system
in
the

manner
as
the
system
was
27


operated
prior
to
January

2020.
However,
on
or
after
the
28


effective
date
of
this
Act,
when
a
local
authority
discontinues
29


operation
of
such
a
system,
any
new
manner
of
operation
or
new
30


system
operated
by
the
local
authority
on
a
primary
road
shall
31

created
by
the
local
2


authority
to
review
citations
issued
through
the
use
of
3


automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems.
If
a
person
appeals
4


in
this
manner,
the
decision
of
the
impartial
body
shall
serve
5


as
a
determination
of
liability
owed
to
the
local
authority
6


without
the
need
for
any
other
municipal
or
civil
infraction
7


proceedings.

(b)
An
appeal
to
the
district
court,
sitting
in
small

claims,
of
the
county
in
which
the
local
authority
is
located.
10


(2)
A
person
may
appeal
a
citation
as
provided
in
11


subparagraph
(1)
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
of
the
12


citation
being
issued

local
authority
by

ordinance.
If
a
person
does
not
appeal
the
citation
within
14


the
required
period
of
time,
the
citation
shall
serve
as
15


a
determination
of

prohibits
the
department
of

or
employing
the
use
of
any
system,
and

behalf,
from
operating
systems
without
approving
the
use
of
the
22


systems
following
an
established
self-certification
process.
23


The
self-certification
process
may
include
a
justification
24


report

A

of
systems
in
its
26


jurisdiction
and
must

authority,
or
another
28


entity
on

31


located
in
documented
high-crash
or
high-risk
locations
at
32


which
there
is
a

or
another
12


entity
on
a
local
authority’s
behalf,
from
operating
a
13


system
without
posting
required

For
a
fixed
system,
14


permanent
signs
advising
drivers
that
the
system
is
in
place
15


must
be
posted
in

on
a
local
authority’s
27


behalf,
from
issuing
a
citation
resulting
from
the
use
of
a
28


system
until
an
active
peace
officer
of
the
local
authority
29


has
reviewed
and
approved
the
recorded
images
produced
by
the
30


system

For

following
the

a

memorandum
must
be
issued
4


and
mailed
to
the
owner
of
a

identified
by
the

system
in
lieu
of
any

However,
this
provision
does
6


not
apply
to
a
local
authority
that
has
installed
and
operated
7


systems
before
January

8


SYSTEM
CALIBRATIONS.
The
bill
requires
a
system
working
9


in
conjunction
with
a
speed
measuring
device
or
official
10


traffic-control
signal
to
comply
with
the
generally
accepted
11


procedures
for
operating
the
system.
A
system
must
verify
its
12


internal
calibrations
no
less
frequently
than
is
recommended
13


by
the
system’s
manufacturer.
If
an
internal
calibration
is
14


not
valid,
the
bill
prohibits
a
system
from
operating
until
a
15


successful
calibration
is
subsequently
conducted.
16


The
bill
also
requires
a
calibration
to
be
conducted
by
a
17


person
trained
in
the
calibration
of
the
system
at
least
once
18


every
three
months,
and
for
a
mobile
system,
prior
to
the
use
19


of
the
mobile
system
after
any
change
in
location.
A
local
20


authority,
or
another
entity
on
a
local
authority’s
behalf,
21


must
maintain
an
annual
log
of
the
calibrations.
The
log
and
22


documentation
of
the
calibrations
is
admissible
in
any
court
23


proceeding
relating
to
an
official
traffic-control
signal
24


violation
or
a
speed
limit
violation.
25


RECORDS
AND
REPORTS.
The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
to
26


compile
and
maintain
records
relating
to
the
number
of
traffic
27


violations
and
number
of
traffic
accidents
for
all
locations


28


at
which
the
local
authority,
or
another
entity
on
a
local
29


authority’s
behalf,
operates
or
intends
to
operate
a
system.
30


Such
records
must
be
compiled
and
maintained
by
the
local
31


authority
for
one
year
prior
to
the
installation
of
the
system
32


and
for
each
year
the
system
is
in
operation.
The
requirement
33


to
compile
and
maintain
records
for
one
year
prior
to
the
34


installation
of
a
system
does

The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
with
a
system
operating

within
its
jurisdiction
to
submit
an
annual
report
to
the

SYSTEMS
ON
PRIMARY
ROADS.
Prior
to
a
local
authority
7


placing
a
system
on
a
primary
road,
the
local
authority
must
8


obtain
approval
from
the
DOT.
A
local
authority
must
submit
9


to
the
DOT
any
information
requested
by
the
DOT
during
the
10


approval
process.
If
the
local
authority’s
use
of
the
system
11


is
approved
by
the
DOT,
the
local
authority
must
follow
the
12


requirements
set
forth
in
rules
adopted
by
the
DOT.
The
bill
13


authorizes
the
DOT
to
annually
review
all
systems
placed
14


on
primary
roads
and
allows
the
DOT
to
require
removal
or
15


modification
of
such
systems.
These
provisions
do
not
apply
16


to
a
system
in
operation
prior
to
January
1,
2020.
A
local
17


authority
may
continue
to
operate
such
a
system
in
the
same
18


manner
as
the
system
was
operated
prior
to
January
1,
2020.
19


However,
when
a
local
authority
discontinues
operation
of
such
20


a
system,
any
new
manner
of
operation
or
new
system
operated
by
21


the
local
authority
on
a
primary
road
must
comply.
22


APPEALS.
The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
to
designate
a
23


process
by
which
a
person
may
appeal
a
citation
issued
through
24


the
use
of
a
system,
which
at
a
minimum
must
provide
for
either
25


an
appeal
to
an
impartial
body
created
by
the
local
authority
26


or
an
appeal
to
the
district
court,
sitting
in
small
claims,
of
27


the
county
in
which
the
local
authority
is
located.
28


VIOLATIONS
BY
LOCAL
AUTHORITY.
The
bill
authorizes
the
DOT
29


to
enforce
the
bill
and
requires
the
DOT
to
notify
a
local
30


authority
of
any
alleged
violation
of
the
bill,
which
alleged
31


violation
is
subject
to
contested
case
proceedings
pursuant
32


to
Code
chapter
17A.
A
local
authority
found
to
have
been
33


operating
a
system
in
violation
of
the
bill
shall
be
precluded
34
