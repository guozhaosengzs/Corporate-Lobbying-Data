EXPLANATION
3


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
4


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
5


This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
468
by
providing
for
repairs
6


made
and
improvements
constructed
to
a
drainage
or
levee
7


district
(district)
as
ordered
by
a
board
managing
the
district
8


(board).
The
bill
provides
that
before
ordering
a
report
from
9


a
civil
or
drainage
engineer
or
soil
and
water
conservation
10


district
conservationist
regarding
a
proposed
repair
or
11


ordering
a
report
from
an
engineer
regarding
a
proposed
12


improvement,
the
board
must
make
a
determination
regarding
13


its
estimated
cost.
The
board
is
required
to
order
a
report,
14


is
provided
discretion
to
order
a
report,
or
is
prohibited
15


from
ordering
a
report,
based
on
that
estimate.
The
board’s
16


estimate
is
also
used
to
determine
whether
to
conduct
a
hearing
17


of
landowners
regarding
the
matter.
18


BACKGROUND.
Generally,
there
are
two
types
of
projects
19


authorized
under
Code
chapter
468,
a
repair
which
refers
to
20


restoring
a
facility
to
its
original
design
or
efficiency
21


and
an
improvement
which
enhances
or
enlarges
the
district’s
22


facility.
A
board
determines
whether
to
conduct
a
hearing
23


of
landowners
regarding
a
repair
or
improvement
based
on
the
24


project’s
estimated
cost
as
provided
in
the
report.
A
hearing
25


is
required
if
the
estimated
cost
of
the
repair
or
improvement
26


exceeds
$50,000.
In
that
case,
the
report
is
presented
at
27


the
hearing.
There
are
several
types
of
boards
that
may
have
28


jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
order
a
repair
or
29


improvement,
including
a
board
of
supervisors,
a
joint
board
of
30


supervisors,
or
an
elected
board
of
trustees.
