EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


This
bill
amends
Iowa’s
inheritance
tax
law
in
which
5


property
owned
by
a
person
who
has
died
(any
part
of
the
6


decedent’s
estate)
and
passing
to
an
heir
or
beneficiary,
7


regardless
of
whether
the
decedent
made
a
will,
is
taxed
8


at
a
progressively
higher
rate
based
on
the
value
of
the
9


property.
Several
exemptions
from
the
Iowa
inheritance
law
10


apply,
including
property
passing
to
a
surviving
spouse
or
11


certain
other
family
members
(e.g.,
children
or
grandchildren).
12


The
bill
creates
a
similar
exemption
for
agricultural
land,
13


including
any
associated
farmstead,
which
passes
to
a
farm
14


hand
subject
to
several
eligibility
requirements
for
each
of
15


the
previous
10
years.
The
agricultural
land
must
have
been
16


eligible
for
the
family
farm
tax
credit,
the
decedent
must
17


have
filed
a
schedule
F
as
part
of
a
federal
tax
return,
the
18


agricultural
land
must
have
been
part
of
an
ongoing
farming
19


operation,
and
the
farm
hand
must
have
received
a
wage
or
20


salary
for
performing
agricultural
labor
on
the
agricultural
21


land.
22


The
bill
applies
to
estates
of
decedents
dying
on
or
after
23


July
1,
2019.
