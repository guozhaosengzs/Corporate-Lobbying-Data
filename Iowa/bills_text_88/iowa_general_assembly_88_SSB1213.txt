EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


Currently,
most
government
entities
must
use
a
competitive
10


bidding
process
for
a
construction
project
when
that
project
11


is
estimated
to
cost
at
least
as
much
as
a
threshold
defined
12


in
Code
section
26.3.
This
bill
allows
a
government
entity
to
13


use
an
alternative
project
delivery
contract
in
circumstances
14


that
normally
require
the
government
entity
to
use
competitive
15


bidding
procedures.
The
bill
defines
a
government
entity
to
16


include
the
state
board
of
regents.
17


The
bill
creates
two
types
of
alternative
project
delivery
18


contracts,
each
with
specified
requirements.
The
first
19


alternative
is
the
construction
manager-at-risk
contract.
If
a
20


government
entity
opts
to
use
a
construction
manager-at-risk
21


contract,
the
government
entity
shall
select
an
engineer
22


or
architect
to
prepare
the
construction
documents
for
23


the
project.
That
engineer
or
architect
cannot
serve
as
24


the
construction
manager-at-risk.
The
government
entity
25


shall
use
a
two-phase
process
in
selecting
the
construction
26


manager-at-risk.
The
first
phase
shall
include
a
request
for
27


qualifications
and
the
government
entity’s
selection
criteria.
28


The
government
entity
may
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
29


than
five
of
the
construction
managers-at-risk
who
submitted
30


qualifications
to
participate
in
the
second
phase,
based
solely
31


on
the
qualifications
of
those
construction
managers-at-risk.
32


In
phase
two,
the
construction
managers-at-risk
that
the
33


government
entity
selects
will
provide
additional
information,
34


including
the
project
proposal,
costs,
and
fees.

government
entity
shall
rank
the
construction
managers-at-risk
1


in
a
manner
in
which
qualifications
account
for
at
least
40
2


percent
of
the
evaluation
and
cost
accounts
for
no
more
than
60
3


percent
of
the
evaluation.
The
government
entity
shall
select
4


the
construction
manager-at-risk
that
offers
the
best
value
5


based
on
the
evaluation
criteria.
If
the
two
parties
do
not
6


reach
an
agreement,
the
government
entity
shall
proceed
with
7


the
next
highest-ranked
construction
manager-at-risk
and
follow
8


this
process
until
the
government
entity
reaches
a
contract
9


with
a
construction
manager-at-risk.
The
selected
construction
10


manager-at-risk
shall
advertise
for
and
receive
sealed
bids
11


for
proposals
from
trade
contractors
or
subcontractors
and
12


publicly
review
those
bids
with
the
government
entity
in
a
13


manner
that
does
not
disclose
the
contents
of
the
bid
or
14


proposal
during
the
selection
process
to
a
person
not
employed
15


by
the
construction
manager-at-risk,
engineer,
architect,
or
16


government
entity
involved
with
the
project.
The
construction
17


manager-at-risk
will
select
a
bid
in
consultation
with
the
18


government
entity.
19


The
second
type
of
alternative
project
delivery
method
is
20


the
design-build
contract,
which
can
select
design-builders
in
21


either
a
three-phase
or
two-phase
process.
In
the
three-phase
22


process,
the
government
entity
shall
first
request
statements
23


of
qualifications
from
design-builders.
The
government
24


entity
shall
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
than
five
25


qualified
design-builders
to
move
on
to
phases
two
and
three.
26


In
the
second
phase,
the
government
entity
shall
solicit
27


technical
proposals
and
conceptual
designs
from
the
remaining
28


design-builders.
The
government
entity
shall
pay
a
stipend
29


to
any
design-builder
that
participates
in
phase
two
but
30


whose
contract
the
entity
does
not
select.
The
third
phase
31


involves
the
design-builders
submitting
construction
costs.
32


The
government
entity
shall
award
points
for
each
proposal.
If
33


the
government
entity
chooses
to
award
a
contract,
it
shall
34


award
the
contract
to
the
design-builder
