The

476.96,
which
included
definitions
for
14


“competitive
local

service
provider”
and
“local
15


exchange
carrier”,
and
provides
new
definitions
for
such
terms
16


in
those
Code
sections.
“Competitive
local
exchange
service
17


provider”
is
defined
as
any
person,
including
a
municipal
18


utility,
that
provides
local
exchange
services,
other
than
19


a
local
exchange
carrier
or
a
non-rate-regulated
wireline
20


provider
of
local
exchange
services.
“Local
exchange
carrier”

is
defined
as
any
person
that
was
the
incumbent
and
historical
22


rate-regulated
wireline
provider
of
local
exchange
services
23


or
any
successor
to
such

The
bill
provides
the
Iowa
utilities
board
with
authority
26


to
employ
or
appoint
an
independent
administrative
law
judge
27


to
preside
over
any
hearing

the
board.
28


Certain
provisions
applicable
to
the
employment
or
appointment
29


of
administrative
law
judges
by
state
agencies
do
not
apply
to
30


appointments
by
the
board.
31


Current
law
requires
the
board
to
deduct
all
amounts
charged
32


directly
to
any
person
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the

board

persons
providing
service

over
which
the
board
has
jurisdiction
in
proportion
to
their
2


respective
gross

The
bill
allows
the
board

to
charge
such
assessments
based
on
estimated
amounts,
and
to

be
assessed
to
some
or
all
persons
providing
service
over
which

the
board
has
jurisdiction.

Current
law
requires
telecommunications
carriers
subject
to
7


assessments
under
Code
chapter
477C
to
remit
the
assessments
8


to
a
special
fund
quarterly.
The
bill
removes
the
requirement
9


that
assessments
under
Code
chapter
477C
be
remitted
quarterly
10


and
instead
allows
the
board
to
direct
the
intervals
of
when
11


such
assessments
are
to
be
remitted.
12


Current
law
allows
the
board
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
of
up
13


to
$100,000
for
each
violation
of
Code
chapter
479,
relating
14


to
pipelines
and
underground
gas
storage,
or
any
rule
or
order
15


issued
pursuant
to
the
Code
chapter,
provided
that
the
maximum
16


penalty
does
not
exceed
$1
million
for
any
related
series
of
17


violations.
The
bill
removes
these
maximum
amounts
and
instead
18


provides
that
a
civil
penalty
levied
by
the
board
shall
be
in
19


accordance
with
specified
federal
law.
20


Current
law
requires
pipeline
companies
operating
pipelines
21


or
underground
storage
under
Code
chapter
479A
to
pay
the
board
22


an
annual
inspection
fee
of
50
cents
for
each
mile
of
pipeline
23


located
in
Iowa.
The
bill
removes
this
set
fee
and
instead
24


allows
the
board
to
charge
pipeline
companies
with
annual
25


inspection
fees
that
are
directly
attributable
to
the
costs
of
26


conducting
