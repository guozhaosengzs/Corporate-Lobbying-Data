20.15
Elections.
3


1.
Upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
certification
of
an
4


employee
organization,
the
board
shall
submit
a
question
to
5


the
public
employees
at
an
election
in
the
bargaining
unit
6


found
appropriate
by
the
board.
The
question
on
the
ballot
7


shall
permit
the
public
employees
to
vote
for
no
bargaining
8


representation
or
for
any
employee
organization
which
has
9


petitioned
for
certification
or
which
has
presented
proof
10


satisfactory
to
the
board
of
support
of
ten
percent
or
more
of
11


the
public
employees
in
the
appropriate
unit.
12


2.
If
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
on
the
question
is
13


for
no
bargaining
representation,
the
public
employees
in
14


the
bargaining
unit
found
appropriate
by
the
board
shall
not
15


be
represented
by
an
employee
organization.
If
a
majority
16


of
the
votes
cast
on
the
question
is
for
a
listed
employee
17


organization,
then
that
employee
organization
shall
represent
18


the
public
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
found
appropriate
19


by
the
board.

If

of
the
public
employees
voting,
the
board
shall
22


conduct
a
runoff
election
among
the
two

receiving
the
23


greatest
number
of
votes.
24


4.

filed
by
any
party
to
the
25


election
within
ten
days
after
notice
of
the
results
of
26


the

if
the

finds
that
misconduct
or
other


27


circumstances
prevented
the
public
employees
eligible
to
28


vote
from
freely
expressing
their
preferences,
the
board
may
29


invalidate
the
election
and

of
the
election

providing

1


recertification

bill
requires
the
public
2


employment
relations
board
to
cancel
any
such
elections
3


scheduled
or
in
process.
The
bill
requires
the
board
4


to
consider
a
petition
for
certification
of
an
employee
5


organization
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
a
bargaining
6


unit
for
which
an
employee
organization
was
not
retained
and

recertified
as

8


unit
regardless
of

election,
notwithstanding
10


prior
requirements
prohibiting

12


The

13


decertification
election
is
determined
by
a
majority
vote

the

voting,
rather
than
the
15


total
membership
of

provides

a
runoff
election
if

certification
election
receives
a

18

required

organization
that
did
not

22


as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
a

23


to
be
listed
on
the
ballot
for
a
certification
election
from
30
24


percent
to
10
percent.
25


The
bill
strikes
language
prohibiting
the
board
from
26


considering
a
petition
for
certification
as
the
exclusive
27


bargaining
representative
of
a
bargaining
unit
unless
a
28


period
of
two
years
has
elapsed
from

date
of
the
last
29


certification
election
in
which
an

in

was
decertified
as
the
exclusive
33


representative
of
