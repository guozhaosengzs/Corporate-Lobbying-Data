EXPLANATION
14


The

not
constitute
agreement
with

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of

general

16


This
bill
creates
an
interstate
compact
to
allow
17


psychologists
from
other
states
to
practice
telepsychology
with
18


patients
living
in
Iowa,
to
practice
“face-to-face”
psychology
19


on
a
temporary
basis
in
Iowa,
and
to
allow
Iowa
psychologists
20


to
practice
telepsychology
with
patients
in
other
states.
The
21


compact
is
intended
to
authorize
regulatory
authorities
to
22


afford
legal
recognition,
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
terms
23


of
the
compact,
to
psychologists
licensed
in
another
state.
24


The
compact
does
not
apply
when
a
psychologist
is
licensed
25


in
both
the
“home”
and
“receiving”
states.
A
commission
is
26


created
to
oversee
the
compact,
which
is
effective
upon
the
27


enactment
into
law
by
the
seventh
compact
state.
