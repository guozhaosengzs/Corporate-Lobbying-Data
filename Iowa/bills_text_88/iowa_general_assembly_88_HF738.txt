The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with

the
explanation’s
substance
by

15


GENERAL.
Code
chapter
162
provides
for
the
regulation
of
16


commercial
establishments
that
hold
an
ownership
or
possessory
17


(custodial)
interest
in
certain
animals,
other
than
animals
18


used
for
an
agricultural
purpose
or
game
(Code
section
19


162.1),
as
regulated
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
20


stewardship
(DALS).
Commercial
establishments
include
a
number
21


of
types
of
operations
including
commercial
breeders,
dealers,
22


and
public
auctions
which
are
required
to
obtain
a
state
23


license
or,
alternatively,
a
permit
if
federally
licensed.
24


Commercial
establishments
also
include
a
pet
shop
which
must
25


obtain
a
state
license.
Finally,
a
commercial
establishment
26


classified
as
a
pound
operated
by
a
political
subdivision,
27


animal
shelter
operated
on
a
nonprofit
basis,
and
a
research
28


facility
must
obtain
a
certificate
of
registration.
A
state
29


license,
permit,
or
certificate
is
generally
referred
to
as
an
30


authorization.
A
commercial
breeder
includes
a
person
engaged
31


in
the
business
of
breeding
dogs
for
sale
and
a
dealer
includes
32


a
person
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
dogs
for
resale.
A
33


pet
shop
includes
a
person
purchasing
and
selling
dogs.
All
34


commercial
establishments
are
required
to
comply
with
standard
35

of
care
requirements
(Code
section
162.10A).
These
include
1


providing
adequate
feed,
adequate
housing
facilities
(primary
2


enclosures),
sanitary
control,
or
grooming
practices
(to
the
3


extent
that
the
lack
of
such
practices
causes
adverse
health
4


or
suffering).
It
also
includes
providing
the
dog
veterinary
5


care.
DALS
may
inspect
the
commercial
establishment
of
a
state
6


licensee
or
certificate
holder
by
entering
onto
its
business
7


premises
at
any
time
during
normal
working
hours
(Code
section
8


162.10B)
and
may
review
its
records.
Alternatively,
DALS
9


monitors
a
permittee
to
determine
whether
the
permittee
is
10


complying
with
required
standard
of
care
requirements.
All
11


entities
are
required
to
pay
authorization
fees
which
are
12


deposited
in
the
commercial
establishment
fund
(Code
section
13


162.2C)
which
is
reserved
for
use
by
DALS
to
administer
14


and
enforce
the
Code
chapter’s
provisions.
The
fee
for
a
15


certificate
of
registration
is
$75
and
the
fee
for
a
state
16


license
or
permit
is
$175.
17


COMMERCIAL
ESTABLISHMENTS.
The
bill
provides
for
a
number
18


of
commercial
establishments
required
to
obtain
a
state
license
19


and
therefore
are
subject
to
inspection
and
recordkeeping
20


requirements.
The
first
type
of
state
licensee
is
a
commercial
21


breeder
which
is
a
person
who
breeds
five
or
more
dogs
and
is
22


in
the
business
of
selling
a
specified
number
of
dogs
during
23


a
12-month
period.
A
commercial
breeder
must
obtain
a
state
24


license
(amended
Code
section
162.8).
A
breeder
other
than
a
25


commercial
breeder
is
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
The
26


second
type
of
state
licensee
is
a
commercial
dealer
who
is
27


engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
for
resale
five
or
more
dogs
28


or
cats
or
both
during
any
12-month
period.
A
commercial
29


dealer
must
obtain
a
state
license
(new
Code
section
162.7A).
30


A
dealer
who
is
not
a
commercial
dealer
must
still
obtain
31


either
a
state
license
or
permit
(amended
Code
section
169.7).
32


The
third
type
of
state
licensee
is
a
commercial
transporter
33


engaged
in
the
business
of
transferring
more
than
five
dogs
34


or
cats,
or
both,
from
a
commercial
breeder,
or
commercial

dealer,
or
another
commercial
transporter
at
any
time
during
1


a
12-month
period.
A
commercial
transporter
must
obtain
a
2


state
license
(new
Code
section
162.9).
A
transporter
other
3


than
a
commercial
transporter
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
4


Commercial
breeders,
commercial
dealers,
commercial
5


transporters
together
with
pet
shops
are
classified
as
6


qualified
commercial
establishments
(Code
section
162.2(22B)).
7


NEW
COMMERCIAL
ESTABLISHMENT
——
COMMERCIAL
RESCUE.
The
bill
8


also
creates
another
type
of
commercial
establishment
that
is
9


not
classified
as
qualified
subject
to
special
regulation.
A
10


commercial
rescue
is
not
associated
with
a
pound
or
animal
11


shelter,
acts
as
a
custodian
of
10
or
more
dogs
or
cats,
or
12


both,
at
any
time
during
a
12-month
period,
and
accepts
dogs
or
13


cats
from
five
or
more
persons,
not
counting
family
members,
or
14


who
has
taken
custody
of
five
or
more
dogs
or
cats
which
were
15


abandoned.
An
animal
rescue
must
obtain
a
state
license
(new
16


Code
section
162.8A).
17


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
STATE
LICENSE
APPLICATION.
The
bill
18


requires
a
commercial
breeder
to
include
in
a
state
license
19


application,
information
regarding
the
maximum
number
of
dogs
20


(both
adult
and
puppies)
expected
to
be
maintained
by
the
21


operation,
evidence
that
the
applicant
can
properly
care
for
22


the
dogs,
evidence
of
the
applicant’s
financial
responsibility
23


(e.g.,
surety
bond),
and
a
criminal
background
check.
DALS
24


is
required
to
disapprove
an
application
if
the
applicant
has
25


violated
statutes
or
rules
involving
animal
welfare.
26


FEES.
With
one
exception,
the
fees
for
the
new
types
of
27


commercial
establishments
are
the
same
as
for
state
licensees


28


or
permittees.
However,
for
commercial
breeders,
the
fee
29


equals
the
ordinary
fee
for
a
licensee
(base
fee)
plus
an
30


additional
amount
calculated
according
to
the
number
of
puppies
31


that
the
commercial
breeder
sold
during
the
previous
licensing
32


period.
The
base
amount
equals
$175,
and
the
scheduled
amount
33


ranges
from
$250
to
$750
(amended
Code
section
162.2B).

STATEMENTS.
A
commercial
breeder
must
provide
a
purchaser
of
1


that
dog
with
a
disclosure
statement
which
includes
information
2


regarding
the
commercial
breeder
and
the
health
of
the
dog
3


(e.g.,
a
veterinary
certificate
issued
by
a
veterinarian).
4


A
copy
of
the
disclosure
statement
must
accompany
any
5


future
transfer
of
the
dog
to
another
qualified
commercial
6


establishment
(commercial

and
any
future
sale
by
one
8


of
these
operations
to
a
retail
customer
(amended
Code
section
9


162.8).
A
qualified
commercial
establishment
must
maintain
a
10


record
of
disclosure
statements
for
three
years.
11


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
STANDARD
OF
CARE
REQUIREMENTS.
The
12


bill
requires
a
commercial
breeder
to
comply
with
additional
13


standard
of
care
requirements
which
provide
for
a
dog’s
daily
14


food
and
water
supply,
primary
enclosures,
and
veterinary
15


care
(new
Code
section
162.10).
A
number
of
these
special
16


requirements
govern
the
size
and
construction
of
the
primary
17


enclosure
which
become
effective
on
and
after
January
1,
18


2022.
The
new
standard
of
care
requirements
govern
dogs
19


maintained
in
both
indoor
and
outdoor
environments.
Other
20


requirements
govern
how
dogs,
including
dams,
are
confined,
and
21


opportunities
for
dogs
to
exercise
and
interact
with
other
dogs
22


and
humans.
DALS
may
adopt
rules
providing
additional
standard
23


of
care
requirements
based
on
a
number
of
factors,
including
24


accepted
management
practices
and
veterinary
medical
standards.
25


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
ELECTRONIC
DEVICES.
The
bill
26


requires
a
commercial
breeder
to
install
an
electronic
device
27


(microchip)
beneath
the
skin
of
a
dog
that
stores
information
28


regarding
the
dog,
including
its
health,
in
a
digital
format
29


(amended
Code
section
162.8).
30


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
INSPECTION
REQUIREMENTS.
The
bill
31


requires
DALS
to
inspect
the
business
premises
of
a
commercial
32


breeder
at
least
once
during
each
12-month
license
period.
33


UNIFORM
ENFORCEMENT.
The
bill
provides
that
DALS
is
to
34


adopt
rules
providing
criteria
for

enforcement
of
the

2


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
DISCIPLINARY
ACTION
BASED
ON
A
3


FAILURE
TO
PAY
TAXES.
In
taking
disciplinary
action
against
4


a
commercial
breeder,
DALS
may
suspend
or
revoke
the
person’s
5


state
license
for
failing
to
timely
remit
any
sales
or
use
6


tax
due
to
the
department
of
revenue
(amended
Code
section
7


162.10D).
8


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
CIVIL
PENALTIES.
DALS
currently
9


establishes,
imposes,
and
assesses
civil
penalties
for
10


violations
of
the
Code
chapter’s
provisions
(amended
Code
11


section
162.12A).
A
civil
penalty
applies
up
to
$500
per
day
12


for
a
violation.
For
a
housing
violation,
the
civil
penalty
13


is
assessed
for
the
first
day,
but
not
for
the
subsequent
15
14


days
to
allow
for
correction
according
to
a
departmental
plan.
15


Under
the
bill,
DALS
must
determine
if
a
corrective
plan
is
16


appropriate.
If
DALS
prepares
and
delivers
a
corrective
plan
17


to
the
commercial
establishment,
it
is
prohibited
from
engaging
18


in
its
ordinary
business
activities
until
DALS
verifies
19


that
all
corrections
have
been
made
after
an
inspection
of
20


the
business
premises
(amended
Code
section
162.12A).
If
a
21


commercial
establishment
fails
to
make
a
correction,
DALS
22


must
notify
the
county
sheriff
and
county
attorney
having
23


jurisdiction
over
the
matter
and
if
there
are
multiple
failures
24


to
correct,
DALS
must
also
report
the
matter
to
the
attorney
25


general.
26


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
——
CRIMINAL
PENALTIES.
Generally,
a
27


commercial
establishment
that
fails
to
meet
a
standard
of
care


28


is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
and
DALS
seizes
and
disposes
29


of
any
animals
which
have
been
mistreated.
The
bill
provides
30


that
a
commercial
breeder
who
fails
to
meet
a
standard
of


31


care
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
failure
causes
32


a
dog
to
suffer
serious
injury
or
death.
The
bill
provides
33


that
the
person
is
guilty
of
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
if
the
34


person
has
previously
been
convicted
of
causing
an
animal

In
addition,
DALS
is
authorized
to
1


confiscate,
impound,
and
dispose
of
all
animals
maintained
by
2


the
commercial
establishment.
DALS
may
petition
district
court
3


in
the
same
manner
as
a
county
attorney
may
in
cases
of
animal
4


abuse,
animal
neglect,
or
animal
torture
(Code
section
717B.4).
5


A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
6


more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
