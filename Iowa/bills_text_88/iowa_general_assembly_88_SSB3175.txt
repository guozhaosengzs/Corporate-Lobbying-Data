indebtedness
22


issued
as

EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


BACKGROUND.
Code
chapter
490,
the
“Iowa
Business
14


Corporation
Act”
(IBCA)
was
enacted
in
1989
(1989
Iowa
Acts,
15


chapter
288),
and
it
is
the
primary
Code
chapter
governing
the
16


requirements
for
the
creation,
organization,
and
operation
of
17


for-profit
corporations,
including
the
relationship
between
18


shareholders,
directors,
and
officers
of
the
corporation.
19


Generally,
and
with
notable
exceptions,
the
IBCA
establishes
20


default
requirements
and
procedures
which
may
be
modified
by
a
21


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws.
The
IBCA
is
22


administered
by
the
secretary
of
state.
23


BASIS
FOR
THE
IBCA.
The
IBCA
was
based
on
legislation
24


proposed
by
the
American
bar
association
(ABA)
referred
to
25


as
the
model
business
corporation
Act
(MBCA)
and
has
been
26


subsequently
amended.
The
most
substantial
amendments
to
27


the
IBCA,
based
on
ABA-recommended
legislation,
were
enacted
28


in
2013
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
31).
This
bill
includes
29


amendments
adopted
in
2016
by
the
ABA
corporate
laws
committee
30


and
published
as
the
fourth
edition
of
the
MBCA
(new
MBCA).
31


The
new
MBCA
is
divided
into
various
chapters
which
are
32


referred
to
as
subchapters
in
Code
chapter
490.
The
new
MBCA
33


makes
a
number
of
changes
to
most
of
its
sections,
in
many
34


instances
to
enhance
readability
or
internal
consistency.

FORMS
AND
FILING
FEES.
The
bill
revises
the
types
of
1


documents
that
the
secretary
of
state
may
prescribe
without
2


requiring
that
the
form
of
such
documents
are
mandatory
3


(amended
Code
section
490.121).
It
eliminates
specific
4


filing
fees
currently
set
forth
by
statute
which
presumably
5


would
leave
the
amount
of
such
fees
to
the
discretion
of
6


the
secretary
of
state
(amended
Code
section
490.122).
It
7


revises
requirements
to
determine
when
a
document
filed
with
8


the
secretary
of
state
becomes
effective
(amended
Code
section
9


490.123).
10


DEFINITIONS.
The
bill
rewrites
a
number
of
definitions
11


applicable
throughout
the
IBCA,
including
by
eliminating
the
12


definition
of
a
“public
corporation”
(a
corporation
having
a
13


class
of
voting
stock
that
is
listed
on
a
national
securities
14


exchange
or
held
of
record
by
more
than
2,000
shareholders)
15


which
currently
distinguishes
such
entities
from
closely
held
16


corporations
(amended
Code
section
490.140).
Therefore,
a
17


shareholder
agreement
would
survive
an
entity’s
move
from
18


a
closed
corporation
to
a
public
corporation
(amended
Code
19


section
490.732).
The
bill
defines
“eligible
entities”,
20


which
include
noncorporate
entities
authorized
to
engage
21


in
transactions
with
a
corporation,
including
by
merger
or
22


share
exchange
(amended
Code
sections
490.140,
490.1102,
and
23


490.1103).
24


FORUM.
The
bill
provides
that
the
article
of
incorporation
25


or
bylaws
may
specify
the
forum
for
litigation
involving
26


internal
corporate
claims
(new
Code
section
490.208).
27


RATIFICATION
AS
A
METHOD
TO
CURE
A
DEFECT
IN
A
CORPORATE


28


ACTION.
The
bill
provides
a
process
to
remedy
a
defect
29


in
the
manner
in
which
a
corporate
action
was
authorized
30


(“ratification”),
including
an
action
relating
to
the
issuance
31


of
shares,
thereby
creating
a
“safe
harbor”
procedure
for
a
32


corporation
to
avoid
a
legal
challenge.
The
remedial
action
33


may
be
taken
by
the
board
of
directors
and
if
required
by
34


the
shareholders.
It
also
provides
for
a
judicial
remedy.

Finally,
the
bill
provides
for
the
retroactive
validity
of
the
1


remedial
action
(new
Code
sections
490.145
through
490.152).
2


REGISTERED
OFFICES
AND
REGISTERED
AGENTS.
The
bill
provides
3


that
the
resignation
of
a
registered
agent
of
a
foreign
4


corporation
takes
effect
either
at
12:01
a.m.
on
the
31st
day
5


after
the
day
on
which
the
registration
statement
is
filed
with
6


the
secretary
of
state
or
the
designation
of
a
new
registered
7


agent
by
the
corporation,
whichever
is
earlier
(amended
Code
8


section
490.503).
9


DIRECTORS.
The
bill
provides
for
the
qualifications
of
10


directors
or
nominees
for
directors,
including
as
may
be
11


prescribed
by
the
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws
(e.g.,
12


not
being
subject
to
criminal,
civil,
or
administrative
13


sanctions).
It
requires
that
the
qualifications
must
be
both
14


reasonable
and
lawful
(amended
Code
section
490.802).
It
15


provides
for
the
judicial
removal
of
a
director
by
a
court
and
16


for
a
court
order
barring
the
director
from
seeking
reelection
17


(amended
Code
section
490.809).
It
also
provides
quorum
18


requirements
for
a
meeting
of
the
board
as
specified
by
the
19


articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws
so
long
as
it
consists
20


of
at
least
one-third
of
the
total
number
of
directors
as
21


currently
required
(amended
Code
section
490.824).
It
also
22


provides
that
in
a
noncompetitive
election,
a
director
who
23


failed
to
receive
a
majority
vote
may
fill
the
office
for
90
24


days
(new
Code
section
490.1022).
25


DIRECTORS
AND
OFFICERS
——
BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES
AND
26


EXPENSES.
A
director
or
officer
may
be
presented
with
27


a
business
opportunity
that
affects
the
interest
of
the
28


corporation,
and
may
create
a
duty
to
present
the
business
29


opportunity
to
the
corporation
to
be
approved
by
qualified
30


(i.e.,
disinterested)
board
members.
The
bill
provides
that
31


the
articles
of
incorporation
may
limit
or
eliminate
this
duty
32


(amended
Code
sections
490.202
and
490.870).
It
also
provides
33


for
advancing
expenses
to
directors
and
officers
(e.g.,
in

must
provide
a

affirmation

that

that

if
the

is
not

indemnified
(amended
Code
sections

and

OFFICERS
——
STANDARD
OF
CONDUCT.
The
bill
provides
methods
6


for
an
officer
to
report
a
violation
of
law
or
other
breach
of
a
7


fiduciary
obligation
(amended
Code
section
490.842).
8


SHAREHOLDERS.
The
bill
provides
for
procedures
for
9


notifying
shareholders
(amended
Code
section
490.141).
It
10


amends
provisions
allowing
for
remote
participation
by
11


shareholders,
by
providing
for
such
access
during
annual
12


and
special
meetings,
including
remote-only
access
without
13


a
designated
location
(amended
Code
section
490.709).
It
14


prohibits
a
corporation
from
voting
shares
of
an
entity
15


which
is
owned
or
controlled
by
the
corporation,
regardless
16


of
the
circumstances
(amended
Code
section
490.721).
It
17


provides
that
the
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws
cannot
18


establish
a
quorum
that
is
less
than
that
required
by
the
19


Code
chapter
(amended
Code
section
490.725).
It
requires
20


that
before
a
shareholder
(interest
holder)
becomes
liable
21


for
a
new
obligation
due
to
the
amendment
to
the
articles
of
22


incorporation
(new
interest
holder
liability),
the
shareholder
23


must
provide
written
consent
(amended
Code
section
490.1003).
24


SHARES
AND
DISTRIBUTIONS.
The
bill
provides
that
a
25


shareholder
may
become
personally
liable
for
the
debts
of
26


the
corporation
if
such
liability
is
due
to
a
shareholder’s
27


conduct.
It
eliminates
a
provision,
not
part
of
the
MBCA,
28


referred
to
as
the
“poison
pill”
that
allows
a
board
of
29


directors
to
prevent
a
hostile
takeover
(repealed
Code
30


section
490.624A).
It
provides
that
a
board
of
directors
may
31


fix
the
record
date
for
determining
when
shareholders
are
32


entitled
to

DOMESTICATION
AND
CONVERSION.
The
bill
provides
a
procedure
2


referred
to
as
domestication
which
allows
an
entity
organized
3


under
Iowa
law
to
change
its
state
of
incorporation
(to
become
4


foreign)
to
another
state
or
to
allow
an
entity
incorporated
5


in
another
state
to
be
incorporated
in
Iowa
(new
Code
sections
6


490.920
through
490.924).
It
also
rewrites
provisions
for
7


the
process
of
conversion
in
which
a
domestic
corporation
may
8


become
another
type
of
entity
or
a
foreign
entity
which
is
not
9


a
corporation
may
become
a
domestic
corporation
(Iowa
Code
10


sections
490.1111
through
490.1114
repealed
and
replaced
by
new
11


Code
sections
490.930
through
490.935).
12


FOREIGN
CORPORATIONS.
The
bill
eliminates
the
term
13


“certificate
of
authorization”
issued
to
a
foreign
corporation,
14


replaces
that
term
with
“certificate
of
registration”,
and
15


includes
specific
requirements
for
that
document
(Code
section
16


490.128).
It
repeals
a
number
of
provisions
relating
to
the
17


issuance
or
revocation
of
such
authorization,
including
the
18


withdrawal
of
a
foreign
corporation’s
authorization
(Code
19


section
490.1520),
the
transfer
of
a
foreign
corporation’s
20


authorization
to
transact
business
in
this
state
(Code
section
21


490.1523),
the
grounds
or
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
22


authority
(Code
section
490.1530),
the
procedure
for
such
23


revocation
(Code
section
490.1531),
and
a
process
to
repeal
24


that
revocation
(Code
section
490.1532).
25


MERGERS
AND
SHARE
EXCHANGES
WITHOUT
SHAREHOLDER
APPROVAL.
26


The
bill
amends
provisions
allowing
for
both
mergers
(the
27


combination
or
consolidation
of
two
or
more
entities
into
a


28


new
entity)
and
a
share
exchange
(a
transaction
in
which
two
29


corporations
exchange
shares
or
securities
which
results
in
one
30


corporation
controlling
the
acquired
corporation
while
each
31


corporation
remains
in
existence).
The
bill
allows
a
merger
or
32


share
exchange
without
a
shareholder
vote
in
addition
to
the
33


current
short
form
exception
that
allows
such
a
transaction
34


only
if
the
acquiring
corporation
would
own
90
percent
of
the

S.F.
_____


shares
in
the
other
corporation
after
the
transaction.
Under
1


the
bill,
the
transaction
is
allowed,
so
long
as
a
number
2


of
conditions
are
satisfied
(amended
Code
sections
490.1101
3


through
490.1108
and
unamended
sections
490.1108A
through
4


490.1110).
The
merger
or
share
exchange
must
follow
the
tender
5


offer
and
be
made
on
the
terms
provided
in
the
plan
of
merger
6


or
share
exchange,
and
the
offeror
must
acquire
enough
shares
7


to
permit
it
to
approve
the
merger
or
share
exchange
as
if
the
8


matter
were
submitted
to
a
vote
at
a
meeting
of
shareholders.
9


It
would
also
allow
for
a
subsidiary
corporation
to
merge
with
10


an
unincorporated
parent
entity
without
the
approval
of
the
11


subsidiary
corporation’s
board
of
directors
or
shareholders
12


(amended
Code
section
490.1105).
13


APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.
The
bill
amends
provisions
that
allow
14


a
minority
(dissenting)
shareholder
to
assert
appraisal
15


rights
which
triggers
a
payout
for
the
fair
value
for
the
16


shareholder’s
shares
under
limited
circumstances
where
a
17


material
change
in
the
relationship
between
the
corporation
18


and
the
shareholder
is
proposed
(e.g.,
in
the
case
of
a
merger
19


or
share
exchange).
The
bill
provides
that
a
domestication
20


or
conversion
to
an
unincorporated
entity
also
triggers
that
21


right
(Code
section
490.1302).
It
also
limits
the
right
to
an
22


appraisal
if
the
corporate
action
involves
the
distribution
of
23


the
corporation’s
net
assets
to
the
shareholders.
24


DISSOLUTION.
The
bill
allows
the
board
of
directors
to
fix
25


a
record
date
to
determine
shareholder
distribution
so
long
as
26


it
is
not
made
retroactive
(amended
Code
section
490.1405).
It
27


also
requires
the
board
to
make
reasonable
payment
of
claims
28


and
distributions
in
liquidations
of
assets
to
shareholders
29


after
satisfying
claims
(amended
Code
section
490.1409).
30


The
bill
largely
retains
the
current
provision
allowing
for
31


reinstatement
following
administrative
dissolution
(amended
32


Code
section
490.1422).
33


RECORDS
AND
REPORTS.
The
bill
amends
provisions
which
allow
34


for
the
inspection
of
corporate
records
by
shareholders
(e.g.,

minutes
of
meetings,
records
of
action
taken
without
3


a
board
or
committee
meeting,
and
financial
statements).
The
4


bill
provides
that
the
corporation
may
impose
reasonable
5


restrictions
upon
a
shareholder’s
request,
including
6


confidentiality
and
the
use
distribution
of
such
records
7


(amended
Code
sections
490.1601
and
490.1602).
It
eliminates
8


a
requirement
that
a
corporation
deliver
or
make
available
9


to
shareholders
the
corporation’s
annual
financial
statement
10


(amended
Code
section
490.1620).
It
does
not
adopt
the
new
11


MBCA’s
provisions
relating
to
annual
reports
but
retains
and
12


revises
the
provision
requiring
corporations
to
prepare
and
13


deliver
biennial
reports
to
the
secretary
of
state
(amended
14


Code
section
490.1622).
15


BENEFIT
CORPORATIONS.
The
bill
authorizes
benefit
16


corporations.
A
benefit
corporation
allows
an
entity
to
be
17


formed
as
a
corporation
but
requires
directors
to
consider,
in
18


addition
to
shareholder
interests,
the
social,
environmental,
19


and
other
effects
of
corporate
activity,
and
allows
business
20


decisions
to
be
based
on
such
effects,
even
where
those
21


decisions
may
be
contrary
to
the
financial
interests
of
22


shareholders
(new
Code
sections
490.1701
through
490.1706).
23


In
order
to
become
or
stop
from
being
a
benefit
corporation,
24


the
articles
of
incorporation
must
be
amended
by
a
two-thirds
25


vote
of
all
outstanding
shares
of
the
corporation
entitled
to
26


vote
on
the
question
(new
Code
section
490.1703).
A
benefit
27


corporation
is
required
to
prepare
an
annual
benefit
report
28


that
addresses
the
efforts
of
the
corporation
during
the
29


preceding
year,
which
may
be
based
on
a
third-party
standard
30


(new
Code
section
490.1705).
31


TRANSITIONAL
PROVISIONS.
The
bill
includes
a
number
of


32


transitional
provisions.
This
includes
exceptions
from
its
33


provisions,
including
county
and
district
fairs
(Code

entities
organized

(Code

SPECIAL
STAGGERED
TERMS
FOR
DIRECTORS.
The
bill
amends
a
7


provision
that
allowed
a
special
staggered
term
requirement
for
8


directors
of
a
public
corporation
(2011
Iowa
Acts,

On

the

that
allowed
for
the
special

Under
the
bill,
those
Code
sections
will
be
