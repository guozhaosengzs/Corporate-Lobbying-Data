(county
31


sheriff
or
commissioner
of
public
safety)
shall
issue
a
permit
32

discretion
of
the
issuing
1


officer
even
if
the
applicant
meets
the
other
requirements
2


of
Code
chapter

The
bill
allows
the
issuing
officer
to
3


suspend
or
revoke
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
if
the
issuing
4


officer
determines
the
conditions
for
the
issuance
of
the
5


permit
to
carry
weapons
no
longer
exist.
6


Current
law
also
provides
that
an
issuing
officer
shall
7


issue
a
permit
to
acquire
pistols
or
revolvers
immediately
upon
8


completion

the
issuance
of
a
permit
to
11


acquire
pistols
or
revolvers
at
the
discretion
of
the
issuing
12


officer.
13


The
bill
strikes
language
that
requires
the
issuing
officer
14


to
reinstate
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
or
a
permit
to
acquire
15


pistols
or
revolvers
if
the
suspension
of
the
permit
is
16


based
upon
an
arrest
or
proceeding
that
does
not
result
in
a
17


disqualifying
conviction
or
finding
against
the
permit
holder.
18


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
appeals
the
decision
by
19


the
issuing
officer
to
deny
an
application
for
a
permit
to
20


carry
weapons
or
a
permit

who
suspends
or
revokes
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
or
a
permit
22


to
acquire
pistols
or
revolvers,
and
it
is
later
determined
23


on

that
the

is
eligible
to
be
issued
or
possess
24


a
permit
to
carry

loses
or
withdraws
27


such
an
appeal,
the
government
shall
be
awarded
court
costs
28


and
reasonable
attorney
fees.
The
bill
strikes
the
provision
29


relating
to
awarding
court
costs
and
reasonable
attorney
30


fees
to
the
prevailing
party
in
an
appeal
for
the
denial,
31


suspension,
or
revocation
of
a
permit
to
carry
weapons
or
a
32


permit
to
acquire
pistols
or
revolvers
but
does
not
modify
the
33


provision
allowing
for
such
an
appeal.
