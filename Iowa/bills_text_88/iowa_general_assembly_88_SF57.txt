MISTREATMENT
OF
ANIMALS
——
INCREASE
IN
CRIMINAL
PENALTIES.
17


Currently,
the
criminal
penalty
for
a
conviction
of
animal
18


abuse
is
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
This
bill
provides
that
19


the
criminal
penalty
for
a
second
or
subsequent
conviction
for
20


that
offense
is
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony.
The
current
21


criminal
penalty
for
a
conviction
of
animal
negligence
is
a
22


simple
misdemeanor,
unless
the
convicted
person’s
actions
23


resulted
in
a
serious
injury
to
the
animal
or
the
animal’s
24


death.
In
the
instance
in
which
an
animal
is
inflicted
25


with
a
serious
injury,
the
bill
increases
the
enhanced
26


criminal
penalty
from
a
serious
misdemeanor
to
an
aggravated
27


misdemeanor.
Currently,
the
criminal
penalty
for
animal
28


torture
is
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
for
the
first
conviction
29


which
is
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony
for
a
second
or
30


subsequent
conviction.
For
each
conviction,
the
court’s
31


sentencing
order
must
provide
that
the
guilty
person
submit
32


to
psychological
evaluation
and
treatment,
and
for
the
first
33


conviction
the
order
must
require
the
guilty
person
complete
34


a
community
work
requirement.
The
bill
provides
the
criminal
35

penalty
is
a
class
“D”
felony
without
regard
to
the
number
1


of
prior
convictions
and
eliminates
the
enhanced
penalty
2


provision.
The
bill
also
makes
certain
changes
in
terminology
3


for
purposes
of
consistency
and
readability.
