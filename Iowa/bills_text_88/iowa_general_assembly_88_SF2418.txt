this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
governmental
and
regulatory
matters.
4


The
bill
is
organized
into
divisions.
5


DIVISION
I
——
PROFESSIONAL
LICENSING.
This
division
relates
6


to
the
granting
of
professional
licenses,
certifications,
and
7


registrations.
8


DISQUALIFICATIONS
FOR
CRIMINAL
CONVICTIONS.
The
bill
9


provides
that
a
person
can
only
be
disqualified
from
holding
a
10


professional
license
or
have
a
professional
license
revoked
for
11


conviction
of
a
crime
under
certain
circumstances.
In
order
12


for
a
conviction
of
a
crime
to
serve
as
a
disqualification
13


from
holding
a
professional
license,
the
actions
taken
in
14


furtherance
of
the
crime
must
be
actions
which
are
customarily
15


performed
within
the
scope
of
practice
of
a
licensed
profession
16


or
the
offense
must
have
been
committed
under
circumstances
17


that
are
customary
to
a
licensed
profession.
The
bill
requires
18


a
licensing
board
that
may
disqualify
an
applicant
on
the
basis
19


of
a
criminal
conviction
to
provide
a
list
of
the
convictions
20


that
may
disqualify
an
applicant.
If
an
applicant
would
21


otherwise
be
disqualified
from
holding
a
professional
license,
22


the
bill
requires
the
issuing
board
to
grant
an
exception
if
23


the
board
determines
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
24


applicant
is
rehabilitated
and
an
appropriate
candidate
for
25


licensure.
The
bill
allows
a
person
to
submit
a
form
to
the
26


appropriate
licensing
board
to
determine
whether
that
person’s
27


conviction
of
the
crime
would
serve
to
disqualify
that
person
28


from
holding
a
professional
license.
The
bill
prohibits
a
29


board
from
denying
a
license
on
the
basis
of
an
arrest
not
30


followed
by
a
conviction
or
on
the
applicant’s
lack
of
good
31


character.

or
three
24


or
more

a
substantially

similar
scope
of
practice
if
the
person
practiced

profession
in
a
state

as
27


determined
