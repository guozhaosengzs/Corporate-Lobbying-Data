2


time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
that
are
narrowly
tailored
3


in
furtherance
of
a
significant
institutional
interest,
4


shall
allow
members
of
the
campus
community
to
engage
in
5


spontaneous
expressive
activity
and
to
distribute
literature,
6


shall
provide
for

alternative
means
of

and
7


shall
not
designate
any

a
free-speech
zone
or
8


otherwise
create
policies
restricting
expressive
activities
to
9


a
particular

Such
provisions
shall
10


not
be
construed
to
grant
individuals
the
right
to
disrupt
the
11


expressive
activity
of
a

organization
if
the

15


An

campus
community
may
bring
an
action
16


against
the
institution
responsible
for
a
violation
of
the

and
may
assert
such

19


Such

21


However,
nothing

——
INAPPLICABILITY
PROVISION.
The
bill
may
24


include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
section
25B.3.
The
25


bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
subsection
3,
which
26


would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
complying
with
a
27


state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
the
state
mandate
is
28


not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
political
subdivisions
29


are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
mandate
included
in
the
30


bill.
31


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
