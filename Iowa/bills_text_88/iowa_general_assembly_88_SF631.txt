The

section
422.12C(4)
increases
the
Iowa
net

13


levels
for
purposes

dependent
14


child
care
tax
credit
and
the
early

development
tax
15


credit
available
against
the
individual
income

The
Iowa
16


child
and
dependent

tax
credit
is
a
refundable
credit
17


calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
nonrefundable
federal

18


and
dependent

tax
credit,
depending
on
the
Iowa
net
income
19


of
the
taxpayer.
The
early
childhood
development
tax
credit
20


is
a
refundable
credit
equaling
25
percent
of
the
first
$1,000
21


which
the

has
paid

IOWA
CHILD

CARE
TAX
CREDIT.
Currently,
24


there
are
seven
graduated
Iowa
net
income
thresholds
used
to
25


calculate
the
credit.
The
bill
increases
these
graduated

thresholds,
but
does
not
change
the

of
the
27


nonrefundable

child

tax
credit
28


used
to
calculate
the
Iowa

Currently,
the

in
these

range

of

of

Under

of
the
federal

of
$50,980
or

5


The
bill
also
adjusts
the
future
amount
of
each

the
Iowa

in
the

EARLY

The
bill
increases

the
income
threshold
determining
the
eligibility
of
a

10


for
the

The

increases
the
eligibility
threshold
from
a
taxpayer
earning
12


$45,000
per
year
to
$57,360
per
year.
By
increasing
the
13


eligibility
threshold,
taxpayers
earning
less
than
$57,360
are
14


now
eligible
to
take
the
early

tax
credit
15


equaling
25
percent
of
the

paid
to

each

The

DIVISION

——
APPORTIONMENT
OF
CERTAIN
BUSINESS
INCOME
24


OF
AN
AIRLINE.
The
amendment
to
Code
section
422.33(2)(a)(2)
25


relates
to
the
apportionment
of
income
of
an
airline
and
of
26


a
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
for
purposes
of
the
Iowa
27


corporate
income
tax.
28


A
corporation
doing
business
both
within
and

Iowa
is
29


required
to
apportion
its
business
income
among
Iowa
and
the
30


other
states
in
which
it
does
business.
The
amount
of

is
generally
in

32


as
the
business’s
gross

if
the
business
33


involves

if
the

involves
something
other
than
the
1


manufacture

of

However,
airlines
2


and
other
specified
industries
have
special
rules
provided
3


by
administrative
rule
for
apportioning
the
income
of
those
4


industries.
5


Under
current
law
pursuant
to
701
Iowa
administrative
code,
6


rule
54.7(2),
an
airline
deriving
income
from
transportation
7


operations
is
required
to
apportion
its
business
income
to
8


Iowa
in
the
same
proportion
that
its
mileage
traveled
in
Iowa
9


bears
to
its
total
mileage
traveled
everywhere.
The
bill
10


specifies
that
an
airline
shall
apportion
this
business
income
11


in
the
same
manner
described
above
as
required
under
701
Iowa
12


administrative
code,
rule
54.7(2).
13


The
bill
also
provides
rules
for
apportioning
income
derived
14


by
a
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
from
transportation
15


operations
through
an
affiliated
airline.
The
bill
defines
16


“qualified
air
freight
forwarder”
to
be
a
taxpayer
that
is
17


primarily
engaged
in
the
facilitation
of
the
transportation
of
18


property
by
air,
and
that
does
not
itself
operate
aircraft
but
19


that
is
in
the
same
affiliated
group
as
an
airline.
20


The
bill
states
that
the
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
21


income
derived
from
transportation
operations
shall
be
22


apportioned
to
Iowa
either
under
the
current
rules
of
the
23


director
of
revenue
(current
statutory
rules),
or
in
the
24


same
proportion
that
the
miles
of
the
qualified
air
freight
25


forwarder’s
affiliated
airline
traveled
in
this
state
bears
to
26


the
total
miles
of
the
affiliated
airline
traveled

(affiliated

REPEAL.
Current

an
AMT
on
a

institution
to
the
extent
the
AMT
exceeds
the
financial

institution’s

The

is
generally

calculated

items
(deductions,

back
to

applying
an

The

repeal
the
AMT
for
the

beginning

year

11


Current

also
provides
an

which
