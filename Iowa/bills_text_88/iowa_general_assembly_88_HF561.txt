deficiency
within
3


the
easement
strip
shall
not
be
precluded
from
renegotiation
4


under
section
6B.52
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
apparent
at
the
5


time
of
settlement
unless
the
settlement
expressly
releases
the
6


pipeline
company
from
claims
for
damage
to
the

the
soil.
The

21


the

conducted
30


by

commission

determine
damages
caused
