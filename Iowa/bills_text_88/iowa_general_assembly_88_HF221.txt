A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
2


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
3


and
a

II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
4


substance
that

States.
The
reclassification
of

from
a

I

controlled
substance
to
a

II
controlled
substance
7


would
allow
a

However,
federal

may
prohibit

such

The

of

depending
on
the
amount
of

involved
in
the
offense.

The

amends
Code
section
