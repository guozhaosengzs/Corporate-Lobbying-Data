the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
the
regulation
of
professional
licenses
2


in
Iowa
including
the
recognition
of
out-of-state
licenses
and
3


disqualification
provisions
for
criminal
convictions.
4


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
can
only
be
disqualified
5


from
holding
a
professional
license
or
have
a
professional
6


license
revoked
for
conviction
of
a
crime
under
certain
7


circumstances.
In
order
for
a
conviction
of
a
crime
to
serve
8


as
a
disqualification
from
holding
a
professional
license,
the
9


actions
taken
in
furtherance
of
the
crime
must
be
actions
which
10


are
customarily
performed
by
the
licensed
profession
or
the
11


offense
must
have
been
committed
under
circumstances
that
are
12


customary
to
the
profession.
The
bill
requires
a
licensing
13


board
that
may
disqualify
an
applicant
on
the
basis
of
a
14


criminal
conviction
to
provide
a
list
of
the
convictions
that
15


may
disqualify
an
applicant.
If
an
applicant
would
otherwise
16


be
disqualified
from
holding
a
professional
license,
the
bill
17


requires
the
issuing
board
to
grant
an
exception
if
the
board
18


determines
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
applicant
19


is
rehabilitated
and
an
appropriate
candidate
for
licensure.
20


The
bill
allows
a
person
to
submit
a
form
to
the
appropriate
21


licensing
board
to
determine
whether
that
person’s
conviction
22


of
the
crime
would
serve
to
disqualify
that
person
from
holding
23


a
professional
license.
24


The
bill
strikes
specific
provisions
regarding
25

holding
a
professional
license

and

1


The
bill
requires
a
licensing
board
to
grant
a
professional
2


license
to
a
person
from
out
of
state
who:
establishes
3


residency
in
Iowa;
currently
holds
a
substantially
equivalent
4


license
from
another
jurisdiction;
is
in
good
standing
in
5


all
jurisdictions
where
the
person
is
licensed;
completed
6


minimum
educational,
work,
and
clinical
requirements;
passed
7


an
examination
required
by
the
jurisdiction;
has
not
had
a
8


license
revoked
or
voluntarily
surrendered
a
license
while
9


under
investigation;
has
not
had
discipline
imposed,
unless
the
10


issue
has
been
resolved;

not
have
a

11


or
investigation
pending
against
the
person;
pays
applicable
12


fees;
and
does
not
have
a
disqualifying
conviction.
The
bill
13


allows
a
board
to
require
a
person
licensed
in
another
state
to
14


pass
the
relevant
board’s
licensing
exam
on
Iowa
law
and
submit
15


fingerprints.
A
person
who
receives
a
license
in
Iowa
pursuant
16


to
this
process
is
not
eligible
to
practice
in
another
state
17


under
an
interstate
licensure
compact.
18


The
bill
requires
a
licensing
board
to
waive
the
application
19


fee
for
an
applicant
for
a
license
if
the
applicant’s
household
20


income
does
not
exceed
200
percent
of
the
federal
poverty
level
21


and
the
person
has
not
previously
applied
for
the
same
license
22


in
Iowa.
23


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2021.
