a
free-speech

8


restricting

construed
to
10


grant

the
right
to
disrupt
the
expressive
activity
11


of
a

organization
if
the

An

——
INAPPLICABILITY
PROVISION.
The
bill
may
27


include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
section
25B.3.
The


28

makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
subsection
3,
which
29


would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from

with
a
30


state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
the
state
mandate
is
31


not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
political
subdivisions
32


are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
mandate
included
in
the
33


bill.
34


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
