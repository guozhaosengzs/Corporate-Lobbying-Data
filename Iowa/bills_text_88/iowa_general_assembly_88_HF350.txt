ELECTION
OF
COMMISSIONERS.
The
bill
removes
the
prohibition
6


against
more
than
one
commissioner
residing
in
the
same
7


township,
requiring
only
residence
within
the
district
to
be
8


eligible
for
election
at
large
to
the
office
of
commissioner.
9


Provisions
relating
to
appointments
for
vacancies
in
the
10


office
of
commissioner
are
changed
to
allow
for
appointments
11


to
be
made
by
the
remaining
commissioners,
not
the
state
soil
12


conservation
committee.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
person
13


appointed
does
not
serve
out
the
full
remaining
term,
but
14


only
for
the
time
until
the
next
succeeding
general
election.
15


Appointed
commissioners
are
then
able
to
stand
for

16


they
so
choose.
17


COMMISSIONERS,
BOARDS,
AND
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
——
18


ESTABLISHING
AND
ENFORCING
SOIL
LOSS
LIMITS.
The
commissioners
19


are
to
establish
criteria
for
determining
what
constitutes
20


significant
soil
loss
for
land
located
within
the
district,
21


including
soil
loss
caused
by
erosion
occurring
on
neighboring
22


land.
The
commissioners
are
to
adopt
a
regulation
establishing
23


soil
loss
limits
which
shall
be
not
more
than
five
tons
per
24


acre
during
any
12-month
period.
The
regulations
establishing
25


soil
loss
limits
are
no
longer
required
to
be
approved
by
the
26


committee.


27


The
commissioners
must
perform
an
inspection
of
land
located
28


in
their
district
after
receipt
of
a
written
complaint
or
upon
29


a
majority
vote
at
an
open
meeting.
After
the
inspection,
30


the
commissioners
must
issue
an
administrative
order
against
31


a
person
if
the
commissioners
find
the
loss
of
soil
exceeds
32


the
soil
loss
limit
for
the
land
in
question.
The
order
must
33


describe
the
commissioners’
findings,
be
delivered
to
the
34


person
responsible
for
causing
the
soil
loss,
and
establish
a
35

period
for
compliance
with
the
order.
Evidence
of
compliance
1


with
the
order
includes
applying
for
public
moneys,
such
as
2


cost-share
financing,
in
order
to
defray
a
portion
of
the
costs
3


associated
with
complying
with
the
order.
The
bill
requires
4


the
commissioners
to
give
preference
to
applications
which
seek
5


to
comply
with
an
administrative
order.
6


After
the
compliance
period
expires,
if
work
to
comply
7


with
the
order
is
not
being
performed,
the
commissioners
must
8


enforce
the
order
by
referring
the
matter
to
the
attorney
9


general
or
the
board
of
supervisors
in
the
county
in
which
10


the
land
is
located.
A
person
whose
land
is
damaged
due
to
11


neighboring
land’s
erosion
may
also
petition
the
board
of
12


supervisors
to
enforce
the
order.
If
the
board
takes
action
13


to
enforce
compliance
with
the
order,
the
board
must
notify
14


the
county
treasurer
of
the
costs
associated
with
taking
its
15


action.
The
treasurer
must
enter
an
amount
equal
to
the
costs
16


plus
a
5
percent
penalty
on
the
tax
books,
which
shall
be
17


collected
as
ordinary
taxes
and
constitutes
a
lien
against
18


the
property.
However,
the
board
of
supervisors
may
instead
19


refer
the
matter
to
the
attorney
general.
The
commissioners,
20


or
the
board
or
attorney
general
acting
under
a
referral,
must
21


petition
the
district
court
to
enforce
the
order.

The
highest

is
to
be

to
30

in
high-priority
watersheds
identified
by
the
31


water
resources
coordinating

(Code
