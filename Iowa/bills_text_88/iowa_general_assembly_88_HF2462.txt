is

read
as
follows:

a.
Duration
of
benefits.
The
maximum
total
amount
of
3


benefits
payable
to
an
eligible
individual
during
a
benefit
4


year
shall
not
exceed
the
total
of
the
wage
credits
accrued
5


to
the
individual’s
account
during
the
individual’s
base
6


period,
or
twenty-six
times
the

weekly
benefit
7


amount,
whichever
is
the
lesser.
The
director
shall
maintain
8


a
separate
account
for
each
individual
who
earns
wages
in
9


insured
work.
The
director
shall
compute
wage
credits
for
10


each
individual
by
crediting
the

account
with
11


one-third
of
the
wages
for
insured
work
paid
to
the
individual
12


during
the
individual’s
base
period.
However,
the
director


13


shall
recompute

credits
for
an
individual
who

off
due
to
the
individual’s
employer
going
out
of
business
at
15


the
factory,
establishment,
or
other
premises
at
which
the
16


individual
was

by
crediting
the
individual’s
17


account
with
one-half,
instead
of
one-third,
of
the
wages
for


18


insured
work
paid
to
the
individual
during
the
individual’s


19


base
period.
Benefits
paid
to
an
eligible
individual
shall
20


be
charged
against
the
base
period
wage
credits
in
the
21


individual’s
account
which
have
not
been
previously
charged,
22


in
the
inverse
chronological
order
as

wages
on
which
the
23


wage
credits
are
based
were
paid.
However
if
the
state
“off”


24


indicator
is
in
effect
and
if

is
laid

due
to
25


the
individual’s
employer
going
out
of
business
at
the
factory,
26


establishment,
or
other
premises
at
which
the
individual
was
27


last
employed,
the
maximum
benefits
payable
shall
be
extended
28


to
thirty-nine
times
the
individual’s
weekly
benefit
amount,
29


but
not
to
exceed
the
total
of
the
wage
credits
accrued
to
the


30


individual’s
account.

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
strikes
language
requiring
the
director
of
the
3


department
of
workforce
development
to
recompute
wage
credits
4


for
purposes
of
calculating
an
individual’s
maximum
total
5


amount
of
unemployment
benefits
payable
during
a
benefit
year.
6


The
stricken
language
applied
to
an
individual
who
is
laid
7


off
due
to
the
individual’s
employer
going
out
of
business
at
8


the
factory,
establishment,
or
other
premises
at
which
the
9


individual
was
last
employed
by
crediting
the
individual’s
10


account
with
one-half,
instead
of
one-third,
of
the
wages
for
11


insured
work
paid
to
the
individual
during
the
individual’s
12


base
period.
The
bill
also
strikes
language
providing
an
13


additional
13
weeks
of
benefits
to
such
individuals
if
the
14


state
“off”
indicator,
which
relates
to
the
rate
of
insured
15


unemployment
in
the
state,
is
in
effect.
The
bill
applies
to
16


any
week
of
unemployment
benefits
beginning
on
or
after
the
17


first
Sunday
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
