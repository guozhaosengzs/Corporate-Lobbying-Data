EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


This
bill
amends
the
definition
of
a
credit-sale
contract
14


which
involves
an
instrument
used
in
commercial
transactions
15


involving
the
marketing
of
grain.
The
department
of
16


agriculture
and
land
stewardship
regulates
both
grain
dealers
17


(Code
chapter
203)
and
warehouse
operators
(Code
chapter
18


203C)
as
well
as
administers
the
grain
depositors
and
sellers
19


indemnity
fund
(fund)
(Code
chapter
203D).
20


Under
a
credit-sale
contract,
grain
is
delivered
to
a
buyer
21


(licensed
grain
dealer)
who
receives
title
but
does
not
pay
22


the
sales
price
to
the
seller
for
30
or
more
days
from
the
23


date
of
delivery
(e.g.,
for
storage
in
a
licensed
warehouse).
24


A
transaction
may
involve
a
deferred-payment
contract
in
25


which
the
contract
price
is
fixed
at
the
time
of
sale
and
a
26


deferred-pricing
contract
or
price-later
contract
in
which
the
27


sale
price
is
not
fixed
at
the
time
of
sale
(e.g.,
determined
28


on
the
basis
of
a
future
market
price).
The
bill
provides
29


that
a
deferred-payment
contract
is
no
longer
considered
a
30


credit-sale
contract.
A
licensed
grain
dealer
purchasing
31


grain
under
a
deferred-payment
contract
would
not
be
subject
32


to
special
regulation
otherwise
applicable
to
credit-sale
33


contracts
under
Code
section
203.15.
A
seller
would
also
be


34


entitled
to
coverage
under
the
fund
for
90
percent
of
losses
