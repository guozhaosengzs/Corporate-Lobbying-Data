S.F.
2205


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


Under
current
law,
the
definition
of
“bicycle”
includes
2


a
device
with
fully
operable
pedals
and
an
electric
motor
of
3


less
than
750
watts
with
a
maximum
speed
of
less
than
20
miles
4


per
hour
when
powered
solely
by
the
electric
motor.
This
5


bill
strikes
that
provision
and
includes
low-speed
electric
6


bicycles
within
the
definition
of
“bicycle”.
The
bill
defines
7


the
term
“low-speed
electric
bicycle”,
including
three
defined
8


classes.
The
bill
excludes
low-speed
electric
bicycles
from
9


the
definition
of
“vehicle”
under
Code
section
321.1,
thereby
10


making
the
provisions
of
Code
chapter
321
(motor
vehicles
11


and
law
of
the
road)
relating
to
vehicles,
motor
vehicles,
12


automobiles,
cars,
motorcycles,
and
motorized
bicycles
13


inapplicable
to
low-speed
electric
bicycles.
14


Because
the
bill
includes
low-speed
electric
bicycles
within
15


the
definition
of
“bicycle”,
a
person
operating
a
low-speed
16


electric
bicycle
on
a
highway
is
subject
to
the
provisions
17


of
Code
chapter
321
applicable
to
a
rider
of
a
bicycle
on
a
18


highway
and
has
all
the
rights
and
duties
under
Code
chapter
19


321
applicable
to
a
rider
of
a
bicycle.
Under
Code
section
20


321.234,
a
person
riding
a
bicycle
on
a
highway
is
subject
21


to
the
provisions
of
Code
chapter
321
and
has
all
the
rights
22


and
duties
applicable
to
a
driver
of
a
vehicle,
except
those
23


provisions
which
by
their
nature
can
have
no
application.
Code
24


section
321.234
prohibits
a
person
from
using
a
bicycle
on
a
25


highway
to
carry
more
persons
at
one
time
than
the
number
of
26


persons
for
which
the
bicycle
is
designed
and
equipped.
Code
27


section
321.281
prohibits
a
person
operating
a
motor
vehicle
28


from
steering
the
motor
vehicle
unreasonably
close
to
or
toward
29


a
person
riding
a
bicycle
on
a
highway,
including
the
roadway
30


or
the
shoulder
adjacent
to
the
roadway,
and
prohibits
a
person
31


from
knowingly
projecting
any
object
or
substance
at
or
against
32


a
person
riding
a
bicycle
on
a
highway.
Code
section
321.397
33


requires
bicycles
to
at
certain
times
be
equipped
with
a
lamp
34


on
the
front
exhibiting
a
white
light
and
a
lamp

exhibiting
a

except
that
a
red
reflector
may
be
used
1


in
lieu
of
a
rear
light.
Code
section
321.434
prohibits
a
2


bicycle
from
being
equipped
with,
and
a
person
from
using
upon
3


a
bicycle,
any
siren
or
whistle.
4


By
operation
of
law,
a
local
authority
is
authorized
to
5


regulate
low-speed
electric
bicycles
under
Code
section
6


321.236(10).
7


Beginning
January
1,
2021,
the
bill
requires
manufacturers
8


and
distributors
of
low-speed
electric
bicycles
to
apply
a
9


label
to
each
low-speed
electric
bicycle
identifying
the
10


class
of
the
bicycle,
the
bicycle’s
top
assisted
speed,
and
11


the
bicycle’s
motor
wattage.
The
bill
further
prohibits
a
12


person
from
modifying
the
speed
capability
or
engagement
of
a
13


low-speed
electric
bicycle
such
that
the
low-speed
electric
14


bicycle
does
not
qualify
for
a
class
as
provided
for
in
the
15


bill.
A
person
who
has
modified
the
speed
capability
or
16


engagement
of
a
low-speed
electric
bicycle
must
affix
a
new
17


label
containing
the
required
information
as
provided
for
in
18


the
bill
to
the
modified
low-speed
electric
bicycle.
19


The
bill
also
requires
that
low-speed
electric
bicycles
20


be
manufactured
in
compliance
with
16
C.F.R.
pt.
1512
and
be
21


manufactured
to
operate
in
such
a
manner
that
when
the
rider
22


stops
pedaling,
applies
the
brakes,
or
the
electric
motor
is
23


disengaged,
the
electric
motor
assist
ceases
to
function.
A
24


violation
of
the
label
and
manufacturing
requirements
of
the
25


bill
is
punishable
as
a
fraudulent
practice.
26


The
bill
provides
that
a
class
3
low-speed
electric
bicycle
27


shall
not
be
operated
unless
it
is
equipped
with
a
speedometer
28


that
displays
its
speed
in
miles
per
hour.
The
bill
also
29


prohibits
persons
under
the
age
of
16
from
operating
a
class
30


3
low-speed
electric
bicycle.
However,
such
persons
may
ride
31


as
a
passenger
on
a
class
3
low-speed
electric
bicycle.
A
32


violation
of
these
operating
provisions
is
punishable
by
a
33


scheduled
fine
of
$15.
