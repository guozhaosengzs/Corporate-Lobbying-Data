b.
A

A
distribution
shall
not
be
made
if,
after
giving
it
1


effect,
any
of
the
following
would
result:
2


a.
The
corporation
would
not
be
able
to
pay
its
debts
as
3


they
become
due
in
the
usual
course
of
business.
4


b.
The
corporation’s
total
assets
would
be
less
than
5


the
sum
of
its
total
liabilities
plus,
unless
the
articles
6


of
incorporation
permit
otherwise,
the
amount
that
would
be
7


needed,
if
the
corporation
were
to
be
dissolved
at
the
time

of
the
distribution,
to
satisfy
the
preferential
rights
upon
9


dissolution
of
shareholders
whose
preferential
rights
are
10


superior
to
those
receiving
the
distribution.

The
board
of
directors
may
base
a
determination
12


that
a
distribution
is
not
prohibited
under
subsection

13


either
on
financial
statements
prepared
on
the
basis
of

accounting
practices

that

reasonable
in

circumstances

Except
as
provided
in
subsection
7,
the
effect
of
a
18


distribution
under
subsection
3
is
measured
as
follows:
19


a.
In
the
case
of
distribution
by
purchase,
redemption,
20


or
other
acquisition
of
the
corporation’s
shares,
as
of
the
21


earlier
of
the
following:
22


(1)
The
date
cash
or
other
property
is
transferred
or
debt
23

a
shareholder
is
incurred
by
the
corporation.

(2)
The
date
the
shareholder
ceases
to
be
a

respect

the
acquired
shares.
26


b.
In
the
case
of
any
other
distribution
of
indebtedness,
as
27


of
the
date
the
indebtedness
is
distributed.


28


c.
In
all
other
cases,
as
of
the
following:
29


(1)
The
date
the
distribution
is
authorized
if
the
payment
30


occurs
within
one
hundred
twenty
days
after
the
date
of

32


(2)
The
date
the

made
if
it

more
than
one

days
after
the
date
of

Indebtedness

provide
that
payment
of
principal

only
if
and
to
the
extent
that
payment
of
a
distribution
to

shareholders
could
then
be
made

this
section.
If
such
10


indebtedness
is
issued
as
a
distribution,
each
payment
of
11


principal
or
interest
is
treated
as
a
distribution,

which

actually
made.

Upon
determining
the
fair
value
of
the
shares,
the
3


court
shall
enter
an
order
directing
the
purchase
upon
such
4


terms
and
conditions
as
the
court
deems
appropriate,
which
may
5


include
payment
of
the
purchase
price
in
installments,
where
6


necessary
in
the
interests
of
equity,
provision
for
security
7


to
assure
payment
of
the
purchase
price
and
any
additional
8


expenses
as
may
have
been
awarded,
and,
if
the
shares
are
to
9


be
purchased
by
shareholders,
the
allocation
of
shares
among
10


them.
In
allocating
the
petitioner’s
shares
among
holders
of
11


different
classes
or
series
of
shares,
the
court
should
attempt
12


to
preserve
the
existing
distribution
of
voting
rights
among
13


holders
of
different
classes
or
series
insofar
as
practicable
14


and
may
direct
that
holders
of
a
specific
class
or
classes
or
15


series
shall
not
participate
in
the
purchase.
Interest
may
be
16


allowed
at
the
rate
and
from
the
date
determined
by
the
court
17


to
be
equitable,
but
if
the
court
finds
that
the
refusal
of
18


the
petitioning
shareholder
to
accept
an
offer
of
payment
was
19


arbitrary
or
otherwise
not
in
good
faith,
no
interest
shall
be
20


allowed.
If
the
court
finds
that
the
petitioning
shareholder
21


had
probable
grounds
for
relief
under
section
490.1430,
22


subsection
1,
paragraph
“b”
,
subparagraph
(2)
or

it
may

award
expenses
to
the
petitioning
shareholder.

Upon
entry
of
an
order
under
subsection
3
or

the
25


court
shall
dismiss
the
petition
to
dissolve
the
corporation
26


under
section
490.1430,
subsection
1,
paragraph
“b”
,
and
the
27


petitioning
shareholder
shall
no
longer
have
any
rights
or

as
a
shareholder
of
the
corporation,
except
the
right

the

awarded

shall
