science
instruction
that
incorporates
the
computer
science

education
standards
adopted
by
the
state
board
of
education
2


in
at
least
one
grade
at
the
elementary
level
and
at
the
3


middle
school
level.
In
grades
9-12,
commencing
with
the
4


2022-2023
school
year,
one-half
unit
of
computer
science
that
5


incorporates
the
computer
science
education
standards
adopted
6


by
the
state
board
must
be
offered
and
taught,
but
the
one-half
7


unit
may
be
offered
and

online.
8


Each
school
district
and
accredited
nonpublic
school
must
9


develop
and
implement
a
K-12
computer
science
plan
by
July
1,
10


2022.
The
new
language
replaces
obsolete
language
relating
to
11


full
implementation
of
the
core
curriculum
by
the
2014-2015
12


school

13


The
director
of
the
department
is
directed
to
develop
and
14


implement
a
statewide
K-12
computer
science
instruction
plan
by
15


July
1,
2022.
16


The
division
amends
provisions
relating
to
the
online
17


learning
initiative
requirements.
Currently,
the
statute
makes
18


inapplicable
the
educational
standards
for
up
to
two
high
19


school
courses
if
the
school
district
or
school
makes
every
20


reasonable
and
good
faith
effort
but
is
unable
to
employ
a
21


licensed
teacher
for
the
subject,
or
if
fewer
than
10
students
22


typically
register
for
the
subject.
The
division
reduces
the
23


specific
courses
to
which
this
authorization
applies,
but
24


allows
a
school
district
or
school
to
exceed
the
two-subject
25


limit
to
offer
world
language,
personal
finance
literacy,
and
26


computer
science
coursework
online
if
the
school
district
or
27


school,
after
making
every
reasonable
and
good
faith
effort,
28


cannot
employ
a
licensed
teacher
for
the
subject,
or
if
fewer
29


than
10
students
typically
register
for
the
subject.
30


Currently,
the
department
may
waive
the
high
school
subject
31


requirements
for
school
districts
and
schools,
but
the
division
32


limits
the
authority
of
the
department
to
certain
specified
33


subjects.
Currently,
school
districts
and
schools
offering
34


such
online
learning
must
offer
the
coursework
through
an

learning
platform
or

a
private

that
1


meets
statutory
requirements.
The
division
adds
that
any
2


online
learning
entity
may
develop
such
an
online
learning
3


platform.
4


The
department
is
directed
to
convene
a
computer
science
5


work
group
to
develop
recommendations
to
strengthen
computer
6


science
instruction
and
for
the
development
and
implementation
7


of
a
statewide
campaign
to
promote
computer
science
to
K-12
8


students
and
to
the
parents
and
legal
guardians
of
such
9


students.
The
work
group
must
submit
its
findings
to
the
10


general
assembly
by
July
1,
2021.
11


The
division
also
strikes,
effective
July
1,
2021,
language
12


which
requires
that
the
state
board’s
rules
providing
for
the
13


establishment
of
high-quality
standards
for
computer
science
14


education
taught
by
elementary,
middle,
and
high
schools
be
15


applicable
only
to
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic

schools
receiving
