A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
1


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
2


and
a

II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
3


substance
that
has
an

States.
The
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
a
schedule
I
5


controlled
substance
to
a
schedule
II

substance
6


would
allow
a

under

However,
federal

may
prohibit
8


such
prescriptions.

range
from

12


years

to
a

up
to
six
months
of
confinement
depending
on
the
amount
of
14


marijuana
involved
in
the
offense.
15


The

Code
