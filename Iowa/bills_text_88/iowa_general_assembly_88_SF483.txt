This

NEW
CODE
SECTION
216.6B.
The
bill
creates
new
Code
section
9


216.6B
(additional
unfair
or
discriminatory
practice
——
sexual
10


harassment
in
employment)
in
the
Iowa
civil
rights
Act.
The
11


bill
defines
sexual
harassment
similarly
to
Code
section
12


19B.12,
but
does
not
include
the
enumerated
circumstances
that
13


are
set
forth
as
sexual
harassment
in
that
Code
section.
14


The
bill
provides
that
all
employers,
employment
agencies,
15


and
labor
organizations
have
an
obligation
to
ensure
a
16


workplace
that
is
free
from
sexual
harassment.
Furthermore,
17


the
bill
provides
that
all
persons
who
engage
a
person
to
18


perform
work
or
services
have
an
obligation
to
ensure
a
19


working
relationship
with
that
person
that
is
free
from
sexual
20


harassment.
21


The
bill
requires
that
every
employer
adopt
a
written
policy
22


against
sexual
harassment
and
prescribes
what
the
policy
23


must
include.
The
bill
requires
that
the
employer
post
the
24


policy
in
a
prominent
and
accessible
location
in
the
workplace
25


and
provide
an
individual
written
copy
of
the
policy
to
all
26


employees.
The
bill
requires
that
employers
provide
copies
27


of
the
written
policies
to
employees
upon
hire
and
provides
28


written
copies
of
updated
policies
to
employees
when
changes
29


are
made.
These
provisions
of
the
bill
are
not
effective
until
30


one
month
after
the
Iowa
civil
rights
commission
(commission)
31


prepares
and
makes
publicly
available
a
model
policy
and
model
32


poster
regarding
sexual
harassment,
which
is
a
requirement
of
33


the
bill.


34


The
bill
provides
that
an
assertion
that
an
individual
did
35

not
receive
the
information
required
to
be
provided
by
the
bill
1


shall
not
result
in
the
automatic
liability
of
any
employer
2


to
any
current
or
former
employee
or
applicant
in
any
action
3


alleging
sexual
harassment.
The
bill
further
provides
that
4


an
employer’s
compliance
with
the
notice
requirements
of
the
5


bill
does
not
preclude
the
employer
from
liability
for
sexual
6


harassment
of
any
current
or
former
employee
or
applicant.
7


The
bill
encourages
employers
and
labor
organizations
to
8


conduct
annual
education
and
training
programs
on
the
topic
of
9


sexual
harassment.
10


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
shall
not
require
any
11


employee
or
prospective
employee,
as
a
condition
of
employment,
12


to
sign
an
agreement
or
waiver
that
does
any
of
the
following:
13


(1)
prohibits,
prevents,
or
otherwise
restricts
the
employee
or
14


prospective
employee
from
opposing,
disclosing,
reporting,
or
15


participating
in
an
investigation
of
sexual
harassment,
or
(2)
16


except
as
otherwise
permitted
by
state
or
federal
law,
purports
17


to
waive
a
substantive
or
procedural
right
to
remedy
available
18


to
the
employee
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
sexual
harassment.
19


The
bill
sets
forth
what
an
agreement
to
settle
a
sexual
20


harassment
claim
shall
state,
including
that
it
does
not
21


waive
any
rights
or
claims
that
may
arise
after
the
date
the
22


settlement
agreement
is
executed
and
that
it
does
not
prohibit,
23


prevent,
or
otherwise
restrict
the
individual
who
made
the
24


claim
from
exercising
enumerated
rights.
The
bill
provides
25


that
an
agreement
to
settle
a
sexual
harassment
claim
that
26


violates
such
provisions
is
void
and
unenforceable
against
the
27


person
who
made
the
claim.
28


The
bill
provides
that
the
commission,
in
order
to
assess
29


compliance
with
the
provisions
of
this
new
Code
section,
30


shall
be
able
to,
with
48
hours’
notice,
at
reasonable
times
31


and
without
unduly
disrupting
business
operations,
enter

inspect
any
place
of
employment,
question
any
person
who
is
33


authorized
by
the
employer
to
receive
or

34


of

The

requires
the
employer
to

3

without

make
4

to
7


the
prevention
of
sexual
harassment
and
the
requirements
of
8


the
bill
available
to
the
commission
or
designee.
The
bill
9


provides
that
following
such
an
inspection
and
examination,
10


the
commission
shall
notify
the
employer
of
the
results
11


of
the
inspection
and
examination,
including
any
issues
or
12


deficiencies
identified,
provide
resources
regarding
practices
13


and
procedures
for
the
prevention
of
sexual
harassment
that
14


the
employer
may
wish
to
adopt
or
utilize,
and
identify
15


any
technical
assistance
that
the
commission
may
be
able
to
16


provide
to
help
the
employer
address
any
identified
issues
17


or
deficiencies.
The
bill
provides
that
if
the
commission
18


determines
that
it
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
employer’s
19


workplace
is
free
from
sexual
harassment,
the
employer
may
be
20


required,
for
a
period
of
up
to
three
years,
to
provide
an
21


annual

and
training
program
that
satisfies
certain
22


requirements
set
forth
in
the
bill
to
all
employees
or
to
23


conduct
an
annual,
anonymous
