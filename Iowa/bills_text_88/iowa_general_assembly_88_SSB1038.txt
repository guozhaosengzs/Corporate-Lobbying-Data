However,
a
specific
27


suspect
description-based
identification
only
provides
probable
28


cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
person
who
reasonably
29


resembles
the
person
described
in
that
identification,
and
does
30


not
allow
an
officer
to
stop
a
person
merely
because
the
person
31


is
of
the
same
race,
color,
ethnicity,
religion,
or
national
32


origin
as
the
suspect.
33

The
