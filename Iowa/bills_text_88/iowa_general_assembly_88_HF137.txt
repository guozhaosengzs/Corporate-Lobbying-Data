for
the

person
who
is
an

and
12


reveal
the
names
of
either
or
both
of
the
biological
parents
13


following
consideration
of
both
of
the
following:


14


(1)
A
biological
parent
may
file
an
affidavit
requesting
15


that
the
juvenile
court
or
court
reveal
or
not
reveal
the
16


parent’s

The
juvenile

or
court
shall
consider
17


any
such
affidavit
in
determining
whether
there
is
good
cause


18


to
order

To
facilitate
the
biological


19


parents
in
filing
an
affidavit,
the

shall,
upon
20


request
of
a
biological
parent,
provide
the
biological

21


with
an
adoption
information
packet
containing
an

for

completion
and
filing

biological
parents’
identity
has
a
sibling
who
is
a
minor
and
27


who
has
been
adopted
by
the
same
parents,
the
juvenile
court
or
28


court
may
deny
the
application
on
the
grounds
that
revelation
29


to
the
applicant
may
also
indirectly
and
harmfully
permit
the


30


same
revelation
to
the
applicant’s
minor
sibling.
31


c.
A
biological
sibling
of
an
adopted
person
may

request

affidavit
in
the
juvenile

records
34

or

to
the

The
juvenile
court
or
court
shall
consider
any
such
affidavit
2


in
determining
whether
there
is
good
cause
to
order
opening
3


of
the
records
upon
application
for
revelation
by
the
adopted
4


person.
However,
the
name
of
the
biological
sibling
shall
not
5


be
revealed
until
the
biological
sibling
has
attained
majority.
6


d.
The
juvenile
court
or
court
may,
upon
competent
medical
7


evidence,
open
termination
or
adoption
records
if
opening
8


is
shown
to
be
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
or
prevent
9


irreparable
physical
or
mental
harm
to
an
adopted
person
or
10


the
person’s
offspring.
The
juvenile
court
or
court
shall
11


make
every
reasonable
effort
to
prevent
the
identity
of
the
12


biological
parents
from
becoming
revealed
under
this
paragraph
13


to
the
minor


adopted
person.
The
juvenile

14


however,

of
the
identity
of
the
biological
15


parents
to
medical
personnel
attending
the
adopted
person
16


or
the
person’s
offspring.
These
medical
personnel
shall
17


make
every
reasonable
effort
to
prevent
the
identity
of
the
18


biological
parents
from
becoming
revealed
to
the
minor


adopted
19


person.

preclude

upon
the

EXPLANATION
25


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
26


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
27


This
bill
relates
to
adoption.
28


The
bill
replaces
references
to
“husband”
and
“wife”
with
29


“spouse”
in
provisions
relating
to
qualifications
to
file
an
30


adoption
petition.
31


Under
Code
chapter
600
(adoption),
“adult”
is
defined
as
32


a
person
who
is
married
or
18
years
of
age
or
older.
Under
33


current
law,
however,
Code
section
600.16
provides
that
for
34


the
purposes
of
making
available
medical
and
developmental

H.F.
137


history
information
that
was
collected
during
the
preplacement
1


investigation
for
an
adoption,
“adult”
is
defined
as
a
person
2


21
years
of
age
or
older
or
a
person
who
attains
majority
by
3


marriage.
The
bill
eliminates
this
definition
of
“adult”,
4


thereby
defining
adult
as
a
person
who
is
married
or
18
years
5


of
age
or
older
consistently
throughout
the
chapter.
6


The
bill
also
provides
additional
means
of
allowing
a
7


permanent
adoption
record
to
be
open
to
an
adopted
person
who
8


is
an
adult.
9


Current
law
provides
that
the
court
shall,
for
good
cause,
10


order
the
opening
of
the
permanent
adoption
record
for
an
11


adopted
person
who
is
an
adult
and
reveal
the
names
of
either
12


or
both
of
the
biological
parents
following
consideration
of
13


the
affidavit
of
a
biological
parent
requesting
that
the
court
14


reveal
or
not
reveal
the
parent’s
identity
and
consideration
of
15


the
fact
that
the
adopted
person
who
files
the
application
has
16


a
sibling
who
is
a
minor
and
who
has
been
adopted
by
the
same
17


parents.
Under
the
bill,
the
court
would
no
longer
require
18


good
cause
based
upon
these
considerations,
but
instead,
upon
19


the
filing
of
an
affidavit
by
the
adopted
person
who
is
an
20


adult,
the
court
would
open
the
permanent
adoption
records
21


for
the
adopted
person.
The
bill
also
amends
the
provisions
22


relating
to
the
court
opening
termination
or
adoption
records
23


if
the
opening
is
shown
to
be
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
24


or
prevent
irreparable
physical
or
mental
harm
to
an
adopted
25


person
or
the
person’s
offspring.
Current
law
requires
the
26


court
to
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
prevent
the
identity
27


of
the
biological
parents
from
becoming
revealed
to
the
adopted
28


person
when
such
opening
of
the
record
is
allowed.
The
bill
29


would
only
require
the
court
to
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
30


prevent
the
identity
of
the
biological
parents
from
becoming
31


revealed
to
the
adopted
person
when
the
adopted
person
is
a
32


minor,
but
not
when
the
adopted
person
is
an
adult.
33


Current
law
also
includes
a
mutual
consent
provision
under
34


which
a
permanent
adoption
record
may
be
opened
and
reveal
35

H.F.
137


the
names
of
either
or
both
of
the
biological
parents
if
1


a
biological
parent
places
in
the
adoption
record
written
2


consent
to
revelation
of
the
biological
parent’s
identity
3


to
the
adopted
child
at
an
age
specified
by
the
biological
4


parent
upon
request
of
the
adopted
child,
and
the
adult
5


adopted
child
in
turn
has
placed
in
the
adoption
record
6


written
consent
to
revelation
of
the
identity
of
the
adult
7


adopted
child
to
a
biological
parent.
The
bill
retains
the
8


mutual
consent
opportunity
but
provides
that
the
requirements
9


of
the
mutual
consent
process
to
request
the
opening
of
the
10


permanent
adoption
records
shall
not
preclude
the
opening
of
11


the
permanent
adoption
record
if
requested
by
an
adopted
person
12


who
is
an
adult.
13


Under
current
law,
an
adopted
person
whose
adoption
became
14


final
prior
to
July
4,
1941,
and
whose
adoption
record
was
15


not
required
to
be
sealed
at
the
time
when
the
adoption
16


record
was
completed,
is
not
required
to
show
good
cause
for
17


an
order
opening
the
adoption
record.
The
bill
amends
this
18


provision
to
be
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
bill
so
19


that
the
requirement
for
showing
good
cause
is
stricken,
and
20


additionally
the
person
is
not
required
as
other
adults
under
21


the
bill
to
file
an
affidavit
to
request
an
order
to
open
the
22


adoption
record.
