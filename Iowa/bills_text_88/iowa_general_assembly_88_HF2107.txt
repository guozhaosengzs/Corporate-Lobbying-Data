certifications
to
be
issued
by
the
economic

authority
and
the
fiberoptic
conduit
installation
program.
2


The
bill
requires
the
authority
to
establish
a
broadband
3


forward
certification
program.
The
objective
of
the
program
4


is
to
encourage
political
subdivisions
to
further
development
5


of
both
broadband
infrastructure
and
access
to
broadband.
A
6


political
subdivision
shall
apply
to
the
economic
development
7


authority
for
broadband
forward
certification
pursuant
to
8


application
requirements
specified
in
the
bill.
The
bill
9


describes
certain
actions
a
political
subdivision
certified
10


as
broadband
forward
cannot
take.
If
a
political
subdivision
11


successfully
applies
for
broadband
forward
certification,
the
12


authority
is
required
to
coordinate
with
other
state
agencies
13


regarding

the
awarding
of
grants
or
making
14


of
loans.
15


The
bill
also
requires
the
authority
to
establish
a
16


telecommuter
forward

program.
The
objective
of
17


the
program
is
to
encourage
political
subdivisions
to
further
18


and
promote
the
availability
of
telecommuting.
The
bill
19


specifies
application
requirements
for
telecommuter
forward
20


certification,
and
describes
certain
actions
a
political
21


subdivision
certified
as
telecommuter
forward
cannot
take.
22


As
with
the
broadband
forward
certification
program,
if
a
23


political
subdivision
successfully
applies
for
telecommuter
24


forward
certification,
the
authority
is
required
to
coordinate
25


with
other
state
agencies
regarding
preferences
given
in
the
26


awarding
of
grants
or
making
of
loans.
27


The
bill
repeals
the
fiberoptic
network
conduit
installation
28


program
under
the
authority
of
the

of
the
chief
29


information
officer
and
reestablishes
the
program
under
the
30


purview
of
the
department
of
transportation.
The
fiberoptic
31


network
conduit
installation
program
provides
that
the
32


department
of
transportation
is
to
administer
a
program
related
33


to
the
installation
of
fiberoptic
network
conduit
where
such
34


conduit
does
not
exist.

certain
projects.
The
