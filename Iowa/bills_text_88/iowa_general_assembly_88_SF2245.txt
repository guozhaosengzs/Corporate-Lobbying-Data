bill
also
32


prohibits

In

context
of
a
tenant
leasing
a
mobile
3


home
space,
“dwelling
unit”
excludes
the
real
property
used
4


to

home.
The
bill

not

The
bill
provides
that
the
mere

11


or

12


not
constitute
a
clear
and
present
danger.
13


A
provision
in
a
rental
agreement
that
violates
the
bill
is
14


unenforceable.

a
dwelling
unit
may
recover

sustained
by
the
