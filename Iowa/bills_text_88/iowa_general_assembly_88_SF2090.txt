EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


Current
law
requires
a
bicycle
to
have
a
front
lighted
lamp
14


and
either
a
rear
lighted
lamp
or
a
rear
reflector
at
any
time
15


from
sunset
to
sunrise,
and
at
such
other
times
when
conditions
16


such
as
fog,
snow,
sleet,
or
rain
provide
insufficient
lighting
17


to
render
clearly
discernible
persons
and
vehicles
on
the
18


highway
at
a
distance
of
500
feet
ahead.
19


This
bill
requires
every
bicycle
to
have
a
front
and
rear
20


lighted
lamp
during
the
stated
periods
of
time,
and
strikes
the
21


provision
allowing
a
bicycle
to
be
equipped
a
rear
reflector
22


in
lieu
of
the
rear
lighted
lamp.
The
scheduled
fine
for
23


violating
this
provision
is
$25.
However,
the
bill
provides
24


that
a
citation
issued
for
failure
to
have
a
front
lamp
or
25


rear
lamp
on
a
bicycle
must
first
provide
for
a
72-hour
period
26


within
which
the
person
charged
with
the
violation
shall
27


replace
or
repair
the
lamp.
If
the
person
complies
with
the
28


directive
to
replace
or
repair
the
lamp,
the
citation
must
be
29


expunged.
30


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2021.
