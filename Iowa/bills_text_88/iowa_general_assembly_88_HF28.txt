the

rate
determinations
19


that

27


costing
more

In
determining

the

the

15
days

posted
the

on
its

to
object
in

to,
and
either
affirm
or
modify
it
within
15

of
receiving
19


the

20


If
the
commissioner
declines
to
modify
the
determination,
21


within
10
days,
the
person
affected
may
submit
an
objection
in

All
7


bids
shall
list
the
specific
wage
rates
for
each
craft,
8


classification,
and
type
of
worker
needed
for
the
public
9


improvement.
All
contractors
and
subcontractors
are
required
10


to
sign
a
contract
that
states
they
will
pay
workers
the
wage
11


rate
determined
by
the
division.
If
the
contractors
and
12


subcontractors
are
found
to
not
be
paying
the
wage
rate,
the
13


contract
states
that
the
contractor’s
or
subcontractor’s
right
14


to
work
on
the
public
improvement
and
get
paid
for
work
already
15


done
may
be
terminated.
16


Before
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
receives
the
final
17


payment
for
the
public
improvement,
the
public
body
overseeing
18


the
public
improvement
must
certify
the
payments
include
proper
19


amounts
due
the
workers,
and
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
20


must
swear
under
oath
that
the
records
are
accurate.
21


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
public
improvement
projects
22


funded
by
the
federal
government
that
require
federal
23


prevailing
wage
rates.
However,
unless
a
federal
provision
24


applies,
if
a
public
improvement
project
is
financed
by
both
a
25


state
public
body
and
the
federal
government,
then
the
higher
26


of
the
applicable
wage
rates
shall
be
paid
to
the
workers.
27


The
bill
also
requires
that
contractors
and
subcontractors
28


keep
detailed
records
for
at
least
three
years
about
the
29


workers,
the
rates
paid,
and
the
hours
worked
for
each
30


public
improvement.
The
records
are
public
records
and
must
31


be
available
for
inspection.
However,
workers’
personal
32


information
is
not
available
to
the
public
for
inspection.
33


During
the
public
improvement,
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
34


must
present
a
certified
weekly
payroll
to
demonstrate
that
35

H.F.
28


the
correct
and
full
wage
rate
is
being
paid
to
workers.
The
1


contractors
and
subcontractors
must
make
all
workers
available
2


on-site
to
officials
for
interviews
so
that
the
records’
3


accuracy
can
be
checked.
Contractors
and
subcontractors
must
4


also
post
the
wage
rates
for
each
craft,
classification,
and
5


type
of
worker
in
a
public
place
where
workers
can
see
the
6


posting
or
at
the
place
where
they
receive
their
wages.
7


The
commissioner
is
given
specific
powers
for
investigation,
8


enforcement,
and
penalization.
The
commissioner
may
sue
to
9


prevent
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
from
being
awarded
10


a
contract
for
a
public
improvement
when
the
wage
rate
11


requirements
have
not
been
met.
The
commissioner
is
given
the
12


power
to
withhold
payments
if
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
13


does
not
produce
records
upon
request
and
to
pay
the
workers
14


directly
if
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
continues
to
refuse
15


to
provide
records.
16


After
receiving
a
complaint,
the
commissioner
shall
17


investigate
whether
there
has
been
a
violation.
If
the
18


commissioner
determines
there
has
been
a
violation,
the
19


contractor
or
subcontractor
must
be
given
notice
of
that
20


violation.
The
notice
is
a
formal
written
statement
from
the
21


department
of
workforce
development
that
states
the
specific
22


violation
and
the
amount
of
money
due
as
a
penalty.
23


If
a
public
body
has
divided
up
a
public
improvement
to
24


avoid
having
to
pay
the
wage
rate,
the
commissioner
shall
order
25


compliance.
A
worker
who
is
paid
less
than
the
wage
rate
set
by
26


this
law
can
sue
for
the
difference
in
payment
and
collect
the
27


difference
along
with
costs
and
attorney
fees
in
court.
28


The
contractor
or
subcontractor
shall
also
have
to
pay
the
29


division
50
percent
of
the
amount
of
underpayment
and
is
liable
30


to
the
worker
for
punitive
damages
of
up
to
5
percent
of
the
31


underpayments
for
each
month
the
underpayment
remains
unpaid
32


plus
costs
and
attorney
fees.
33


If
a
second
or
subsequent
action
for
underpaying
a
worker
34


is
brought
against
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
within
a

three-year
period
and
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
is
1


liable,
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
shall
pay
the
division
2


75
percent
of
the
amount
of
underpayment,
is
liable
to
the
3


worker
for
10
percent
of
the
penalty
for
underpayments
for
each
4


month
following
it
that
the
underpayment
remains
unpaid,
and
5


is
liable
to
the
worker
for
triple
the
difference
between
the
6


amount
paid
to
the
worker
and
the
amount
due
under
the
wage
7


rate
set
by
the
commissioner
plus
costs
and
attorney
fees.
8


The
commissioner
or
any
interested
party
has
a
right
of
9


action
on
behalf
of
any
individual
who
has
a
right
of
action
10


under
the
bill.
The
commissioner
may
file
a
lawsuit
in
trust
11


for
a
worker
who
assigns
the
claim
and
then
bring
legal
action
12


to
collect
the
claim.
The
contractor
shall
be
required
to
pay
13


the
expenses
for
collection
of
the
claim.
14


The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
requesting
or
demanding
15


that
a
worker
pay
back,
return,
donate,
contribute,
or
give
16


any
part
or
all
of
the
worker’s
wages,
salary,
or
thing
of
17


value,
to
any
person
who
asserts
that
failure
to
comply
with
18


the
request
or
demand
will
prevent
the
worker
from
procuring
19


or
retaining
employment.
The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
20


paying,
requesting,
or
authorizing
any
other
person
to
violate
21


the
requirements
of
the
bill.
However,
these
provisions
do
22


not
apply
to
authorized
labor
organization
representatives
23


collecting
dues
or
assessments.
24


In
addition
to
other
penalties
under
the
bill,
anyone
who
25


attempts
to
get
a
worker
to
give
up
any
part
of
compensation
26


on
a
public
improvement
by
threat
not
to
hire
or
by
threat
of
27


firing
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor.
Any
agreement
to
28


work
for
less
than
the
determined
wage
rate
is
not
a
defense
to
29


criminal
prosecution.
A
serious
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
30


confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
of
at
least
31


$315
but
not
more
than
$1,875.
32


If
a
contractor
or
subcontractor
has
violated
the
bill
twice


33


within
a
three-year
period,
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
34


or
any
company
or
group
associated
with
the
contractor

subcontractor
shall
not
be
given
any
public
improvement
work
1


for
five
years.
The
department
of
workforce
development
2


shall
keep
a
list
on
its
internet
site
of
contractors
and
3


subcontractors
who
have
violated
the
bill
twice
within
a
4


three-year
period
and
notify
public
bodies
by
restricted
5


certified
mail.
6


A
contractor
or
subcontractor
who
has
been
notified
of
7


the
second
violation
has
10
days
to
request
a
hearing
before
8


an
administrative
law
judge.
A
hearing
must
be
held
within
9


45
days
of
the
request.
If
no
hearing
is
requested,
the
10


contractor
is
barred
from
receiving
public
improvement
work
and
11


its
name
and
information
is
posted
on
the
department’s
internet
12


site.
13


Apprentices
employed
on
a
public
improvement
project
must
14


be
registered
with
the
federal
office
of
apprenticeship.
15


Apprentices
must
receive
the
wages
set
out
in
the
standards
of
16


apprenticeship
and
do
only
the
work
specified
in
the
trade
to
17


which
they
are
apprenticed.
An
apprentice
not
registered
with
18


the
federal
program
shall
be
paid
the
wage
rate
the
same
as
any
19


other
worker.
20


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
21


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
22


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
23


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
24


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
25


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
26


mandate
included
in
the
bill.


27


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2020.
