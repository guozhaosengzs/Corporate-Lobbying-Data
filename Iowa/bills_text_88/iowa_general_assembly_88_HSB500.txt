perfected
in
two
ways.
First,
the
lien
is
automatically
17


perfected
at
the
time
the
licensed
grain
warehouse
takes
18


possession
of
the
grain.
During
the
period
of
possession,
19


the
lien
enjoys
a
super-priority
status
over
any
competing
20


creditor’s
interest.
Thus,
a
licensed
warehouse
could
enforce
21


the
lien
before
all
other
competing
security
interests
and
22


statutory
liens,
including
agricultural
liens,
and
common
law
23


liens
regardless
of
when
the
competing
security
interest
or
24


lien
was
perfected.
The
automatic
perfection
terminates
when
25


the
licensed
grain
dealer
relinquishes
possession
of
the
grain.
26


However,
the
licensed
warehouse
may
retain
its
super-priority
27


status
by
filing
a
financing
statement
(UCC-1)
with
the
28


secretary
of
state
during
the
period
that
the
possessory
lien
29


is
perfected.
If
the
financing
statement
is
filed
after
30


the
period
that
the
grain
warehouse
lien
is
automatically
31


perfected,
or
the
lien
is
never
perfected
after
that
period,
32


the
lien
has
priority
over
a
conflicting
security
interest,
33


agricultural
lien,
or
other
lien
in
the
grain
in
the
same
34


manner
as
provided
for
other
agricultural
liens
as
if
the
lien

1


BACKGROUND.
Under
Iowa’s
version
of
the
UCC,
article
9,
2


a
security
interest
is
created
by
a
contract
referred
to
as
3


a
security
agreement
executed
by
a
creditor
and
debtor
that
4


creates
a
financial
obligation
(Code
section
554.9201).
The
5


security
interest
attaches
to
the
debtor’s
collateral
(Code
6


section
554.9203)
and
based
on
that
agreement
the
creditor
7


may
perfect
the
security
interest
by
filing
a
financing
8


statement
with
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
554.9310).
9


Possession
is
also
a
means
to
perfect
a
security
interest,
10


including
general
warehouse
lien
allowed
under
the
UCC,
11


article
7
(Code
section
554.7209).
In
addition,
various
Code
12


chapters
existing
outside
the
UCC
create
agricultural
liens
in
13


commodities
produced
by
a
farming
operation.
An
agricultural
14


lien
is
a
statutory
lien
that
may
secure
the
payment
of
a
15


financial
obligation
associated
with
commodity
production,
and
16


is
not
necessarily
possessory,
meaning
that
it
may
continue
to
17


cover
the
commodity
after
harvest
and
delivery
(Code
section
18


554.9102(1)(e)).
However,
an
agricultural
lien
must
be
19


perfected
by
filing
a
financing
statement
with
the
secretary
20


of
state
(Code
section
554.9310).
Once
a
lien
is
created,
it
21


receives
a
degree
of
priority
over
the
covered
collateral
among
22


competing
creditors
seeking
to
enforce
a
debt.
Generally,
23


under
the
UCC,
article
9,
the
status
of
a
creditor’s
priority
24


is
based
on
the
date
of
the
security
interest’s
perfection.
25


However,
certain
statutes
outside
the
UCC,
article
9,
provide
26


a
special
status
to
lienholders,
including
those
holding
27


agricultural
liens.
28


APPLICABILITY.
The
bill
applies
to
grain
first
delivered
by
29


a
grain
depositor
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
this
Act.
