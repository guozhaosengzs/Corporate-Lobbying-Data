EXPLANATION
6


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
7


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
8


This
bill
relates
to
the
use
of
gasification
and
pyrolysis
9


facilities
for
the
conversion
of
certain
recoverable
waste
10


materials.
11


The
bill
creates
definitions
for
the
processes
of
12


gasification
and
pyrolysis,
the
facilities
where
those
13


processes
take
place
(“gasification
facility”
and
“pyrolysis
14


facility”),
and
the
materials
used
in
those
processes
15


(“post-use
polymer”
and
“recoverable
feedstock”).
The
16


bill
excludes
pyrolysis
and
gasification
facilities
from
17


the
definition
of
“sanitary
disposal
project”,
certain
18


post-use
polymers
and
recoverable
feedstocks
from
the
19


definition
of
“solid
waste”,
and
certain
gasification
and
20


pyrolysis
facilities
from
the
definition
of
“waste
conversion
21


technologies”.
As
such,
certain
post-use
polymers
and
22


recoverable
feedstocks
and
certain
gasification
and
pyrolysis
23


facilities
are
not
subject
to
solid
waste
procedures
and
24


requirements
set
forth
in
Code
chapter
455B.
25


The
bill
also
provides
that
preprocessed
and
postprocessed
26


post-use
polymers
and
recoverable
feedstocks
are
the
sole
27


property
of
the
pyrolysis
or
gasification
facility
at
which
28


those
materials
are
stored.
Under
the
bill,
those
materials
29


shall
be
sold
or
lawfully
disposed
of
within
60
days
of
the
30


termination
of
operations
of
a
pyrolysis
or
gasification
31


facility.
