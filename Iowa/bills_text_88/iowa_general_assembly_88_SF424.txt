EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the

assembly.
13


BACKGROUND.
Guardians
are
persons
and
entities
appointed
by
14


the
court
to
make
decisions
for
persons
regarding
the
person’s
15


care,
maintenance,
health,
education,
welfare,
and
safety.
16


Conservators
are
appointed
by
the
court
to
make
decisions
for
17


persons
regarding
management
of
their
financial
affairs.
18


This
bill
amends
the
Iowa
probate
code,
which
provides
19


for
the
opening
and
administration
of
guardianships
and
20


conservatorships
for
adults
and
minors.
The
bill
amends
21


the
provisions
governing
guardianships
for
adults
and
22


conservatorships
for
adults
and
minors.
The
bill
deletes
23


provisions
relating
to
guardianships
for
minors.
The
bill
does
24


not
provide
a
process
for
a
court
to
appoint
a
guardian
for
a
25


minor.
26


TERMINOLOGY.
The
current
Code
uses
the
term
“proposed
ward”
27


to
refer
to
persons
alleged
to
be
in
need
of
a
guardianship
or
28


conservatorship,
and
the
term
“ward”
to
refer
to
a
person
for
29


whom
the
court
has
appointed
a
guardian
or
conservator.
The
30


bill
substitutes
the
term
“respondent”
for
the
term
“proposed
31


ward”.
The
bill
substitutes
the
term
“protected
person”
for
32

of
a
guardian
for
an
adult.
The
court
must
find
by
clear
1


and
convincing
evidence
that
the

has
diminished
2


decision-making
capacity
resulting
in
the
adult’s
inability
to
3


care
for
or
protect
the
adult.

the

The
court
must
find

adult
has
diminished
decision-making
capacity
7


resulting
in
the
adult’s
inability
to
manage
the
adult’s
8


financial
affairs.
The
current
Code
does
not
set
forth
the
9


substantive
criteria
that
must
be
met
for
the
appointment
of
a
10


conservator
for
a
minor.
The
bill
requires
that
the
court
find
11


by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
a
conservator
is
needed
to
12


manage
or
protect
the
minor’s
funds
or
other
assets.

PETITION,
NOTICE,
AND

and
hearing.
The
bill
16


states
that
the
petition
must
contain
a
concise
statement
of
17


the
factual
basis
for
the
petition
and
a
concise
statement
of
18


why
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative
to
the
appointment
19


of
a
guardian
or
conservator.
The
bill
also
designates
persons
20


with
an
actual
or
potential
interest
in
a
guardianship
or
21


conservatorship
proceeding
who
must
be
listed,
if
known,
in
the
22


petition.
23


ATTORNEY
FOR
RESPONDENT.
The
bill
retains
the
current
24


Code
provision
under
which
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
be
25


represented
by
a
court-appointed
attorney
if
indigent
or
26


incapable
of
requesting
an
attorney.
The
bill
also
retains
the
27


current
Code
provision
describing
the
responsibilities
of
the
28


attorney
representing
the
respondent.
29


GUARDIAN
AD
LITEM
——
COURT
VISITOR.
The
bill
clarifies
the


30

of
the

31


for
the
respondent
and
the
guardian
ad
litem.
In

32


the
bill
substitutes
the

33


“guardian
ad
litem”.
The
bill
provides
that
a
court
may,
but

also

PROFESSIONAL
EVALUATIONS.
The

5


authorizes

proceedings
for

confidential
with

BACKGROUND
CHECKS
OF
PROPOSED
GUARDIANS
AND
CONSERVATORS.
16


The
current
Code
does
not
require
background
checks
of
17


proposed
guardians
or
conservators.
The
bill
mandates
that
18


proposed
guardians
and
conservators,
other

financial
19


institutions,
undergo
Iowa
criminal
