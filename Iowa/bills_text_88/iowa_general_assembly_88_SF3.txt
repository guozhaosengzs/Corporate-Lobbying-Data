25


having
cause
to
believe
that
the
animal
is
a
threatened
animal
26


after
consulting

.
An

cruelty
report

A

enforcement
officer
may
rescue
an
animal
from
a
6


stationary
motor
vehicle,
including
through
the
use
of
forced
7


entrance,
if
the

officer
reasonably

that
the
animal
may
be
suffering
distress
due
to
exposure
to
9


extreme
interior
temperature
or
a
lack
of
adequate
ventilation.
10


The
law
enforcement
officer’s
action
is
justified
regardless
11


of
whether
the
law
enforcement
officer
observed
indications
12


of
distress
or
whether
the
person
could
be
charged
with
or
13


convicted
of
committing
a
public
offense.

2.
The
law
enforcement
officer
shall
provide
written
15


notice
of
the
rescue
to
the
animal’s
responsible
party.
This
16


requirement
is
satisfied
by
placing
the
notice
in
a
conspicuous
17


place
located
within
the
motor
vehicle.
The
notice
must
state
18


where
the

However,
a
dispositional
proceeding
under

is
not
required
if
within
ten
days
after
the
23


date
of
the
animal’s
rescue
the

party
claims
the

animal
from
the

In

of
a

23


the

current
Code
section
prohibiting
8


animal
abuse
that
excepts
from
culpability
the
animal’s
owner
9


or
a
person
acting
with
the
owner’s
consent.
The
bill
also

depraved
intent.
