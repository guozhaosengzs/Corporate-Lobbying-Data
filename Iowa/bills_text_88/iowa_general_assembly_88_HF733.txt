OVERVIEW.
This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
under
Title
13


V,
subtitle
4,
of
the
Code
regulating
persons
operating
under
14


licenses
issued
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
15


stewardship
(DALS).
The
bill
creates
Code
chapter
204
and
16


authorizes
the
production
of
hemp
under
the
DALS’
regulatory
17


supervision
when
acting
under
the
provisions
of
the
Agriculture
18


Improvement
Act
of
2018,
Pub.
L.
No.
115-334
(2018
Farm
Bill).
19


The
2018
Farm
Bill
defines
hemp
as
a
species
of
Cannabis
having
20


a
maximum
concentration
of
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
21


that
does
not
exceed
three-tenths
of
1
percent.
The
2018
Farm
22


Bill
authorizes
states
to
assume
primary
regulatory
authority
23


over
the
production
of
hemp
by
submitting
a
state
plan
(plan)
24


for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
25


(USDA)
which
has
60
days
to
approve,
disapprove,
or
amend
the
26


plan.
The
2018
Farm
Bill
provides
that
state
regulations
may
27


be
more
but
not
less
stringent
than
the

or
disapprove
applications
for
the
issuance
of
a

a
one-year
basis
subject

A

issued
to
the

issuance
of
a

an
annual
fall

After
that
date,
fees
are
to
be
established
by
9


rule
based
on
the
amount
required
to
administer
and
enforce
the
10

14


CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCE
——
REGULATIONS
——
HEMP.
Marijuana
15


produced
on
a
licensee’s
crop
site
is
not
a
controlled
16


substance,
so
long
as
certain
conditions
are
satisfied.
17


Generally,
production,
possession,
or
distribution
of
a
18


controlled
substance
is
a
criminal
offense.
The
bill
provides
19


that
new
Code
chapter
204
does
not
prohibit
a
person
from
20


producing,
handling,
transporting,
marketing,
or
processing
a
21


hemp
product.
Both
DALS
and
DPS
are
required
to
adopt
rules
22


regulating
licensees
and
are
authorized
to
inspect
crop
sites.
23


DPS
may
require
a
licensee
to
maintain
business
records
which
24


are
also
subject
to
inspection.
DPS
is
required
to
conduct
25


an
annual
inspection
of
a
licensee’s
crop
site
and
obtain
a
26


sample
for
official
testing
by
a
laboratory
designated
by
DPS.
27


A
test
result
that
indicates
a
sample
exceeds
the
maximum
28


concentration
of
THC
is
deemed
conclusive
that
the
crop
is
a
29


controlled
substance.
30


ENFORCEMENT
AND
PENALTIES.
DPS,
in
cooperation
with
DALS,
31


may
order
the
disposal
of
a
crop
produced
on
a
licensee’s
32


crop
site
if
official
test
results
indicate
that
a
crop
is
33


a
controlled
substance.
The
disposal,
including
the
crop’s
34


destruction,
must
be
at
the
licensee’s
expense.
DALS
may
