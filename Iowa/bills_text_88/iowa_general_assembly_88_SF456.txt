services
of

The
bill
requires
in
new
Code
section
91C.6B
that
a
1


contractor,
prior
to
entering
into
a
home
improvement
contract
2


in
Iowa,
obtain
a
surety
bond
of
$75,000.
The
new
bond
is
in
3


addition
to
any
other
bond
requirements
in
Code
chapter
91C.
4


The
bond
benefits
a
person
who
is
damaged
by
the
contractor’s
5


breach
of
contract
or
by
the
contractor’s
breach
of
Code
6


section
714.16,
the
consumer
fraud
statute,
regardless
of
7


whether
the
person
has
a
direct
cause
of
action
under
that
Code
8


section.
Any
person
damaged
in
either
way
may
sue
directly
9


on
the
bond
and
may
recover
actual
damages,
court
costs,
and
10


reasonable
attorney
fees.
The
bill
defines
“home
improvement
11


contract”
to
mean
any
contract
for
the
improvement
or
repair
12


of
existing
residential
property
and
the
appurtenances
of
such
13


property,
as
specified
in
the
bill,
but
not
including
contracts
14


of
less
than
$200
in
total.
15


The
bill
provides
that
when
a
suit
is
filed,
the
person
who
16


sues
on
the
bond
shall
notify
the
division
of
labor
services,
17


which
shall
maintain
a
public
record
of
all
suits
commenced.
18


Notification
is
not
a
precondition
to
filing
a
suit
and
19


failure
to
notify
the
division
does
not
in
any
way
invalidate
a
20


lawsuit.
However,
bond
proceeds
cannot
be
paid
out
to
anyone
21


who
has
not
filed
notification.
22


The
bill
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may
also
make
23


a
direct
claim
on
a
bond
or
bring
an
action
in
equity
against
24


the
bond
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
recover
bond
proceeds
for
25


persons
damaged
due
to
a
contractor’s
breach
of
contract
or
26


violation
of
the
consumer
fraud
statute
in
connection
with
a


27


home
improvement
contract.
The
attorney
general’s
action
shall
28


take
precedence
over
all
other
claims
on
the
bond
regardless
29


of
the
time
of
filing.
30


The
bill
requires
the
issuer
of
a
bond
to
notify
the
labor
31


commissioner
upon
the
cancellation
of
the
bond.
If
a
bond
is
32


canceled
or
otherwise
ceases
to
be
in
effect,
the
contractor’s
33


registration
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
91C
shall
be
void.
The
34


failure
of
a
contractor

contract
or

of

contractor’s

or

The
bill
provides
that
a
contractor
who
violates
any
7


provision
of
new
Code
section
91C.6B
is
guilty
of
a
simple
8

30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
10


not
more
than
$625
or
by

The
bill
further
provides
11


that
a
violation
of
new
Code
section
91C.6B
is
an
unlawful
12


practice
pursuant
to
Code
section
714.16,
which
allows
the
13


attorney
general
to
investigate,
issue
subpoenas,
and
commence
14


civil
proceedings
seeking
restraining
orders
or
injunctions
15


prohibiting

16


or

affairs
of
a
