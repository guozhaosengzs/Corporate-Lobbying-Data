S.F.
_____


a
substantial
or
permanent
loss
or
impairment
of
a
bodily
1


function,
substantial
disfigurement,
or
death,
which
warrants
2


a
finding
that
imposition
of
such
a
limitation
would
deprive
3


the
plaintiff
of
just
compensation
for
the
injuries
sustained.
4


Current
law
also
provides
that
the
limitation
on
damages
5


shall
not
apply
as
to
a
defendant
if
the
defendant’s
actions
6


constituted
actual
malice.
7


The
bill
eliminates
the
exception
to
the
limitation
8


of
$250,000
that
would
allow
the
jury
to
determine
if
the
9


imposition
of
such
a
limitation
would
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
10


just
compensation
for
the
injuries
sustained.
11


Under
the
bill,
“noneconomic
damages”
means
damages
arising
12


from
pain,
suffering,
inconvenience,
physical
impairment,
13


mental
anguish,
emotional
pain
and
suffering,
loss
of
chance,
14


loss
of
consortium,
or
any
other
nonpecuniary
damages.
15


The
bill
also
provides
that
evidence
offered
to
prove
past
16


medical
expenses
shall
be
limited
to
evidence
of
the
amounts
17


that
were
actually
paid
to
satisfy
bills
that
have
been
18


satisfied
and
evidence
of
the
amounts
necessary
to
satisfy
19


the
bills
that
have
not
yet
been
satisfied.
The
bill
does
20


not
impose
an
affirmative
duty
to
seek
a
reduction
in
billed
21


charges
to
which
the
party
is
not
contractually
entitled.
