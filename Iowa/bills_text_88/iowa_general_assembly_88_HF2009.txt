1.
Be
based
on
the
services
provided
as
indicated

presenting
symptoms

not
on

medical
condition
means
6


a
medical
condition
manifesting
itself

so
that
a
prudent
8


layperson,
who
possesses
an
average
knowledge
of
health
and
9


medicine,
could
reasonably
expect
the
absence
of
immediate
10


medical
attention
to
result
in
placing
the
health
of
an
11


individual
(or,
with
respect
to
a
pregnant
woman,
the
health
12


of
the
woman
or
her
unborn
child)
in
serious
jeopardy;
serious
13


impairment
to
bodily
functions;
or
serious
dysfunction
of
any
14


bodily
organ
or
part.
15


3.
Shall
not
be
denied
including
retroactively
denied,
16


restricted,
reduced,
or
down-coded
based
on
a
“policy
of
17


selective
emergency
services
coverage”
which
means
any
practice
18


of
making
reimbursement
for
emergency
services
dependent
upon
19


a
determination
of
whether
an
injury,
symptom,
complaint,
or
20


other
presenting
condition
strictly
constitutes
an
emergency
21


medical
condition.
22


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
human
services
to
23


adopt
administrative
rules
and
provides
that
any
contract
the
24


department
enters
into
with
a
managed
care
organization
shall
25


require
the
managed
care
organization
to
comply
with
the
bill
26


and
the
rules
adopted
under
the
bill.
