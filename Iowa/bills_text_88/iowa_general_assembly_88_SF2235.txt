The

9


abilities,
and
may
include
difficulties
that

result
10


from
a
deficit
in
the
phonological
component
of
language
that
11


is
often
unexpected
in
relation
to
other
cognitive
abilities
12


and
the
provision
of

classroom
instruction,
as
13


well
as
secondary
consequences
such
as
problems
in

14


comprehension
and
