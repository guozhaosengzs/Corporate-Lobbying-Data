when

A

terminates
upon



the
issuance
of
an

Sec.
13.
Section
204.8,
subsection
3,
Code
2020,
is
amended



by
striking
the
subsection
and
inserting
in
lieu
thereof
the



following:



3.
The
official
test
shall
be
a
composite
test
of
the



plants
obtained
by
the
department
from
a
licensee’s
crop



site
during
the
annual
inspection
and
shall
be
conducted
by



a
laboratory
designated
by
the
department.
The
sample
must



have
an
acceptable
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration,



resulting
from
a
post
decarboxylation
analysis,
that
does
not



exceed
three-tenths
of
one
percent
on
a
dry
weight
basis.



a.
The
laboratory
shall
report
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol



concentration
on
a
dry
weight
basis
that
accounts
for
a



measurement
uncertainty
associated
with
the
result
of
a



measurement.
The
measurement
uncertainty
shall
characterize



the
dispersion
of
the
values
that
could
be
reasonably



attributed
to
the
particular
quantity
subject
to
measurement.



The
acceptable
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration



occurs
when
the
application
of
the
measurement
uncertainty
to



the
reported
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration
on
a



dry
weight
basis
produces
a
distribution
or
range
that
includes



three-tenths
of
one
percent
or
less.



b.
The
post
decarboxylation
value
is
the
result



of
an
analysis
determined
after
the
process
of



decarboxylation
that
determines
the
total
potential



delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
content
derived
from
the
sum
of



the
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
concentration
and
delta-9



tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid
content
and
reported
on
a
dry



weight
basis.
The
post
decarboxylation
value
may
be
determined



by
using
a
chromatographic
technique
using
heat
and
gas



chromatography,
through
which
the
tetrahydrocannabinolic



acid
content
is
converted
from
its
acid
form
to
its
neutral





form.
The
post
decarboxylation
value
may
also
be
calculated



by
using
a
high-performance
liquid
chromatograph
technique,



which
keeps
the
tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid
intact
and
requires









House
File

p.

a
conversion
calculation
of
that
tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid



to
determine
the
total
potential
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol



content
in
a
given
sample.
