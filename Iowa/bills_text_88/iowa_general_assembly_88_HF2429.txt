EXPLANATION
10


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
relates
to
the
awarding
of
custody
of
a
child.
13


The
bill
amends
the
factors
upon
which
the
court
determines
14


the
custody
arrangement
that
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
15


child
by
eliminating
the
factor
of
whether
one
or
both
of
the
16


parents
agree
or
are
opposed
to
joint
custody.
17


The
bill
establishes
a
rebuttable
presumption
in
favor
of
18


the
awarding
of
joint
physical
care
if
the
court
awards
joint
19


legal
custody
to
both
parents,
and
requires
the
parents
to
20


submit
a
joint
physical
care
parenting
plan.
If
the
court
does
21


not
award
joint
physical
care,
the
bill
requires
the
court
to
22


cite
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
awarding
of
joint
23


physical
care
is
unreasonable
and
not
in
the
best
interest
24


of
the
child,
to
the
extent
that
the
joint
physical
care
25


relationship
between
the
child
and
each
parent
should
not
be
26


equal.
A
finding
by
the
court
that
a
history
of
child
abuse
or
27


neglect
exists
relative
to
the
child
is
sufficient
to
rebut
the
28


presumption
in
favor
of
the
awarding
of
joint
physical
care.
29


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes
in
the
Code
due
to
the
30


elimination
of
the
factor
of
whether
one
or
both
of
the
parents
31


agree
or
are
opposed
to
joint
custody
relative
to
determining
32


the
best
interest
of
the
child.
