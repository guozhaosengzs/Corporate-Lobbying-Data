EXPLANATION
14


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
15


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
16


Under
current
law,
the
state
board
of
regents
is
not
included
17


in
the
definition
of
“governmental
entity”
for
purposes
of
18


Code
chapter
26,
which
governs
public
construction
bidding
19


procedures.
Additionally,
current
law
gives
governmental
20


entities
the
option
of
including
on
a
notice
to
bidders
whether
21


the
proposed
bid
will
be
for
the
furnishing
of
all
labor
and
22


materials
and
furnishing
or
installing
equipment
under
one
23


contract
or
for
parts
thereof

This
bill
eliminates
the
exclusion
of
the
state
board

The
26


bill
makes
conforming
changes
to
reflect
the
changed
bidding
27


procedures
for
the
state
board
of
regents.
The
bill
also
28


requires
a
notice
to
bidders
to
provide
that
bids
will
be
29


received
for
the
furnishing
of
all
labor
and
materials
and
30


furnishing
or
installing
equipment
under
one
contract.
In
31


addition,
a
governmental
entity
may
also
include
in
the
notice
32


that
bids
will
be
received
for
parts
of
a
project
in
separate
33


sections.
