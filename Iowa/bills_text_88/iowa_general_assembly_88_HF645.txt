EXPLANATION

The

the
explanation’s
substance
by

members

11


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
the
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
12


Act”
codified
in
Code
chapter
490,
by
creating
new
division
13


XVIII
governing
benefit
corporations.
The
bill
allows
a
14


new
business
for-profit
to
either
incorporate
as
a
benefit
15


corporation
or
as
an
existing
corporation
to
become
a
benefit
16


corporation.
The
purpose
of
a
benefit
corporation
is
to
17


operate
in
a
responsible
and
sustainable
manner,
that
promotes
18


one
or
more
public
benefits,
and
in
a
manner
that
considers
19


the
best
interests
of
persons
materially
affected
by
its
20


conduct
(new
Code
section
490.1801(1)).
A
public
benefit
21


may
be
of
an
artistic,
charitable,
cultural,
economic,
22


educational,
cultural,
literary,
religious,
social,
ecological,
23


or
scientific
nature
(new
Code
section
490.1801(2)).
Both
24


existing
Code
chapter
490
and
the
bill’s
amendments
in
part
25


creating
new
division
XVIII
are
based
on
model
legislation
26


prepared
by
the
American
bar
association.
27


DECLARATION.
In
order
to
be
regarded
as
a
benefit
28


corporation,
the
corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
29


(articles)
must
include
a
public
benefit
provision
that
30


expressly
describes
the
corporation’s
public
benefit
(new
31


Code
section
490.1801(3)).
Moreover,
the
corporation’s
32


benefit
status
must
be
identified
in
its
corporate
name
(new
33


Code
section
490.1802
and
amended
Code
section
490.401).
34


Consequently,
a
professional
corporation
which
is
a
benefit
35


-6-


LSB
2211YH
(1)
88


da/rn
6/

H.F.
645


corporation
must
also
identify
itself
as
a
form
of
benefit
1


corporation
(new
Code
section
490.1802
and
amended
Code
section
2


496C.5).
In
addition,
stock
issued
by
the
benefit
corporation
3


must
state
its
benefit
status
(new
Code
section
490.1804),
as
4


must
any
shareholder
meeting
notice
(Code
section
490.1806(1)).
5


CHOICE
TO
FORM
AS
OR
BECOME
A
BENEFIT
ENTITY.
A
new
business
6


may
choose
to
form
as
a
benefit
corporation
at
the
time
of
7


incorporation
by
declaring
so
in
its
articles
of
incorporation
8


filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
(new
Code
section
490.1801(3)
9


and
existing
Code
section
490.202).
An
existing
corporation
10


may
choose
to
become
a
benefit
corporation
by
amending
its
11


filed
articles
(new
Code
section
490.1803(1)
and
existing
12


Code
section
490.1003)).
An
existing
corporation
may
also
13


choose
to
become
a
benefit
corporation
by
combining
through
14


merger
or
share
exchange
with
a
benefit
corporation
or
similar
15


foreign
public
benefit
entity
(new
Code
section
490.1803(1)
16


and
existing
Code
section
490.1104(7)).
In
any
case,
at
17


least
90
percent
of
the
corporation’s
outstanding
voting
and
18


nonvoting
shares
of
each
class
and
series
must
approve
the
19


choice.
Dissenting
shareholders
are
entitled
to
exercise
20


ordinary
appraisal
rights
(amended
Code
section
490.1302(1)).
21


However,
the
approval
of
at
least
two-thirds
(66
2/3
percent)
22


of
a
benefit
corporation’s
outstanding
shares
entitled
to
vote
23


on
the
question
is
required
to
amend
or
eliminate
a
public
24


benefit
provision
from
its
articles,
or

MANAGEMENT.
When
making
a
decision
affecting
the
business
29


affairs
of
a
benefit
corporation,
its
board
of
directors
30


must
balance
three
criteria:
its
public
benefit
provision,
31


the
best
interests
of
persons
materially
affected
by
the
32


benefit
corporation’s
conduct,
and
the
traditional
factor
33


of
its
stockholders’
pecuniary
interests
(new
Code
section
34


490.1805(1)).
A
director
does
not
have
a
duty
to
account
for
a

645


business
decision
that
impacts
a
shareholder
as
a
beneficiary
1


of
a
corporation’s
public
benefit
provision
(new
Code
section
2


490.1805(2)).
A
director’s
failure
to
consider
a
factor
3


does
not
constitute
an
intentional
infliction
of
harm
on
the
4


corporation
or
the
shareholders,
unless
otherwise
provided
in
5


the
corporation’s
articles
(new
Code
section
490.1805(3)).
6


However,
at
least
5
percent
of
the
corporation’s
shareholders
7


in
any
class
may
institute
a
derivative
suit
to
enforce
8


compliance
with
the
corporation’s
public
benefit
provision,
in
9


part
by
alleging
that
the
directors
failed
to
properly
perform
10


their
duties
(new
Code
section
490.1807
and
existing
Code
11


chapter
division
VII,
part
D).
12


REPORT.
A
benefit
corporation
must
prepare
and
deliver
13


a
report
to
shareholders
that
addresses
how
its
public
14


benefit
provision
is
being
promoted
and
persons
materially
15


affected
by
the
benefit
corporation’s
conduct
(new
Code
16


section
490.1806(2)).
The
benefit
corporation’s
directors
17


are
responsible
for
the
report’s
preparation.
The
benefit
18


corporation’s
articles
may
require
the
involvement
by
a
19


third
party,
who
may
be
responsible
for
certifying
how
the
20


corporation
addressed
the
public
benefit
or
the
best
interests
21


of
those
materially
affected
by
the
corporation’s
conduct.
22


The
report
is
not
required
to
be
disclosed
to
the
public,
or
23


delivered
more
frequently
than
once
every
two
years,
unless
24


otherwise
specified
in
the
benefit
corporation’s
articles
(new
25


Code
section
490.1806(3)).
26


APPLICATION.
The
special
designation
of
a
corporation
as
a
27


benefit
corporation
does
not
by
itself
create
an
implication
28


that
different
rules
apply
to
nonbenefit
corporations.
A
29


specific
provision
governing
a
benefit
corporation
also
does
30


not
affect
any
other
provision
that
applies
to
a
nonbenefit
31


corporation
unless
otherwise
expressly
stated
(new
Code
section
32


490.1808).
