Legislative
findings.
1


The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
the
following:
2


1.
Antisemitism,
and
harassment
on
the
basis
of
actual
3


or
perceived
national
origin,
shared
ancestry,
or
ethnic
4


characteristics
with
a
religious
group,
remains
a
persistent,
5


pervasive,
and
disturbing
problem
in
contemporary
American
6


society.
7


2.
Data
shows
that
Jews
are
among
the
most
likely
of
all
8


minority
groups
to
be
victimized
by
incidents
of
hate,
and
such
9


incidents
are
increasing
at
an
alarming
rate.
10


3.
Campus
antisemitism
is
systemic,
broad,
and
deep,
with
11


recent
studies
showing
that
the
number
of
Jewish
students
12


experiencing
antisemitism
on
campuses
across
the
United
States
13


had
spiked
sharply.
14


4.
State
officials
and
institutions,
including
educational
15


institutions,
have
a
responsibility
to
protect
citizens
from
16


acts
of
hate
and
bigotry
motivated
by
discriminatory
animus,
17


including
antisemitism,
and
must
be
given
the
tools
to
do
so.
18


5.
Valid
monitoring,
informed
analysis
and
investigation,
19


and
effective
policymaking
all
require
uniform
definitions.
20


6.
While
there
is
no
one
exclusive
definition
of
21


antisemitism,
given
the
many
forms
antisemitism
may
take,
for
22


the
purposes
of
this
chapter,
the
specifically
conduct-based
23


definition
of
antisemitism
adopted
by
the
international
24


holocaust
remembrance
alliance,
which
consists
of
over
thirty
25


nations,
and
subsequently
used
by
the
United
States
department
26


of
state
and
the
governments
of
numerous
other
nations,
27


has
been
an
essential
definitional
tool
used
to
determine


28


contemporary
manifestations
of
antisemitism,
and
includes
29


useful
examples
of
discriminatory
anti-Israel
acts
that
cross
30


the
line
into
antisemitism.


31


7.
Awareness
of
this
conduct-based
definition
of
32


antisemitism,
although
it
should
not
be
taken
as
an
exclusive
33


definition,
will
increase
understanding
of
the
parameters
of
34


contemporary
anti-Jewish
crime
and
discrimination
in
certain

The

on
