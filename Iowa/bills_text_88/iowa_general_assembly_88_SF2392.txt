1.
An
unregulated
health
profession
shall
not
be
subject
20


to
regulation
by
any
entity
of
this
state
for
the
purpose
of

All
proposed

Prior
to
considering
proposed
legislation
to
regulate
an
1


unregulated
health
profession
for
passage
to
the
floor
of
the
2


senate
or
the
house
of
representatives,
a
legislative
committee
3


to
which
proposed
legislation
to
regulate
an
unregulated
4


health
profession
has
been
referred
shall
consider
whether
the
5


conditions
in
subsection
1
have
been
met.
If
the
committee
6


finds
that
the
conditions
in
subsection
1
have
been
met,
the
7


committee
shall
consider
whether
the
legislation
is
the
least
8


restrictive
method
of
regulation
to
address
the
specific
harm
9


or
danger
identified
in
this
subsection.
10


a.
If
existing
common
law
and
statutory
civil
actions
and
11


criminal
prohibitions
are
not
sufficient
to
eradicate
existing
12


harm,
the
legislation
shall
provide
for
stricter
civil
actions
13


and
criminal
prohibitions.
14


b.
If
a
service
is
being
performed
for
individuals
that
15


involves
a
hazard
to
the
public
health,
safety,
or
welfare,
the
16


legislation
shall
impose
inspection
requirements
and
enable
an
17


appropriate
state
entity
to
respond
to
a
violation
by
seeking
18


injunctive
relief
in
court.
19


c.
If
the
threat
to
the
public
health,
safety,
or
welfare
20


is
relatively
small
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
21


unregulated
health
profession,
the
legislation
shall
implement
22


a
system
of
registration.
23


d.
If
a
consumer
may
have
a
substantial
basis
for
relying
24


on
the
services
of
a
practitioner
of
an
unregulated
health
25


profession,
the
legislation
shall
implement
a
system
of
26


certification.


27


e.
If
the
legislative
committee
determines
that
adequate
28


regulation
cannot
be
achieved
by
means
other
than
licensing,
29


the
legislation
shall
implement
a
system
of
licensing.

3.
The
legislative
committee
shall
submit
its
findings
31


regarding
whether
the
proposed
legislation
meets
the
conditions

in

With
respect
to
the

of

6


all
of
the
following
shall
be
policies
of
this
state:
7


1.
Occupational

shall
be
construed
and
applied
8


to
increase
economic
opportunities,
promote
competition,
and
9


encourage
innovation.
10


2.
If
the
state
finds
it
is
necessary
to
displace
11


competition,
the
state
shall
use
the
least
restrictive
12


regulation
to
protect
consumers
from
present,
significant,
13


and
substantiated
harms
that
threaten
public
health,

The
policy
of
employing
the
least

regulation
shall
presume
that
market
competition
and
private
16


remedies
are
sufficient
to
protect
consumers.
If
necessary,
17


regulations
shall
be
tailored
to
meet
the
predominate
18


identified
need
to
protect
consumers
as
follows:
19


a.
If
a
regulation
is
intended
to
protect
consumers
against
20


fraud,
the
appropriate
state
action
shall
be
to
strengthen
21


powers
under
deceptive
trade
practices
acts.
22


b.
If
a
regulation
is
intended
to
protect
consumers
against

and
general

safety,
or
welfare
24


concerns,
the
appropriate
state
action
shall
be
to
require
25


periodic

If
a

is

a
consumer
against

to
a
third
party
who
is
not
a

to
a
28


contract
between
the
seller
and

and
other
types
of

externalities,
the
appropriate

action
shall
be
to
require

bonding
or
insurance.

d.
If
a

is
intended
to
protect
a
consumer
against
32


potential
damages
by

shall

in

If
a
regulation
is
required
to
perform
services
21


regulated
by
both
federal
laws
and
the
laws
of
this
state,
22


the
appropriate
state
action
shall
be
to
require
the

to
recognize
an
individual’s
occupational

from
24


another

or
territory
of
the

to
allow

An
occupational

may
be
enforced
against
an

only
to
the
extent
the
