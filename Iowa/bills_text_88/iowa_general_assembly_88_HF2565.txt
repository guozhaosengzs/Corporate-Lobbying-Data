of

payment.
The
notification



shall
contain
the
public
agency’s
assertion
of
its
rights
to



all
or
a
portion
of
the
payment
and

procedure,
the
basis
of

opportunity
to
give



written

or
a
co-payee
of
the



public
payment
received
by
the
department
within
the
time



period

by
its
joint
or
common

g.
The

has
sent



the

,
set

shall
periodically
transfer

reduced
by
any

If
an

notice
of
intent



to
contest
a

the
public

shall
hold
a
refund



or
rebate
until
final
disposition
of
the
challenge.
Upon



completion
of
the
setoff,
the
department
shall
provide
written



notice
of
the
completed
setoff
to
the
obligor
and
any

3.
Challenges

a.
Challenges
under
this
section
may
be
initiated
only
by
an

The
department’s
review
of
a
challenge
to
a
setoff



is
not
subject
to
chapter
17A.



b.
The
obligor
challenging
the
setoff
shall
submit
a
written



challenge
in
the
manner
provided
in
the
notice
described
in



subsection
2,
paragraph
“e”
,
within
fifteen
days
of
the
date
of



the
notice.



c.
The
department,
upon
receipt
of
a
written
challenge,



shall
provide
written
notice
of
the
challenge
to
the
public



agency.
The
department
shall
review
the
information
submitted



by
the
public
agency
prior
to
the
setoff
and
shall
obtain



additional
information
from
the
public
agency
if
necessary
to



establish
that
the
liability
is
a
qualified
debt,
or
to
verify



the
identity
of
the
obligor
or
the
amount
owed.
The
department



shall
set
a
time
to
occur
within
ten
days
of
receipt
of
the



challenge
to
review
the
relevant
facts
of
the
challenge
with



the
obligor.
An
alternative
time
may
be
set
at
the
request



of
the
obligor.
If
the
obligor
does
not
participate
in
the




House
File
2565,
p.
10


review
at
the
scheduled
time
and
an
alternative
time
is
not



requested
and
approved,
the
review
shall
take
place
without
the



obligor
being
present.
Information
in
favor
of
the
obligor



and
the
public
agency
shall
be
considered
in
the
review.
Only



a
determination
that
the
debt
is
not
a
qualified
debt
or
a



mistake
of
fact,
including
a
mistake
in
the
identity
of
the



obligor,
or
a
mistake
in
the
amount
owed,
shall
be
considered



as
a
reason
to
deny
or
modify
the
setoff.



d.
If
the
department
determines
that
a
mistake
of
fact
has



occurred
or
that
the
liability
submitted
does
not
constitute



a
qualified
debt,
the
public
agency
shall
promptly
return
the



setoff
funds
to
the
original
payee
or
payees
unless
there
is



another
qualifying
debt
available
for
setoff.



e.
If
the
department
finds
no
mistake
of
fact
and
that
the



liability
is
a
qualified
debt,
the
department
shall
provide
a



notice
of
that
effect
to
the
obligor
and
the
public
agency,
and



the
public
agency
shall
retain
the
funds
subject
to
setoff.



f.
The
obligor
shall
have
the
right
to
file
an
action
for



wrongful
setoff
in
district
court
within
thirty
days
of
the



date
of
the
notice
to
the
obligor
provided
in
paragraph
“e”
,



either
in
the
county
where
the
obligor
is
located
or
the
county



where
the
main
office
of
the
public
agency
is
located.
The



defendant
in
such
action
shall
be
the
public
agency,
with
an



additional
copy
of
such
petition
to
be
served
upon
the
office



of
the
attorney
general.
Actions
under
this
section
are
in



equity
and
not
actions
at
law
and
are
an
obligor’s
exclusive



remedy
to
challenge
any
action
arising
from
or
related
to
this



section.



g.
Recovery
under
this
subsection
is
limited
to
restitution



from
the
public
agency
of
the
amount
that
has
been
wrongfully



setoff
or
obtained
by
the
public
agency.



h.
A
challenge
under
this
subsection
shall
not
be
used
to



extend,
toll,
or
reopen
the
statute
of
limitations
to
challenge



or
contest
a
qualified
debt.
Only
mistakes
of
fact,
failure



of
the
public
agency
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this



section,
or
a
liability
that
is
not
a
qualified
debt,
shall



constitute
grounds
for
challenge
under
this
subsection.
