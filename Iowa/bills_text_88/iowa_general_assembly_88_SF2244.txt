The
bill
strikes
jail
fees
assessed
against
a
defendant
in
1


Code
section
356.7
from
inclusion
in
restitution
ordered
by
2


the
court.
The
bill
allows
a
county
or
municipality
to
file
a
3


claim
for
reimbursement
of
the
jail
fees
in
a
separate
civil
4


action
rather
than
as
a
restitution
claim
in
the
underlying
5


criminal
case.
The
bill
waives
the
filing
fees
for
such
civil
6


actions.
7


The
bill
makes
changes
to
the
collection
of
court
debt
8


under
Code
section
602.8107.
The
bill
changes
the
definition
9


of
court
debt
to
mean
all
restitution,
fees,
and
forfeited
10


bail.
The
bill
excludes
from
the
definition
of
“court

11


correctional
and
jail
fees
assessed
in
Code
section
356.7
12


(jail)
and
Code
section
904.108(6)
(correctional).
If
a
13


payment
is
made
on
a
court
debt
and
a
case
number
is
not
14


identified,
the
bill
requires
the
clerk
to
apply
the
payment
15


to
pecuniary
damages
in
other
criminal
cases
in
priority
order
16


from
the
oldest
judgment
to
the
most
recent
judgment,
before
17


applying
payments
to
other
court
debt.
The
bill
substitutes
18


the
phrase
“victim
restitution”
with
“pecuniary
damages
as
19


defined
in
section
910.1”
in
Code
section
602.8107(4)(a)
20


(county

21


The
bill
modifies
the
definition
of
restitution
and
creates
22


category
“A”
restitution
and
category
“B”
restitution.
The
23


bill
defines
“restitution”
to
mean
pecuniary
damages,
category
24


“A”
restitution,
and
category
“B”
restitution.
25


Category
“A”
restitution
means
fines,

surcharges.
Category
“B”
restitution
includes
most
other

current

categories
including
the

of

excludes

of

restitution
fees
assessed
under
Code
section
356.7
(jail
fees),
3


and
the

jail
fees
or
court-appointed
expenses
when
the
5


offender
cannot
reasonably
pay
such
fees
and
expenses.
6


The
bill
defines
“financial
affidavit”
in
Code
chapter
910
7


(restitution)
to
mean
a
sworn
affidavit
by
the
offender
about
8


the
current
financial
information
of
the
offender
in
order
to
9


assist
the
sentencing
court
and

of
corrections
to
10


make
a
better
determination
about
the
offender’s
ability
to
pay
11


category
“B”
restitution.
12


The
bill
defines
“restitution
plan
of
payment”
and
“plan
of
13


payment”
as
having
the
same
meaning,
and
defines
“permanent
14


restitution
order”,
“plan
of
restitution”,
and
“temporary
15


restitution
order”.
16


The
bill
strikes
and
replaces
Code
section
910.2
relating
17


to
restitution
or
community
service
ordered
by
a
sentencing
18


court.
The
bill
and
current
law
require
that
any
pecuniary
19


damages
be
paid
by
the
offender
to
the
victim.
The
bill
20


requires
category
“A”
restitution
be
paid
without
regard
21


to
an
offender’s
reasonable
ability
to
make
payments.
The
22


bill
requires
category
“B”
restitution
be
paid
subject
to
an
23


offender’s
reasonable
ability
to
make
payments.
The
bill
24


provides
that
when
an
offender
is
not
reasonably
able
to
pay
25


category
“B”
restitution,
the
court
may
require
the
offender
26


to
perform
community
service
for
a
needed
public
service
for
27


that
portion
of
category
“B”
restitution
the
offender
is
not
28


able
to
reasonably
pay.
If
community
service
is
ordered
in
29


lieu
of
payment
of
court-appointed
attorney
fees,
the
court,
30


when
setting
the
specific
number
of
hours
to
be
performed
by
31


the
offender
to
pay
for
such

shall

the

32


of
hours
of
community
service
by
approximating

The

a
presumption
that

the
offender
is
on
probation,
parole,
or
incarcerated.
The
7


bill
provides
that
a
plan
of
payment
shall
be
based
on
all
8


information
pertinent
to
the

reasonable
ability
to
9


pay,
and
the
