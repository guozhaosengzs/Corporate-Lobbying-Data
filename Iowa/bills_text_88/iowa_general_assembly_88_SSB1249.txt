14


A
corporation
doing
business
both

is
15


required
to
apportion
its
business
income

and
the
16


other
states

business.
The
amount
of
business
17


income
apportioned
to
Iowa
is
generally
in
the
same
percentage
18


as
the
business’s
gross
sales
made
within
Iowa
if
the
business
19


involves
the
manufacture
or
sale
of
goods
and
products,
or
in

the

percentage
as
the

earned
21


within
Iowa
if
the
business
involves
something
other
than
the

manufacture
or
sale
of
goods

products.
However,
airlines

and
other
specified
industries
have
special
rules
provided
24


by
administrative
rule
for
apportioning
the
income
of
those
25


industries.
26


Under
current

pursuant

Iowa
administrative
code,
27


rule
54.7(2),
an
airline
deriving
income
from

apportion
its

Iowa
in
the
same
proportion
that
its
mileage
traveled

to
the
extent
the
AMT
exceeds
the
financial
1


institution’s
regular
tax
liability.
The
AMT
is
generally
2


calculated
by
adding
certain
“preference”
items
(deductions,
3


exemptions,
and
other
adjustments)
back
to
taxable
income,
4


applying
an
exemption
amount,
and
then
multiplying
the
5


resulting
income
amount
by
an
AMT
rate.
The
amendments
to
Code
6


section
422.60
repeal
the
AMT
for
the
franchise
tax
beginning
7


in
tax
year
2021.
8


Current
law
also
provides
an
alternative
minimum
tax
credit,
9


which
allows
AMT
paid
by
a
financial
institution
in
prior
tax
10


years
to
be
claimed
against

liability
in
future
tax

if

AMT
12


in

With
the
repeal
of
the
franchise
AMT
in

13


the
bill
allows
a
taxpayer
to
claim
any
remaining
alternative
14


minimum
tax
credit
against
the
financial
institution’s
regular
15


tax
liability
for
