Sec.
10.
Section
17A.9A,
Code
2020,
is
amended
to
read
as





follows:















House
File
2389,
p.

17A.9A
Waivers
and
variances


.



1.
Any
person
may
petition
an
agency
for
a
waiver
or



variance


from
the
requirements
of
a
rule,
pursuant
to
the



requirements
of
this
section
,
if
the
agency
has
established



by
rule
an
application,
evaluation,
and
issuance
procedure



permitting
waivers
and
variances


.
An
agency
shall
not
grant
a



petition
for
waiver
or
a
variance


of
a
rule
unless
the
agency



has
jurisdiction
over
the
rule
and
the
waiver
or
variance



is
consistent
with
any
applicable
statute,
constitutional



provision,
or
other
provision
of
law.
In
addition,
this



section
does
not
authorize
an
agency
to
waive
or
vary


any



requirement
created
or
duty
imposed
by
statute.



2.
Upon
petition
of
a
person,
an
agency
may
in
its
sole



discretion
issue
a
waiver
or
variance


from
the
requirements



of
a
rule
if
the
agency
finds,
based
on
clear
and
convincing



evidence,
all
of
the
following:



a.
The
application
of
the
rule
would
pose
an
undue
hardship



on
the
person
for
whom
the
waiver
or
variance


is
requested.



b.
The
waiver
or
variance


from
the
requirements
of
a
rule



in
the
specific
case
would
not
prejudice
the
substantial
legal



rights
of
any
person.



c.
The
provisions
of
a
rule
subject
to
a
petition
for
a



waiver
or
variance


are
not
specifically
mandated
by
statute
or



another
provision
of
law.



d.
Substantially
equal
protection
of
public
health,



safety,
and
welfare
will
be
afforded
by
a
means
other
than



that
prescribed
in
the
particular
rule
for
which
the
waiver
or





variance
is
requested.



3.
The
burden
of
persuasion
rests
with
the
person
who



petitions
an
agency
for
the
waiver
or
variance


of
a
rule.
Each



petition
for
a
waiver
or
variance


shall
be
evaluated
by
the



agency
based
on
the
unique,
individual
circumstances
set
out



in
the
petition.
A
waiver
or
variance


,
if
granted,
shall
be



drafted
by
the
agency
so
as
to
provide
the
narrowest
exception



possible
to
the
provisions
of
the
rule.
The
agency
may



place
any
condition
on
a
waiver
or
a
variance


that
the
agency



finds
desirable
to
protect
the
public
health,
safety,
and



welfare.
A
waiver
or
variance


shall
not
be
permanent,
unless



the
petitioner
can
show
that
a
temporary
waiver
or
variance























House
File
2389,
p.
7


would
be
impracticable.
If
a
temporary
waiver
or
variance


is



granted,
there
is
no
automatic
right
to
renewal.
At
the
sole



discretion
of
the
agency,
a
waiver
or
variance


may
be
renewed



if
the
agency
finds
all
of
the
factors
set
out
in
subsection
2



remain
valid.



4.
A
grant
or
denial
of
a
waiver
or
variance


petition
shall



be
indexed,
filed,
and
available
for
public
inspection
as



provided
in
section
17A.3
.
The
administrative
code
editor
and



the
administrative
rules
coordinator
shall
devise
a
mechanism





an
internet
site
to
identify
rules
for
which
a
petition
for
a



waiver
or
variance


has
been
granted
or
denied
and
make
this



information
available
to
the
public.



5.
Semiannually,
each
agency
which
permits
the
granting



of
petitions
for
waivers
or
variances


When
an
agency
grants



a
waiver,
the
agency
shall
submit
the
information
required



by
this
subsection
on
the
internet
site
within
sixty
days.





The
internet
site
shall
prepare
a
report
of
these
actions



identifying
identify
the
rules
for
which
a
waiver
or
variance



has
been
granted
or
denied,
the
number
of
times
a
waiver
or





variance
was
granted
or
denied
for
each
rule,
a
citation
to
the



statutory
provisions
implemented
by
these
rules,
and
a
general



summary
of
the
reasons
justifying
the
agencies’
actions
on
the



waiver
or
variance


request.
To
the
extent
practicable,
this



report


the
agency
shall
detail
include
information
detailing



the
extent
to
which
the
granting
of
a
waiver
or
variance
has



established
a
precedent
for
additional
waivers
or
variances



and
the
extent
to
which
the
granting
of
a
waiver
or
variance



has
affected
the
general
applicability
of
the
rule
itself.



Copies
of
this
report
shall
be
provided
semiannually
to
the





administrative
rules
coordinator
and
the
administrative
rules



review
committee.
