EXPLANATION
5


The

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the

This
bill
creates
a
job

program

(program)
administered
by
the
economic
development
authority
9


(EDA)
in
consultation
with
the
department
of
revenue
(DOR)
10


to
provide
tax
credits
to
businesses
that
employ
for
pay
11


qualified
trainees
in
Iowa
during
the
tax
year.
To
qualify
12


as
a
“qualified
trainee”
under
the
program,
a
person
must
be
13


an
apprentice
or
an
intern,
must
be
employed
by
a
business
in
14


Iowa,
and
must
satisfy
the
relevant
minimum
training
standard.
15


“Apprentice”
is
defined
in
the
bill
to
mean
an
Iowa
resident
16


employed
in
an
apprenticeable
occupation
and
registered
as
such
17


with
the
U.S.
office
of
apprenticeship.
“Intern”
is
defined
18


in
the
bill
to
mean
an
Iowa
college
student,
or
a
student
who
19


graduated
from
high
school
in
Iowa
but
who
now
attends
college
20


outside
of
Iowa,
who
is
engaged
in
temporary
employment
that
21


focuses
on
providing
the
student
with
work
experience
in
the
22


student’s
field
of
study.
23


EDA
is
required
to
establish
by

minimum

EDA
may
consult
in
determining
the
standards.
The
bill
30

EDA
may
establish
more

one
minimum
training
31


standard.
32


In
order
to
receive
a
tax
credit,
a
business
must
apply
33


to
the
authority
in
the
manner
and
form
prescribed
by
the
34


authority,
and
the
bill
describes
the

that

review
applications
and,
upon
determining
that
the
requirements
2


of
the
program
have
been
satisfied,
issue
a
tax
credit
to
the
3


business.
4


The
tax
credit
equals
$1,000
for
each
qualified
trainee
5


employed
in
Iowa
by
a
business
for
the
entire
tax
year.
If
6


a
qualified
trainee
was
not
employed
by
the
business
for
the
7


entire
tax
year,
the
amount
of
the
credit
is
prorated
based
8


upon
the
number
of
months
of
employment.
The
tax
credit
9


may
be
claimed
against
the
individual
and
corporate
income
10


taxes,

franchise
tax,
the
insurance
companies
tax,
and

11


moneys
and

any
excess
may
be
carried
forward
for
13


seven
years.
14


The
bill
requires
EDA
and
DOR
to
adopt
rules
as
necessary
15


for
the
implementation
of
the
bill,
and

and

annual
reports
to
the
governor
and
general
17


assembly
containing
information
as

bill.
