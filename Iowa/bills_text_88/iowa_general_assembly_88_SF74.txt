The

27


district

the

the

favors

the

the

The

Currently,
a

19


of
fewer

250
pupils
in
the
entire

or
certified
20


enrollment
of

must
apply

to
the

for
a

22


before
the

infrastructure
amount
received
for
new

or
for
24


payments
for

issued
for

against

The

modifies
26


the
criteria
to
be
used
by
the
department
of
education
in
27


determining
whether
to
issue
a

to

28


the
