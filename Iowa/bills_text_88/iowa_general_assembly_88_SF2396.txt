Waivers
and
variances


.
4


1.
Any
person
may
petition
an
agency
for
a
waiver
or


5


variance


from
the
requirements
of
a
rule,
pursuant
to
the
6


requirements
of
this
section
,
if
the
agency
has
established
7


by
rule
an
application,
evaluation,
and
issuance
procedure
8


permitting
waivers
and
variances


.
An
agency
shall
not
grant
a
9


petition
for
waiver
or
a
variance
of
a
rule
unless
the
agency
10


has
jurisdiction
over
the
rule
and
the
waiver
or
variance


11


is
consistent
with
any
applicable
statute,
constitutional
12


provision,
or
other
provision
of
law.
In
addition,
this
13


section
does
not
authorize
an
agency
to
waive
or
vary


any
14


requirement
created
or
duty
imposed
by
statute.
15


2.
Upon
petition
of
a
person,
an
agency
may
in
its
sole
16


discretion
issue
a
waiver
or
variance
from
the
requirements
17


of
a
rule
if
the
agency
finds,
based
on
clear
and
convincing
18


evidence,
all
of
the
following:
19


a.
The
application
of
the
rule
would
pose
an
undue
hardship
20


on
the
person
for
whom
the
waiver
or
variance


is
requested.
21


b.
The
waiver
or
variance
from
the
requirements
of
a
rule
22


in
the
specific
case
would
not
prejudice
the
substantial
legal
23


rights
of
any
person.
24


c.
The
provisions
of
a
rule
subject
to
a
petition
for
a
25


waiver
or
variance


are
not
specifically
mandated
by
statute
or
26


another
provision
of
law.
27


d.
Substantially
equal
protection
of
public
health,
28


safety,
and
welfare
will
be
afforded
by
a
means
other
than
29


that
prescribed
in
the
particular
rule
for
which
the
waiver
or


30


variance
is
requested.
31


3.
The
burden
of
persuasion
rests
with
the
person
who
32


petitions
an
agency
for
the
waiver
or
variance


of
a
rule.
Each
33


petition
for
a
waiver
or
variance


shall
be
evaluated
by
the

agency

on

unique,
individual
circumstances

in
the
petition.
A
waiver
or
variance
,
if
granted,
shall
be
1


drafted
by
the
agency
so
as
to
provide
the
narrowest
exception
2


possible
to
the
provisions
of
the
rule.
The
agency
may
3


place
any
condition
on
a
waiver
or
a
variance


that
the
agency
4


finds
desirable
to
protect
the
public
health,
safety,
and
5


welfare.
A
waiver
or
variance
shall
not
be
permanent,
unless
6


the
petitioner
can
show
that
a
temporary
waiver
or
variance
7


would
be
impracticable.
If
a
temporary
waiver
or
variance
is
8


granted,
there
is
no
automatic
right
to
renewal.
