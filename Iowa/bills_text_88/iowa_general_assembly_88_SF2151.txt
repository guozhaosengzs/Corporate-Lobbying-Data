FINDINGS

PURPOSE

Section
1.
FINDINGS
AND
PURPOSE.
3


1.
The
state
of
Iowa
recognizes
that
the
use
of
tobacco
4


products
has
devastating
health
and
economic
consequences.
5


2.
According
to
the
preventing
tobacco
addiction
6


foundation:
7


a.
Commercial
tobacco
use
is
the
foremost
preventable
cause
8


of
premature
death
in
America,
causing
nearly
half
a
million
9


deaths
annually
and
being
responsible
for
over
twenty
million
10


premature
deaths
in
the
United
States
since
the
first
surgeon
11


general
of
the
United
States’
report
on
smoking
in
1964.
12


b.
Tobacco
product
use
leads
to
more
than
three
hundred
13


billion
dollars
in
health
care
and
lost
worker
productivity
14


costs
each
year.
15


c.
Local
governments
recognize
that
young
people
are
16


particularly
susceptible
to
the
addictive
properties
of
tobacco
17


products,
and
youth
that
begin
using
tobacco
products
are
18


particularly
likely
to
become
lifelong
users.
19


d.
Young
brains
are
particularly
susceptible
to
the
20


addictive
properties
of
nicotine,
resulting
in
approximately
21


three
out
of
four
teen
smokers
smoking
into
adulthood.
22


e.
Over
five
million
of
today’s
American
youth
aged
zero
to
23


seventeen
are
projected
to
die
prematurely
from
a
commercial
24


tobacco-related
illness
if
prevalence
rates
do
not
change.
25


f.
National
data
show
that
about
ninety-five
percent
of
26


adults
who
smoke
begin
smoking
before
they
turn
twenty-one
and
27


the
time
between
ages
eighteen
and
twenty
is
a
critical
period
28


when
many
adults
who
smoke
move
from
experimental
smoking
to
29


regular,
daily
use.
30


g.
Data
from
the
national
youth
tobacco
survey
demonstrates
31


that
youth
use
of
electronic
cigarettes
continues
to
increase.
32


The
overall
use
rate
of
electronic
cigarettes
among
youth
33


continues
to
be
higher
than
other
forms
of
tobacco
and
has
34


stymied
previous
progress
in
the
reduction
of
the
overall
35

pf/jh


1/

S.F.
2151


tobacco
use
rate
for
youth.
Furthermore,
the
popularity
1


among
youth
of
newer
products,
such
as
the
brand
JUUL,
which
2


currently
dominates
the
market,
is
likely
responsible
for
the
3


significant
increase
of
electronic
cigarette
usage
among
high
4


school
students.
5


h.
In
2015,
the
institute
of
medicine,
now
the
national
6


academy
of
medicine,
concluded
that
raising
the
minimum
legal
7


sales
age
for
tobacco
products
nationwide
would
reduce
tobacco
8


initiation,
particularly
among
adolescents
aged
fifteen
to
9


seventeen,
improve
health
across
the
lifespan,
and
save
lives;
10


and
that
raising
the
minimum
legal
sales
age
for
tobacco
11


products
nationwide
to
twenty-one
would,
over
time,
lead
to
a
12


twelve
percent
decrease
in
smoking
prevalence.
13


i.
The
institute
of
medicine
also
predicted
that
raising
14


the
minimum
legal
sales
age
for
tobacco
products
nationwide
to
15


twenty-one
would
result
in
over
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
16


fewer
premature
deaths,
fifty
thousand
fewer
deaths
from
lung
17


cancer,
and
over
four
million
fewer
years
of
life
lost
for
18


those
born
between
the
years
2000
and
2019,
and
would
result
in
19


near
immediate
reductions
in
preterm
birth,
low
birth
weight,
20


and
sudden
infant
death
syndrome.
21


j.
A
growing
number
of
state
and
local
jurisdictions
have
22


enacted
minimum
legal
sales
age
twenty-one
policies
to
further
23


restrict
access
to
commercial
tobacco.
24


k.
Three-quarters
of
adults
support
raising
the
minimum
25


legal
sales
age
for
tobacco
products
to
twenty-one,
including
26


seven
out
of
ten
adults
who
smoke.


27


l.
The
financial
impact
of
tobacco
minimum
legal
sales
28


age
twenty-one
policies
on
retailers
is
likely
to
be
minimal.
29


Minimum
legal
sales
age
twenty-one
policies
work
gradually
30


over
time
to
reduce
rates
of
smoking
initiation
and
smoking
31


prevalence.
As
a
result,
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
32


little
short-term
effect
on
tobacco
sales
revenue.


33


m.
Raising
the
minimum
legal
sales
age
of
tobacco
34


products
is
consistent
with
raising
the
legal
drinking
age
to

twenty-one,
which
led
to
reduced
alcohol
use
and
dependence
1


among
youth,
and
contributed
to
the
decline
in
drunk
driving
2


fatalities.
3


n.
Local
governments
have
used
their
authority
to
4


enact
tobacco
control
policies
to
protect
communities
from
5


tobacco-related
harms
and
youth
tobacco
initiation.

The
purpose
of
these
findings
is
to
provide
guidance
7


to
policymakers
and
the
public
and
to
clearly
identify
the
8


problems
to
be
addressed
and
the
rationale
for
the
policy
to
be
9


implemented
in

Act.
