interest
of
the
policyholders,
creditors,
or



shareholders
of
the

will
be
adequately



protected
and
the
plan

of
the
dividing
insurer
and

the
public
interest.

the
interests
of
the



policyholders
of

be
qualified

the
business
of
insurance
in
this
state.



d.
The
proposed

does
not
violate
a
provision

In
a
division

survive,
the
commissioner
shall
apply
chapter

the



dividing
insurer
in
its

as
a

the
following:



(1)
Treat
the
resulting
insurer
as
a
debtor.

Treat
a
liability
allocated
to
the
resulting
insurer
as



a
liability
incurred
by
a
debtor.



(3)
Treat
the
resulting
insurer
as
receiving
unequal
value



in
exchange
for
incurring
allocated
obligations.



(4)
Treat
assets
allocated
to
the
resulting
insurer
as



remaining
assets.



e.
The
proposed
division
is
not
being

for
the
purpose



of
hindering,
delaying,
or
defrauding
any
policyholders

All
resulting
insurers
will
be
solvent
when
the
division



becomes
effective.

remaining
assets

will
not
be



unreasonably
small
in

has
been
engaged
in
or
will
engage
in



after

4.
In
determining
if
the
standards
set
forth

consider
all
proposed

insurer



including
without
limitation
reinsurance
agreements,
parental



guarantees,
support
agreements,
keepwell
agreements,
and



capital
maintenance
of
contingent
capital
agreements
regardless



of
whether
such
qualify
as
an
admitted
asset
under
state
law.



5.
All
expenses
incurred
by
the
commissioner
in
connection



with
proceedings
under
this
section
including
expenses



for
attorneys,

to
assist
the
commissioner

reviewing

paid
by

plan.
A
dividing
insurer
may
allocate
such



expense
in
a
plan
of
division
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other



liability.



6.

approves
a
plan
of
division
the

shall
issue
an
order
which
shall
be
accompanied



by
findings
of
fact
