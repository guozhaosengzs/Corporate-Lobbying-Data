initiative,
to
require
that
the
department
2


of
education
waive
for
one
year
the
educational
standards

for
additional
subjects
when
a
school
district
or
accredited
4


nonpublic
school
proves
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
department
5


that
the
school
district

The

school
level
shall
not
apply
for
up
to
two
specified
15


subjects
at
a
school
district
or
accredited
nonpublic
school
if
16


the
district
or
school
makes
every
reasonable
effort
to
employ
17


a
licensed
teacher
for
the
class
but
is
unable
to
staff
the

class,

the
department
issues
a
waiver,
the
courses
must
be
provided
23


by
the
department’s
Iowa
learning
online
initiative
unless
it
24


lacks
the
capacity,
in
which
case
the
course
may
be
offered
by
25


the
school
district
or
school
through
an
online
platform
or
26


through
a
private

that
meets
standards
approved
by
the
27


director
of
the
department.
