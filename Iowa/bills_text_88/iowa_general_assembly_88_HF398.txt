13


BACKGROUND
——
OPERATIONS
AND
MMPS.
An
operation
is
a
14


location
in
which
certain
confined
agricultural
animals
are
15


housed
in
one
or
more
buildings
for
at
least
45
days
during
16


any
12-month
period
(Code
section
459.102).
Generally,
an
17


operation
must
retain
manure
that
is
produced
at
the
location
18


until
the
manure
is
transported
and
used
according
to
water
19


quality
requirements
(e.g.,
via
application
on
farmland)
(see
20


Code
section
459.311).
An
MMP
refers
to
both
an
original
21


document
and
a
document
which
updates
the
original
plan.
22


An
updated
plan
must
be
filed
with
DNR
on
an
annual
basis
23


(Code
section
459.312).
A
permit
is
required
to
construct
a
24


structure
including
a
confinement
building
or
associated
manure
25


storage
structure
(either
formed
or
unformed)
(Code
section
26


459.102).
As
part
of
the
application
for
a
permit,
the
owner
27


must
have
filed
an
MMP.


28


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill,
if
enacted,
would
take
effect
upon
29


enactment.
