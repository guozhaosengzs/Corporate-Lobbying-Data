BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
the
“Animal
8


Agriculture
Compliance
Act”
(Code
chapter
459)
which
in
9


large
part
provides
for
the
regulation
of
confinement
feeding
10


operations
(operations)
including
associated
confinement
11


feeding
operation
structures
(structures)
such
as
buildings
or
12


manure
storage
structures.
The
Code
chapter
is
regulated
and
13


enforced
by
the
department
of
natural
resources
(DNR)
which
14


also
enforces
provisions
of
other
environmental
regulations
15


such
as
the
federal
Clean
Water
Act
under
the
supervision
of
16


the
United
States
environmental
protection
agency
(EPA).
17


BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
MORATORIUM.
The
bill
prohibits
the
18


construction
of
a
structure,
if
the
structure’s
operation
is
19


located
in
a
subwatershed
that
includes
a
water
body
or
water
20


segment
that
has
been
placed
on
a
list
of
impaired
waters.
The
21


prohibition
would
no
longer
apply
once
the
water
was
removed
22


from
the
list
and
DNR
determined
that
the
water
meets
the
state
23


surface
water
classification
for
primary
contact
recreational
24


use.
25


BACKGROUND.
DNR’s
list
of
impaired
waters
is
approved
by
EPA
26


according
to
federal
and
state
requirements
(33
U.S.C.
§1313
27


and
Code
sections
455B.194
and
455B.195).
DNR
is
also
required
28


to
develop
a
plan
for
restoring
the
impaired
waters,
including
29


by
identifying
its
total
maximum
daily
loads;
commonly
30


referred
to
as
TMDL
that
calculates
the
amount
of
contaminants


31


that
a
water
body
may
receive
and
still
meet
federal
water
32


quality
standards
(40
C.F.R.
§130.7(b)(4)).
Based
on
these
33


measurements,
the
department
classifies
surface
waters
34


for
a
number
of
designated
uses
including
primary
contact

recreational
use
which
means
that
the
water
is
considered
safe
1


for
uses
that
may
result
in
a
person’s
prolonged
and
direct
2


contact
with
the
water,
including
by
ingestion
while
swimming

(33
U.S.C.
§1251(a)(2)
and
567
IAC
61.3).
4


APPLICABLE
PENALTIES.
Under
Code
chapter
459,
different
5


civil
penalties
apply
to
violations
involving
water
quality.
6


A
person
who
violates
a
provision
regulating
water
quality
is
7


subject
to
an
administratively
assessed
civil
penalty
of
not
8


more
than
$10,000,
or
a
judicially
assessed
amount
of
not
more
9


than
$5,000
per
each
day
of
the
violation
(Code
section
459.603
10


referring
to
Code
sections
455B.109
and
455B.191).
11


EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill,
if
enacted,
would
take
effect
upon
12


enactment.
