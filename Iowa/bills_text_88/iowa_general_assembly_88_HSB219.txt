on

EXPLANATION
5


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
6


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
7


This
bill
relates
to
the
membership
of

8


insurance
guaranty
association
and
assessments
to

9


insurers
for
insurance
written

insurers,

provisions.
11


The
bill
amends
Code
chapter
508C
(Iowa
life
and
health
12


insurance
guaranty
association)
to
conform
more
closely
to
13


the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners’
life
and
14


health
guaranty
association
model
act
and
to
adopt
several
of
15


the

act
recently
adopted
by
the
national
16


association
of
insurance
commissioners.
17


The
bill
provides
that
assessments
to
member
insurers
of
the
18


life
and
health
insurance
guaranty
association
(association)
19


for

care
insurance
written

20


insolvent

23


accident

health
member
insurers
and
50
percent
to
be
24


allocated
to

in
the
assessment
for
long-term

the
inclusion
of

Current
31


law
does
not
include
health

The
bill
specifically
provides
33


that
an

is
operating
34


as
a
managed
care
organization
is
excluded
