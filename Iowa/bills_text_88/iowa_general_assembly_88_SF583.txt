as
follows:




Senate
File
583,
p.
3


a.
(1)
An
electric
utility
choosing
to
utilize
the
net



billing
method
shall
file
a
tariff
with
the
board
whereby
a



distributed
generation
customer
pays
all
applicable
charges,



including
applicable
rider
charges
approved
by
the
board
and



applied
to
non-net
metering
customers,
for
the
electricity



delivered
to
the
customer
over
the
net
metering
interval.



A
distributed
generation
customer
shall
be
credited
in



kilowatt-hours
for
energy
exported
to
the
electric
utility
over



the
net
metering
interval.
A
distributed
generation
customer



may
use
the
kilowatt-hour
credits
to
offset
kilowatt-hours



in
future
billing
periods.
The
offset
shall
include
any



applicable
volumetric
rider
charges
approved
by
the
board
and



applied
to
non-net
metering
customers.



(2)
Any
excess
kilowatt-hours
remaining
at
the
end
of



a
twelve-month
period
shall
be
cashed
out
at
the
electric



utility’s
avoided
cost
rate
with
the
funds
from
the
cash
out



divided
evenly
between
the
customer
and
the
electric
utility’s



low-income
home
energy
assistance
program.
The
distributed



generation
customer
shall
choose
either
a
January
or
April
cash



out
date
at
the
time
of
interconnection.



(3)
Net
billing
shall
not
be
limited
in
any
way
based
on
a



customer’s
peak
demand.



(4)
Net
billing
shall
not
include
any
fees
or
charges
that



are
not
charged
to
customers
in
the
same
rate
class
that
are



not
net
billing
customers.



b.
(1)
An
electric
utility
choosing
to
utilize
the



inflow-outflow
billing
method
shall
file
a
tariff
with
the



board
whereby
a
distributed
generation
customer
pays
all



applicable
charges,
including
applicable
rider
charges
approved



by
the
board
and
applied
to
non-net
metering
customers,
for



the
electricity
delivered
by
the
electric
utility
over
the
net



metering
interval.
The
distributed
generation
customer
is



credited
in
dollars
at
the
outflow
purchase
rate
for
energy



exported
to
the
utility
over
the
net
metering
interval.
The



distributed
generation
customer
may
use
the
dollar
credits
to



offset
any
applicable
volumetric
charges,
including
applicable



rider
charges,
billed
on
a
kilowatt-hour
basis.



(2)
The
electric
utility
shall
select
an
hourly
or
subhourly



metering
interval
that
balances
the
benefits
of
accurately




Senate
File

measuring
power
flows
in
each
direction
with
the
cost
of



collecting,
storing,
and
processing
meter
data.



(3)
Inflow-outflow
billing
shall
not
be
limited
in
any
way



based
on
a
customer’s
peak
demand.



(4)
Inflow-outflow
billing
shall
not
include
any
fees
or



charges
that
are
not
charged
to
customers
in
the
same
rate



class
that
are
not
inflow-outflow
customers.



(5)
Prior
to
the
board’s
approval
of
a
value
of
solar



methodology
and
rate,
the
outflow
purchase
rate
for
an
eligible



distributed
generation
facility
shall
be
the
applicable
retail



volumetric
rate,
including
applicable
rider
charges
approved



by
the
board
and
applied
to
non-net
metered
customers.
The



outflow
purchase
rate
for
any
distributed
generation
facility



will
continue
to
be
the
applicable
retail
volumetric
rate



for
a
term
of
twenty
years.
Any
change
in
ownership
of
such



eligible
facility,
or
adoption
and
use
by
the
electric
utility



of
a
value-of-solar
rate
pursuant
to
subsection
4,
shall
not



impact
the
outflow
purchase
rate
for
the
distributed
generation



facility
during
the
twenty-year
term.



4.
Value
of
solar
methodology.
If
the
board
is
petitioned



by
an
electric
utility
after
July
1,
2027,
or
when
the



statewide
distributed
generation
penetration
rate
is
equal
to



five
percent,
whichever
is
earlier,
the
board
shall
initiate



a
proceeding
to
develop
a
value
of
solar
methodology
and



rate
for
eligible
distributed
generation
facilities.
The



value
of
solar
rate
shall
be
determined
through
the
use
of
a



methodology
that
calculates
the
benefits
and
costs
an
eligible



distributed
generation
facility
provides
to,
or
imposes
on,



the
electric
system.
The
value
of
solar
methodology
shall



be
applied
independently
to
each
electric
utility.
When
the



board
determines
the
value
of
solar
methodology,
it
shall



determine
if
there
is
a
need
for
separate
methodologies
for



other
distributed
generation
technologies
or
if
it
can
account



for
the
values
of
other
technologies
with
modifications
to
the



value
of
solar
methodology.



a.
In
establishing
the
methodology,
the
board
shall
initiate



a
formal
proceeding.
The
value
of
solar
methodology
shall
be



determined
through
a
study
conducted
by
an
independent
third



party
and
overseen
by
the
board.
Interested
parties
shall
have




Senate
File
583,
p.

the
opportunity
to
comment
and
offer
testimony
on
any
proposed



value
of
solar
methodology
before
it
is
adopted
by
the
board.



b.
The
benefits
and
costs
in
a
value
of
solar
methodology



shall
include
all
of
the
following
factors
as
appropriate
and



supported
by
known
and
measurable
evidence:



(1)
The
cost
of
energy
and
fuel.



(2)
Generation
capacity
and
reserves.



(3)
Transmission
capacity
and
charges.



(4)
Distribution
capacity.



(5)
Transmission
and
distribution
line
losses.



(6)
Fixed
and
variable
costs
associated
with
plant



operations
and
maintenance.



(7)
Environmental
compliance
costs.



(8)
Integration
costs.



(9)
Grid
support
services.



(10)
Other
factors,
based
on
known
and
measurable
evidence



of
the
cost
or
benefit
of
solar
operations
to
the
electric



utility’s
electric
system.



c.
Upon
approval
of
the
value
of
solar
methodology,
the



outflow
purchase
rate
shall
be
limited
to
either
a
five



percent
increase
or
decrease
from
the
previous
outflow
purchase



rate.
The
value
of
solar
rate
shall
be
recomputed
annually



and
reflected
in
the
outflow
purchase
rate,
limited
to
a



five
percent
increase
or
decrease
from
the
previous
outflow



purchase
rate.
If
the
utility
switches
from
a
net
billing



method
to
an
inflow-outflow
billing
method
after
the
value
of



solar
methodology
is
approved,
then
the
previous
purchase
rate



shall
be
the
applicable
retail
volumetric
rate
including
all



applicable
rider
charges
approved
by
the
board.



d.
The
board
shall
consider,
review,
and
update
as



appropriate
the
value
of
solar
methodology
at
least
every
three



years
after
completion
of
the
initial
methodology.



e.
After
the
board
has
approved
a
value
of
solar
methodology



and
rate,
the
outflow
purchase
rate
shall
be
set
using
the



value
of
solar
methodology.
The
outflow
purchase
rate
for
such



a
facility
will
be
fixed
for
a
term
of
twenty
years
regardless



of
any
subsequent
changes
in
the
electric
utility’s
outflow



purchase
rate
or
changes
in
ownership
of
such
facility.



5.
Forfeiture
of
outflow
purchase
credits.
Any
outflow




Senate
File
583,
p.

purchase
credits
remaining
at
the
end
of
an
annual
period



shall
be
forfeited
to
the
rider
used
by
the
electric
utility



pursuant
to
subsection
7.
The
distributed
generation
customer



shall
choose
either
a
January
or
April
date
at
the
time
of



interconnection
for
the
purposes
of
determining
the
annual



period.



6.
Proposal
of
separate
rate
classes.
An
electric
utility



shall
not
propose
treating
distributed
generation
customers



as
a
separate
rate
class
in
a
general
rate
case
prior
to
the



board’s
approval
of
a
value
of
solar
methodology
or
prior
to



July
1,
2027,
whichever
is
earlier.
If
an
electric
utility



chooses
to
propose
a
separate
rate
class
for
distributed



generation
customers
in
a
future
proceeding,
such
a
proposal



shall
be
approved
or
disapproved
in
accordance
with
section



476.6
and
accompanying
rules.



7.
Riders.
An
electric
utility
shall
be
allowed
to
recover



the
amounts
credited
to
an
eligible
distributed
generation



customer
for
outflow
purchases
pursuant
to
a
rider.
To
the



extent
an
electric
utility
does
not
have
such
a
rider,
the



board
shall
allow
an
electric
utility
to
establish
a
rider
to



recover
such
amounts.
For
purposes
of
this
subsection,
“rider”



includes
a
fuel
or
energy
adjustment
clause.



8.
Preexisting
tariff.
Any
customer
utilizing
a
net
billing



tariff
approved
by
the
board
on
or
before
the
availability



of
inflow-outflow
billing
may
continue
to
receive
electric



service
pursuant
to
the
preexisting
tariff
for
the
remaining



duration
of
the
contract
regardless
of
any
subsequent
changes



in
ownership
of
such
facility.



9.
Use
of
funds
collected
through
alternate
energy
purchase



programs.
An
electric
utility
may
use
funds
collected
pursuant



to
section
476.47
to
offset
any
amounts
that
would
otherwise
be



recovered
through
a
rider
resulting
from
outflow
purchases
of



excess
energy
produced
by
an
eligible
distributed
generation



facility.



10.
Reasonableness
of
net
billing
and
inflow-outflow



billing.
When
the
statewide
net
metering
penetration
level



reaches
ten
percent,
the
board
shall
determine
whether
the



net
billing
and
inflow-outflow
billing
methods
are
still



reasonable
and
shall
make
recommendations
to
the
general




Senate
File
583,
p.

assembly.
Regardless
of
the
board’s
recommendations,
existing



facilities
shall
continue
to
be
eligible
for
the
net
billing



or
inflow-outflow
billing
tariff
in
place
at
the
time
of



installation
and
for
twenty
years
of
operation
thereafter.
