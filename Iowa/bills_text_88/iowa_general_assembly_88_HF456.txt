thereof
the
following:
5


724.16
No
prohibition
to

7


The
availability
of
a

8


under
this
chapter
shall
not
be

EXPLANATION
12


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
13


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
14


This
bill
relates
to
the
carrying
and
possession
of
weapons
15


and
the
acquiring
of
pistols
and
revolvers,
and
provides
16


penalties.
17


CARRYING
AND
POSSESSING
WEAPONS.
The
bill
amends
Code
18


section
724.4
by
striking
the
current
penalty

Instead,
the
bill
amends
the
current
crime
20


of
going
armed
with
a
knife
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
an
21


aggravated
misdemeanor
to
provide
that
a
person
who
goes
armed
22


with
a
knife
on
or
about
the
person,
or
who
used
the
knife
in
23


the
commission
of
a
crime,
commits
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
24


An
aggravated
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
25


no
more
than
two
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$625
but
not
26


more
than
$6,250.
The
bill
makes
a
conforming
change
to
Code
27


section
232.52(2)
relating
to
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
28


a
juvenile’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privilege
and
a
29


conforming
change
to
Code
section
724.2A
due
to
the
strike
of
30


Code
section
724.4
in
the
bill.
The
bill
also
makes
a
change
31


to
Code
section
724.4B,
relating
to
the
carrying
of
weapons
on
32


school
grounds,
to
specifically
include
certain
categories
of

persons
who

duty
to
carry
a
valid
permit
to
carry
certain
weapons
for
1


which
a
permit
has
been
issued
to
the
person
and
replaces
that
2


Code
section
with
language
providing
that
the
availability
3


of
a
professional
or
nonprofessional
permit
to
carry
weapons
4


shall
not
be
construed
to
impose
a
general
prohibition
on
5


the
unlicensed
carrying,
whether
openly
or
concealed,
of
a
6


dangerous
weapon,
including
a
loaded
firearm.
7


ACQUIRING
PISTOLS
AND
REVOLVERS.
The
bill
amends
Code
8


section
724.15
by
striking
the
requirement
that
a
person
obtain
9


a
permit
to
acquire
ownership
of
any
pistol
or
revolver.
Under
10


the
bill,
a
person
can
still
apply
and
obtain
a
permit
to
11


acquire
ownership
of
a
pistol
or
revolver
if
the
applicant
12


meets
certain
requirements.
An
applicant
also
maintains
the
13


right
to
appeal
a
denial
of
an
application
for
a
permit
to
14


acquire
pistols
or
revolvers.
However,
the
availability
of
a
15


permit
to
acquire
a
pistol
or
revolver
shall
not
be
construed
16


to
impose
a
general
prohibition
on
the
unlicensed
acquiring
17


of
ownership
of
a
pistol
or
revolver.
The
bill
strikes
Code
18


section
724.16,
which
provides
a
penalty
(class
“D”
felony)
for
19


persons
who
acquire
ownership
of
a
pistol
or
revolver
without
a
20


valid
permit
or
who
transfer
ownership
of
a
pistol
or
revolver
21


to
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
valid
permit
to
acquire
pistols
22


or
revolvers.
