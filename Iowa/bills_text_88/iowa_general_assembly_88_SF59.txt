EXPLANATION
7


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


Under
current
law,
a
consumer
may
return
an
empty
beverage
10


container
upon
which
a
refund
value
has
been
paid
to
a
dealer
11


or
a
redemption
center.
When
a
distributor
collects
empty
12


beverage
containers
from
a
dealer,
dealer
agent,
or
redemption
13


center,
the
distributor
reimburses
the
dealer,
dealer
agent,
or
14


redemption
center
the
refund
value
plus
a
1-cent
handling
fee
15


for
each
empty
beverage
container.
Current
law
also
allows
any
16


person
to
establish
a
redemption
center
that
serves
a
dealer
17


if
it
is
approved
by
the
department
of
natural
resources.
Any
18


person
can
also
establish
an
unapproved
redemption
center.
19


Under
this
bill,
a
consumer
must
return
an
empty
beverage
20


container
to
a
redemption
center
if
the
consumer
seeks
21


to
redeem
a
refund
value
paid
for
the
beverage
container.
22


Additionally,
the
handling
fee
paid
by
a
distributor
is
23


increased
to
2
cents
for
each
empty
beverage
container.
A
24


distributor
must
pick
up
from
a
redemption
center
empty
25


beverage
containers
on
at
least
a
weekly
basis.
The
bill
makes
26


conforming
changes
throughout
Code
chapter
455C
to
remove
27


instances
of
“dealer”
and
“dealer
agent”
from
provisions
28


dealing
with
redemption.
Lastly,
the
bill
requires
all
29


redemption
centers
to
be
approved
by
the
department;
any
30


unapproved
redemption
center
that
currently
exists
can
continue
31


operating
without
approval
until
December
1,
2020.
32


The
bill
takes
effect
on
July
1,
2020.
