3.
The

may
conduct
a
hearing
to
determine

emancipation,
or
attainment
of
majority.



2.

if
the
court
finds
that
the
basis



for
the
guardianship
set
forth
in
section
232D.203
is
not



currently
satisfied
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
termination



of
the
guardianship
would
be
harmful
to
the
minor
and
the



minor’s
interest

section

the
burden
of
making
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the



guardianship
should
be
terminated.
If
such
a
showing
is
made,



the
guardian
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
prove
by
clear



and
convincing
evidence
that
the
guardianship
should
not
be



terminated.



4.
The
court
shall
modify
the
powers
granted
to
the
guardian



if
the
court

the



minor
or
are
not
in
the
minor’s
best
interest.



5.
The
court
may
conduct
a
hearing

termination

modification
of
a
guardianship

fourteen
years

or



older
who
is
under

a

For
purposes



of
assessing
costs
under

be
indigent
if
the
minor’s
or
the

income
and
resources
do
not
exceed
one
hundred
fifty
percent



of
the
federal
poverty
level,
or
the

parent
would
be



unable
to
pay
such
costs
without
prejudicing
the
parent’s



ability
to
provide
economic
necessities
for
the
