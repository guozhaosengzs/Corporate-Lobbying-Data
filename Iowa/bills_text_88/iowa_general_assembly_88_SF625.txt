“Empower
Rural
Iowa
Act”.
1


Current
law
requires
the
OCIO
to
administer
a
broadband
2


grant
program
to
award
grants
to
communications
service
3


providers
that
reduce
or

as

by

10


benchmarks
identified

11


in
its
most

14


Current

communications
service
provider
facilitates

service
16


meeting
the
requisite

shall
be
17


ascertained
by
reference
to
certain
broadband
availability
18


maps
or
data
sources
identified
by
the
OCIO
by
rule.
The
bill
19


requires
the
OCIO
to
periodically
make
renewed
determinations
20


of
whether
such
a
provider
facilitates
broadband
service
21


at
or
above
the
requisite
speeds,
including
making
such
22


determinations
prior
to
each
round
of
grant
applications.
23


The
bill
provides
that
the
broadband
grant
program
shall
24


be
designed
to
reduce
or
eliminate
unserved
and
underserved
25


areas
in
Iowa,
leveraging
federal
funds

infrastructure
that
facilitates
broadband
service
in
targeted
29


service
areas
at

speeds.
31


Current
law
allows
unencumbered
or
unobligated
moneys
32


remaining
in
the
broadband
grant
fund
at
the
close
of
the
33


fiscal
year
to
remain
available
for
use
until
the
close

the
34


succeeding

The
bill
allows
the
OCIO
to
increase
the
minimum
download

4


upload
speeds
for

grant
eligibility
by
rule.
5


The
bill
requires

as
described

requires
the
OCIO
to
identify
certain
8

10


Current
law
provides
certain
factors
for
the
OCIO
to
11


consider

The

modifies
such
factors

broadband
grants
only

administer
Code
