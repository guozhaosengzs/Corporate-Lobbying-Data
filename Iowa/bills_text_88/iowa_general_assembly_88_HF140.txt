However,
an
amount
is
to
be
transferred
10


to
a
new
animal

11


of
DALS.
The
bill
requires
DALS
to
perform
inspections
and
12


licensees

maintain
records.
The
bill
provides
that
DALS
may
13


take
disciplinary
action
by
suspending
or
revoking
the
person’s
14


license.
It
provides
that
any
continuing
education
program
15


voluntarily
completed
by
a
person
operating
a
commercial
16


establishment

The
bill

19


Greyhound

used
in
pari-mutuel
wagering
are
exempted
from
20


regulation.
Finally,
the
bill
provides
that
the
attorney
21


general
or
a
county
attorney
may
bring
a
criminal
action
in
22


order
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
Code
chapter
and
allows
