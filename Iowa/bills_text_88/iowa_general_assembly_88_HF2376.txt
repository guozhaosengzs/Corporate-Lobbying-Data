the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members

assembly.

GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
the
regulation
of
9


commercial
establishments
maintaining
animals,
other
than
10


livestock
or
other
agricultural
animals,
by
the
department
11


of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(DALS).
A
commercial
12


establishment
includes
an
animal
shelter,
boarding
kennel,
13


commercial
breeder,
commercial
kennel,
dealer,
pet
shop,
pound,
14


public
auction,
or
research
facility.
15


REGISTRANTS.
The
bill
requires
certain
persons
to
obtain
16


a
certificate
of
registration,
including
persons
who
provide
17


rescue
and
sanctuary
services.
Currently,
a
registrant
18


includes
an
animal
shelter,
pound,
and
research
facility.
19


A

for
20


deposit
in
the
commercial
establishment
fund
and
is

24


is

A

Generally,

the

all
legal
rights
in
the
animal
to
the
29


transferee.

33


other

the
registrant
must
make
efforts
to
find
34


the
