Legislative
intent.

The
legislature
finds
and
declares
all
of
the
following:
7


1.
Iowa’s
communities
are
important
to
the
social
and
8


economic
vitality
of
this
state.
Whether
urban,
suburban,
9


or
rural,
many
communities
are
struggling
with
dilapidated,
10


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
properties.
11


2.
Citizens
of
Iowa
are
affected
adversely
by
dilapidated,
12


abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
properties,
13


including
properties
that
have
been
abandoned
due
to
mortgage
14


foreclosure.
15


3.
Dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
tax-delinquent
16


properties
impose
significant
costs
on
neighborhoods
and
17


communities
by
lowering
property
values,
increasing
fire
18


and
police
protection
costs,
decreasing
tax
revenues,
and
19


undermining
community
cohesion.
20


4.
There
is
an
overwhelming
public
need
to
confront
the
21


problems
caused
by
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
and
22


tax-delinquent
properties;
to
return
properties
that
are
in
23


non-revenue-generating,
non-tax-producing
status
to
productive
24


status
in
order
to
revitalize
urban,
suburban,
and
rural
25


areas,
provide
affordable
housing,
and
attract
new
industry;
26


and
to
create
jobs
for
the
citizens
of
this
state
through
the
27


establishment
of
new
tools
that
enable
communities
to
turn


28


abandoned
spaces
into
vibrant
places.
29


5.
Land
banks
are
one
of
the
tools
that
communities
can
use
30


to
facilitate
the
return
of
dilapidated,
abandoned,
blighted,
31


and
tax-delinquent
properties
to
productive
use.

This

6


Division

properties
in
their

communities
to
economically
productive
status.
An

10


land
bank
is
a
public
agency
for
the

of
joint
exercise
11


of
governmental
powers,
a
governmental
body
for

12


of
public

requirements
of
Code
chapter
21,
and
a
13


government
body
for

that

allowing

the

up

75

of
real

taxes
collected
29


on
a
