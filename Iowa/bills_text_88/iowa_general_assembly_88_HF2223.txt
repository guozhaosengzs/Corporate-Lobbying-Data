employer
taking
any

action
against
an

not
12


more
than
$500
per
pay
period
for
each
violation.
The
bill
13


provides
administrative
and
judicial
processes
for
imposing
and
14


recovering
such
penalties.
15


The
bill
shall
not
be
construed
to
discourage
or
prohibit
16


an
employer
from
the
adoption
or
retention
of
a
policy
that
17


meets
or
exceeds
but
does
not
otherwise
conflict
with
the
18


minimum
standards
and
requirements
provided
in
the
bill.
If
19


any
provision
of
the
bill
conflicts
with
a
provision
of
an
20


applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
provision
of
21


the
collective
bargaining
agreement
shall
govern.

for
certain
family

reasons
for
27


eligible

28


An

Act
of

1993,
as
amended
(FMLA).
Medical

due
to
4


the
employee’s
own
serious
health
condition.
Serious
health
5


condition
is
defined
in
the
bill.
6


The
bill
provides
that
an
eligible
employee
may
not
receive
7


more
than
12
weeks
of
family
leave,
12
weeks
of
medical
leave,
8


or
16
weeks
of
combined
family
and
medical
leave
in
a
defined
9


consecutive
12-month
period.
The
defined
consecutive
12-month
10


period
begins
on
the
date
of
the
birth
of
a
child
or
placement
11


of
a
child
for
adoption
or
foster
care
with
an
eligible
12


employee,
or
on
the
first
date
that
an
eligible
employee
takes
13


either
family
leave
or
medical
leave.
The
minimum
duration
of
14


leave
an
eligible
employee
may
take
is
eight
consecutive
hours.
15


An
employee
is
disqualified
for
family
leave
and
medical
16


leave
benefits
for
an
absence
due
to
the
employee
purposefully
17


causing
injury
or
sickness
to
the
employee
or
a
family
member,
18


for
an
absence
caused
by
an
illness
or
injury
due
to
the
19


employee
engaging
in
an
illegal
act,
or
an
absence
due
to
an
20


employer
taking
disciplinary
action
against
the
employee.
21


An
employee
must
provide
a
minimum
of
30
days
notice
to
an
22


employer
of
the
employee’s
intent
to
take
leave
for
the
birth
23


of
a
child
or
placement
of
a
child
for
adoption
or
foster
care,
24


or
of
the
employee’s
intent
to
take
family
leave
or
medical
25


leave.
If
circumstances
require
an
employee’s
leave
to
begin
26


in
less
than
30
days,
the
employee
must
give
as
much
notice
as
27


is
practicable.
If
an
eligible
employee
requests
medical
leave
28


or
family
leave,
the
employee
must
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
29


schedule
their
own,
or
their
family
member’s
medical
treatment,
30


to
not
unduly
disrupt
the
employer’s
operations.
31


The
bill
requires
an
eligible
employee
to
file
a
claim
32


for
benefits
as
required
by
the
director.
The
employee
33


must
consent
to
the
disclosure
of
potentially
private
or
34


confidential

2223


employee’s
employer,
for
administration
of
the
family
leave
1


or
medical
leave.
The
bill
specifies
that
such
information
2


is
not
a
public
record
pursuant
to
Code
section
22.1.
The
3


employee
must
attest
that
the
employee
has
provided
notice
of
4


the
employee’s
intent
to
take
leave
to
the
employee’s
employer.
5


The
employee
must
also
authorize
the
employee’s,
or
the
6


employee’s
family
member’s
health
care
provider,
to
complete
7


a
certification
of
a
serious
health
condition
as
required
by
8


the
director.
9


The
bill
provides
for
a
seven-day
waiting
period
before
10


benefits
are
payable.
There
is
no
waiting
period
for
benefits
11


for
leave
for
the
birth
of
a
child
or
placement
of
a
child
for
12


adoption
or
foster
care.
13


The
basis
for
the
calculation
of
the
amount
of
a
family
14


leave
or
medical
leave
benefit
is
an
eligible
employee’s
weekly
15


earnings
as
defined
in
the
bill.
The
weekly
leave
benefit
16


amount
payable
to
an
employee
for
any
one
week
is
80
percent
17


of
the
employee’s
weekly
spendable
earnings,
but
must
not
18


exceed
an
amount
equal
to
200
percent
of
the
statewide
average
19


weekly
wage
paid
to
employees
as
determined
by
the
department
20


of
workforce
development.
The
minimum
weekly
leave
benefit
21


amount
is
equal
to
the
weekly
leave
benefit
amount
of
a
person
22


whose
gross
weekly
earnings
are
35
percent
of
the
statewide
23


average
weekly
wage,
or
to
the
spendable
weekly
earnings
of
the
24


employee,
whichever
is
less.
“Spendable
weekly
earnings”
is
25


defined
in
the
bill
as
the
amount
remaining
after
payroll
taxes
26


are
deducted
from
an
employee’s
gross
weekly
earnings.
27


The
department
must
send
the
first
benefit
payment
to
an
28


eligible
employee
within
10
days
after
a
properly
completed
29


weekly
claim
for
benefits
is
received
by
the
department.
If
30


the
employee
continues
to
submit
a
properly
completed
weekly
31


claim,
subsequent
payments
are
to
be
made
to
the
employee
at
32


least
biweekly.
If
an
employer,
or
the
department,
contests
33


an
employee’s
eligibility,
benefit
payments
may
be
made
on
34


a
conditional
basis.
The
employee
is
required
to
pay
the
35

benefits
back
if
the
department
later
rules
that
the
employee
1


is
ineligible
to
receive
such
benefits.
2


The
bill
provides
that
the
program
shall
be
funded
via
3


employee
and
employer
contributions.
Beginning
on
January
1,
4


2023,
and
ending
on
December
31,
2024,
the
department
must
5


assess
a
covered
employer
a
premium
rate
of
four-tenths
of
one
6


percent
of
an
employee’s
weekly
wages,
subject
to
a
maximum
7


limit
of
wages
subject
to
the
assessment,
as
determined
by
8


the
director
based
on
the
maximum
wages
subject
to
taxation
9


for
social
security.
One-third
of
the
premium
is
to
be
used
10


to
fund
family
leave
insurance
benefits
and
two-thirds
of
the
11


premium
is
to
be
used
to
fund
medical
leave
benefits.
The
12


covered
employer
may
deduct
the
full
amount
of
the
family
leave
13


premium
from
an
employee’s
wage.
A
covered
employer
may
deduct
14


up
to
45
percent
of
the
medical
leave
premium
and
45
percent
of
15


the
family
leave
premium
from
an
employee’s
wage.
The
employer
16


must
pay
the
remaining
55
percent
of
both
the
medical
leave
and
17


family
leave
premiums,
and
may
elect
to
pay
all
or
any
portion
18


of
an
employee’s
share
of
such
premiums.
Beginning
January
19


1,
2025,
the
premium
rate
shall
be
calculated
by
the
director
20


based
on
the
family
leave
and
medical
leave
insurance
account
21


balance
ratio
as
of
September
30
of
the
previous
calendar
year.
22


The
premium
rate
is
adjusted
based
on
the
balance
ratio
as
23


detailed
in
the
bill.
If
the
balance
ratio
falls
below
five
24


hundredths
of
one
percent,
the
bill
requires
the
director
to
25


assess
a
solvency
surcharge
that
is
added
to
the
total
premium
26


rate
assessed
to
a
covered
employer.
The
minimum
solvency
27


surcharge
is
one-tenth
of
one
percent
and
the
maximum
is
28


six-tenths
of
one
percent.
29


On
September
30
of
each
year,
the
bill
requires
the
30


department
to
average
the
number
of
employees
reported
by
an
31


employer
over
the
last
four
completed
calendar
quarters
to
32


determine
if
the
employer
is
a
covered
employer
for
the
next
33


calendar
year.
34


The
bill
requires
a
covered
employer
to
collect
all
assessed

premiums
and
surcharges
from
the
employer’s
employees
through
1


payroll
deduction
and
to
remit
all
premiums
to
the
department
2


as
required
by
the
director.
3


An
employer
may
apply
for,
and
the
director
must
grant,
a
4


waiver
of
premiums
for
an
employee
who
is
located
physically
5


outside
of
the
state
and
not
expected
to
work
in
the
state
for
6


1,250
or
more
hours
in
any
consecutive
12-month
period.
If
7


the
employee
subsequently
works
1,250
or
more
hours
within
8


the
state,
the
employer
and
employee
are
responsible
for
all
9


premiums
that
should
have
been
collected.
10


Self-employed
persons
may
elect
to
participate
in
the
11


program
for
a
minimum
initial
participation
period
of
three
12


years.
Any
subsequent
period
of
participation
must
be
for
13


a
minimum
of
one
year.
A
self-employed
person
must
pay
14


the
employee
and
employer’s
portion
of
the
premium
assessed
15


by
the
director.
A
self-employed
person
who
elects
to
16


participate
in
the
program
is
eligible
for
family
leave
and
17


medical
leave
benefits
after
working
a
minimum
of
1,250
hours
18


in
the
consecutive
12-month
period
immediately
following
19


the
person’s
election
to
participate
in
the
program.
The
20


self-employed
person
may
withdraw
from
the
program
by
providing
21


written
notice
to
the
director.
The
director
may
cancel
the
22


self-employed
person’s
elective
coverage
for
failure
to
submit
23


the
required
premiums.
24


An
eligible
employee
who
takes
family
leave
or
medical
leave
25


is
entitled
to
restoration
of
employment
equal
to
but
not
26


greater
than
that
provided
by
FMLA.
The
bill
provides
that
if
27


required
under
FMLA,
an
employer
must
maintain
any
existing
28


health
benefits
during
an
employee’s
leave.
If
the
employer
29


and
employee
normally
share
the
cost
of
such,
the
employee
is
30


responsible
for
paying
the
employee’s
share
of
the
costs.
31


A
covered
employer
must
submit
reports
as
required
by
the
32


director
and
maintain
employment
records
for
each
employee
33


from
which
the
director
may
obtain
information
related
to
an
34


employee’s
family
leave
or
medical
leave.
Such
records
must

years
from
the
date
on
which
an

first
takes
a
family

The
bill
provides
that
family
leave
or
medical
leave
shall
3


be
in
addition
to
leave
required
under
state
or
federal
law
4


for
sickness
or
temporary
disability
due
to
pregnancy
or
5

The
bill
requires
family
leave
or
medical
leave
6


taken
under
this
program
to
be
taken
concurrently
with
leave
7


taken
under
FMLA.
A
covered
employer
may
allow
an
employee
8


to
choose
to
use
either
accrued
sick
or
vacation
benefits,
or
9


family
leave
and
medical
leave
benefits.
An
employee
cannot
10


receive
family
or
medical
leave
benefits
at
the
same
time
the
11


employee
is
receiving
state
or
federal
unemployment,
workers’
12


compensation,
or
disability
benefits.
The
bill
prohibits
13


discrimination
on
the
basis
of
any
state
or
federally
protected
14


category.
15


The
bill
requires
the
director
to
administer
the
program
and
16


to
provide
outreach
to
ensure
that
employers
and
employees
are
17


aware
of
the
program
and
the
benefits
available
under
such.
18


The
bill
provides
that
a
family
leave

19


insurance
account
shall
be
created
in
the
custody
of
the
20


treasurer
of
state.
The
director
shall
deposit
all

21


collected
from
employers
into
such
account
and
the
account
can
22


only
be
used
for
the
program
as
authorized
by
the
director.
23


The
bill
requires
the
director
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
24


the
provisions
of
the
bill.
The
director
may
take
any
action
25


under
the
director’s
authority
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
26


bill.


27


The
director
is
required
to
analyze
the
funding
of
the

program
and

29


The

shall
determine
if
the
premium
rates
and

benefit
levels
are
appropriate
to
fully
fund
and
maintain
the
