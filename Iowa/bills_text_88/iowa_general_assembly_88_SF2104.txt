the
1


governing
body

13

Division
II
of
the
bill
provides
for
an
adjustment
in
21


the
assessed
value
of
a
homestead,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
22


if
the
owner’s
household
income
consists
of
50
percent
or
23


more

security
income
or
pension
income.
If

qualifications
are
met,
the

taxes
are
levied
in

year
is
the

same

year.
The

assessed
value
is

rollback
being
applied.

receives
31


the
adjustment
without
