The

to
extending
the
periods
of
time
a

12


against

Under

discovery
of

by
an

DIVISION
V
——
CRIMINAL
PROCEEDINGS.

DEFENDANT
RIGHT
TO
APPEAL.
This
division
amends
Code
21


section
814.6(1)
by
prohibiting
the
right
to
appeal
to
a
22


defendant
who
has
pled
guilty
to
a
criminal
offense
except
23


this
prohibition
does
not
apply
to
a
defendant
who
pleads
24


guilty
to
a
class
“A”
felony.
The
right
to
appeal
means
that
25


an
appellate
court
cannot
deny
a
defendant’s
statutory
or
26


constitutional
right
to
have
the
defendant’s
case
reviewed
on
27


appeal.
28


The
division
amends
Code
section
814.6(2)
by
specifying
that
29


discretionary
review
by
an
appellate
court
applies
to
an
order
30


denying
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
on
grounds
other
than
an
31


ineffective

claim.
Under
current
law,
discretionary
32


review
applies
to
an
order
suppressing
or
admitting
evidence,
33


an
order
granting
or
denying
a

for
a

an

raising

important

Discretionary

the

process
by
which
an

court
may
exercise
its
discretion

to

PRO
SE
FILINGS
BY
DEFENDANT
CURRENTLY
REPRESENTED
BY
6


COUNSEL.
The
division
creates
new
Code
section
814.6A
relating
7


to
pro
se
filings
by
defendants
currently
represented
by
8


counsel.
The
bill
provides
that
a
defendant
who
is
currently
9


represented
by
counsel
shall
not
file
any
pro
se
document
10


in
any
Iowa
appellate
court.
The
appellate
court
shall
not
11


consider,
and
opposing
counsel
shall
not
respond
to,
such
pro
12


se
filings.
The
division
does
not
prohibit
a
defendant
from
13


proceeding
without
the
assistance
of
counsel.
A
defendant
14


currently
represented
by
counsel
may
file
a
pro
se
motion
15


seeking
disqualification
of
the
counsel,
which
a
court
may
16


grant
upon
a
showing
of
good
cause.
17


INEFFECTIVE
ASSISTANCE
OF
COUNSEL
CLAIMS
ON
APPEAL.
The
18


division
amends
Code
section
814.7
relating
to
an
ineffective
19


assistance
claim
on
appeal
in
a
criminal
case.
The
division
20


prohibits
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
being
raised
and
21


decided
on
direct
appeal
from
the
criminal
proceedings.
Under
22


current
law,
such
a
claim
may
be
raised
on
direct
appeal
from
23


the
criminal
proceedings
if
the
record
at
the
trial
level
is
24


sufficient.
Generally,
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
25


claim
is
raised
on
appeal
by
a
criminal
defendant
alleging
26


the
defendant’s
attorney
was
so
incompetent
it
deprived
the
27


defendant
the
constitutional
right
to
assistance
of
counsel.
28


APPEALS
FROM
THE
DISTRICT
COURT
——
GENERAL
VERDICT.


29


The
division
creates
new
Code
section
814.28
relating
to
30


general
verdicts.
When
the
prosecution
relies
on
multiple
31


or
alternative
theories
to
prove
the
commission
of
a
public
32


offense,
a
jury
may
return
a
general
verdict.
If
the
jury
33


returns
a
general
verdict,
the
division
specifies
that
a
court
34


shall
not
set
aside
or
reverse
such
a
verdict
on
the
basis
35

of
a

if
one
or
more
of
the
1


theories
presented
and
described
in
the
complaint,
information,
2


indictment,
or
jury
instruction
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
3


verdict
on
at
least
one
count.
4


GUILTY
PLEAS
——
CHALLENGES.
If
a
defendant
challenges
a
5


guilty
plea
based
on
an
alleged
defect
in
the
plea
proceedings,
6


the
division
provides
that
the
plea
shall
not
be
vacated
unless
7


the
defendant
demonstrates
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
8


defendant
would
not
have
pled
guilty
if
the
defect
had
not
9


occurred.
The
burden
applies
whether
the
challenge
is
made
10


by
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
or
in
a
challenge
on
appeal.
11


Any
provision
in
the
Iowa
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
are
12


inconsistent
with
this
provision
shall
have
no
legal
effect.
13


POSTCONVICTION
RELIEF.
The
division
provides
that
an
14


ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
contained
in
an
15


application
seeking
postconviction
relief
is
not
a
ground
16


of
fact
or
law
that
could
not
have
been
raised
within
the
17


applicable
time
period
for
purposes
of
determining
if
an
18


application
is
timely
filed.
19


The
division
provides
that
an
applicant
seeking
20


postconviction
relief
who
is
currently
represented
by
counsel
21


shall
not
file
any
pro
se
document
in
any
Iowa
district
or
22


appellate
court.
The
district
or
appellate
court
shall
not
23


consider,
and
opposing
counsel
shall
not
respond
to,
such
24


pro
se
filings.
The
bill
does
not
prohibit
an
applicant
for
25


postconviction
relief
from
proceeding
without
the
assistance
of
26


counsel.
A
represented
applicant
for
postconviction
relief
may
27


file
a
pro
se
motion
seeking
disqualification
of
counsel,
which
28


a
court
may
grant
upon
a
showing
of
good
cause.
29


The
division
strikes
a
provision
that
requires
the
30


respondent
to
an
application
for
postconviction
relief,
to
file
31


an
answer
to
the
application
with
relevant
portions
of
the
32


record
of
the
proceedings
being
challenged,
if
the

33


fails
to

the
application
without
the

At

the

attorney
an
opportunity
to

7


on
the

address
the

in

order
to

or
present
9


any
information
to
mitigate
the

and
provide
the
10


prosecuting
attorney
an
opportunity
to

11


After
hearing
any
statements
presented
by
the
above,
and
12


before
imposing

the
court
is
required
to
address
any

who
