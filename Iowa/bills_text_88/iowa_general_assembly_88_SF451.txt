If

this

upon
delivery
of

the

substance
by
the

of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
relates
to
workers’
compensation.

The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.16(2)(b),
concerning
4


intoxication,
by
striking
the
paragraph.
Current
law
provides
5


that
no
compensation
under
Code
chapter
85
shall
be
allowed
for
6


an
injury
caused
by
Code
section
85.16(1),
which
is
willful
7


injury,
or
Code
section
85.16(2),
which
is
an
employee’s
8


intoxication.
By
striking
Code
section
85.16(2)(b),
a
9


presumption
regarding
intoxication
is
removed.
The
presumption
10


provides
that
if
the
employer
shows
that,
at
the
time
of
the
11


injury
or
immediately
following
the
injury,
the
employee
had
12


positive
test
results
reflecting
the
presence
of
alcohol,
13


or
another
narcotic,
depressant,
stimulant,
hallucinogenic,
14


or
hypnotic
drug
which
drug
either
was
not
prescribed
by
an
15


authorized
medical
practitioner
or
was
not
used
in
accordance
16


with
the
prescribed
use
of
the
drug,
it
shall
be
presumed
that
17


the
employee
was
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
injury
and
that
18


intoxication
was
a
substantial
factor
in
causing
the
injury.
19


Code
section
85.16(2)(b)
also
provides
that
once
the
employer
20


has
made
a
showing
of
presumed
intoxication,
the
burden
of
21


proof
shall
be
on
the
employee
to
overcome
the
presumption
22


by
establishing
that
the
employee
was
not
intoxicated
at
the
23


time
of
the
injury,
or
that
intoxication
was
not
a
substantial
24


factor
in
causing
the
injury.
25


The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.18,
concerning
the
ability
26


of
a
contract
to
relieve
an
employer
of
liability,
to
eliminate
27


a
provision
which
stated
that
the
Code
section
does
not
create
28


a
private
cause
of
action.
29


The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.23,
requiring
notice
of
30


injury,
and
Code
section
85.26(1),
concerning
limitations
of
31


actions,
to
remove
definitions
of
“date
of
the
occurrence
of
32


the
injury”
to
mean
the
date
the
employee
knew
or
should
have
33


known
that
the
injury
was
work-related.
34


The
bill
removes
a
presumption

what
occurs

turn
down
offers

The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.34(2),
concerning
permanent
10


partial

to
provide
that
compensation
for
11


permanent

that
the

can

by
use
of

the
American

as
adopted
by
the

for

partial

in
Code
section

which
states:
“For

Furthermore,

the

is

injury
that
serves
as
the
basis
for
the
employee’s
claim
for
3


compensation
under
Code
chapter
85,
85A,
85B,
or
86.
The
bill
4


also
removes
a
provision
that
an
employer
is
not
liable
for
5


compensating
an
employee’s
preexisting
disability
that
arose
6


out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment
from
a
prior
injury
with
7


the
employer,
to
the
extent
that
the
employee’s
preexisting
8


disability
has
already
been
compensated
under
Code
chapter
9


85,
85A,
85B,
or
86.
The
bill
provides
that
if
an
injured
10


employee
has
a
preexisting
disability
that
was
caused
by
a
11


prior
injury
arising
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment
12


with
the
same
employer,
and
the
preexisting
disability
was
13


compensable
under
Code
section
85.34(2)
as
the
employee’s
14


present
injury,
the
employer
is
liable
for
the
combined
15


disability
that
is
caused
by
the
injuries,
measured
in
relation
16


to
the
employee’s
condition
immediately
prior
to
the
first
17


injury.
In
this
instance,
the
employer’s
liability
for
the
18


combined
disability
shall
be
considered
to
be
already
partially
19


satisfied
to
the
extent
of
the
percentage
of
disability
for
20


which
the
employee
was
previously
compensated
by
the
employer.
21


The
bill
provides,
however,
that
if
an
employer
is
liable
to
22


an
employee
for
a
combined
disability
that
is
payable
under
23


Code
section
85.34(2)(v)
and
the
employee
has
a
preexisting
24


disability
that
causes
the
employee’s
earnings
to
be
less
at
25


the
time
of
the
present
injury
than
if
the
prior
injury
had
not
26


occurred,
the
employer’s
liability
for
the
combined
disability
27


shall
be
considered
to
be
already
partially
satisfied
to
the
28


extent
of
the
percentage
of
disability
for
which
the
employee
29


was
previously
compensated
by
the
employer
minus
the
percentage
30


that
the
employee’s
earnings
are
less
at
the
time
of
the
31


present
injury
than
if
the

had
not
occurred.
32


Additionally,
the
bill
provides
that
a
successor
employer
shall
33


be
considered
to
be
the
same
employer
if
the
employee
became
34


part
of
the

of
the
employee’s
employment.
3


The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.39
concerning
examination
4


of
injured
employees.
The
bill
provides
that
if
an
employee
5


refuses
to
submit
to
an
examination,
the
employee’s
right
to
6


compensation
shall
be
suspended
for
the
period
of
refusal,
7


rather
than
forfeited.
The
bill
maintains
a
similar
provision
8


in
the
Code
that
compensation
shall
not
be
payable
for
the
9


period
of
suspension.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
an
10


employer
is
only
liable
to
reimburse
an
employee
for
the
cost
11


of
an
examination
if
the
injury
for
which
the
employee
is
being
12


examined
is
determined
to
be
compensable
under
Code
chapter
13


85,
85A,
or
85B,
and
an
employer
is
not
liable
for
the
cost
of
14


such
an
examination
if
the
injury
for
which
the
employee
is
15


being
examined
is
determined
not
to
be
a
compensable
injury.
16


The
bill
also
eliminates
a
provision
which
provides
for
the
17


reasonableness
measure
of
a
medical
provider’s
fee
for
an
18


impairment
rating.
19


The
bill
amends
Code
section
85.45(1),
concerning
20


commutation,
by
removing
the
requirement
that
commutation
21


of
future
payments
of

shall
take
place
only
22


upon
application
by
a
party
to
the
commissioner
and
the
23


written
consent
of
all
parties
to
the
commutation
or
partial
24


commutation.
25


The
bill
strikes
Code
section
85.45(3),
which
provides
that
26


the
parties
to
any
commutation
or
partial
commutation
of
future
27


payments
agreed
to

ordered
pursuant

under

The

Code
section
also
provides
that
32


during

of

the
commissioner
shall
33


have
jurisdiction

Under

because
of

and
who

applies

receives
approval
from

shall
be
entitled
to
a

of

in

to

during

program,
which
has
been
recognized
13


by
the
vocational

services
division
of
the

department

The
bill
removes
the
reference
to
15


a
shoulder
injury.
The
bill
strikes
a
provision
relating
to
16


the
vocational

18


The

amends
Code

concerning

19


for

that
occur
outside

to
provide
that
20


the

in
this

The

which
provides

Finally,
