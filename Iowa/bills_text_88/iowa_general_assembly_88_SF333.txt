229A.1
Legislative
findings.



1.


The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
small
but
extremely



dangerous
group
of
sexually
violent
predators
exists
which



is
made
up
of
persons
who
do
not
have
a
mental
disease
or



defect
that
renders
them
appropriate
for
involuntary
treatment



pursuant
to
the
treatment
provisions
for
mentally
ill
persons



under
chapter
229
,
since
that
chapter
is
intended
to
provide



short-term
treatment
to
persons
with
serious
mental
disorders



and
then
return
them
to
the
community.
In
contrast
to
persons



appropriate
for
civil
commitment
under
chapter
229
,
sexually



violent
predators
generally
have
antisocial
personality



features
that
are
unamenable
to
existing
mental
illness



treatment
modalities
and
that
render
them
likely
to
engage
in



sexually
violent
behavior.



2.


The
general
assembly
finds
that
sexually
violent



predators’
likelihood
of
engaging
in
repeat
acts
of
predatory



sexual
violence
is
high
and
that
the
existing
involuntary



commitment
procedure
under
chapter
229
is
inadequate
to
address



the
risk
these
sexually
violent
predators
pose
to
society.



3.


The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
the
prognosis



for
rehabilitating
sexually
violent
predators
in
a
prison



setting
is
poor,
because
the
treatment
needs
of
this
population













Senate
File
333,
p.
10


are
very
long-term,
and
the
treatment
modalities
for
this



population
are
very
different
from
the
traditional
treatment



modalities
available
in
a
prison
setting
or
for
persons



appropriate
for
commitment
under
chapter
229
.



4.


Therefore,
the
general
assembly
finds
that
a
civil



commitment
procedure
for
the
long-term
care
and
treatment
of



the
sexually
violent
predator
is
necessary.
The
procedures



regarding
sexually
violent
predators
should
reflect
legitimate



public
safety
concerns,
while
providing
treatment
services



designed
to
benefit
sexually
violent
predators
who
are
civilly



committed.
The
procedures
should
also
reflect
the
need
to



protect
the
public,
to
respect
the
needs
of
the
victims
of



sexually
violent
offenses,
and
to
encourage
full,
meaningful



participation
of
sexually
violent
predators
in
treatment



programs.
