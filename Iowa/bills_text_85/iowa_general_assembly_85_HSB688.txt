CORRECTIVE

10

regular
12


session.
13


Code
section
422.33(4)(c),

as
a
14


subparagraph
by

Iowa
Acts,
Senate
File
2240,
section
87,
15


is
amended
to
correct
an
internal
reference
to
the
subparagraph
16


itself,
rather
than
to
the
larger
lettered
paragraph,
in
a
17


provision
relating
to
the
calculation
of
the
exemption
amount
18


to
the
alternative

as
enacted
by

20


Acts,
Senate
File
2131,
section

is
amended
to
correctly
21


refer

24


referenced

29


consistent
with

to

regarding

of

authorizes
the
