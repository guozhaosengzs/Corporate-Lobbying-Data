S.F.

Section
1.
Section
39A.1,
subsection
2,
Code
2013,
is
1


amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


2.
The
purpose
of
this
chapter
is
to
identify
actions
which
3


threaten
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
and
to
impose
4


significant
sanctions
upon
persons
who
intentionally
commit
5


those
acts.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
6


offenses
with
the
greatest
potential
to
affect
the
election
7


process
be
vigorously
prosecuted
and
strong
punishment
meted
8


out
through
the
imposition
of
felony
sanctions
which,
as
a
9


consequence,
remove
the
voting
rights
of
the
offenders
until


10


such
rights
are
restored
by
the
governor,
by
the
president
of
11


the
United
States,
or
by
operation
of
law
.
Other
offenses
are
12


still
considered
serious,
but
based
on
the
factual
context
in
13


which
they
arise,
they
may
not
rise
to
the
level
of
offenses
14


to
which
felony
penalties
attach.
The
general
assembly
15


also
recognizes
that
instances
may
arise
in
which
technical
16


infractions
of
chapters
39
through
53
may
occur
which
do
not
17


merit
any
level
of
criminal
sanction.
In
such
instances,
18


administrative
notice
from
the
state
or
county
commissioner
19


of
elections
is
sufficient.
Mandates
or
proscriptions
in
20


chapters
39
through
53
which
are
not
specifically
included
in
21


this
chapter
shall
be
considered
to
be
directive
only,
without
22


criminal
sanction.
