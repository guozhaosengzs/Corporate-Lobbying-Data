If
1


the
person
making
the
independent

or
electioneering
2

uses
funds
exclusively
allocated
from
a
3


segregated
account,
the
person
need
only
disclose
donors
to
4


that
segregated
bank
account.
The
statute
currently
only
5


requires
disclosure
of
donors
if
the
donations
were
given
for
6


the
purpose
of
furthering
the
independent
expenditure.
7


The
bill
requires
that
if
a

making
an
independent
8


expenditure
or
electioneering
communication
receives
a
9


contribution
in
excess
of
$750
from
another
person,
the
person
10


making
the
expenditure
or
communication
must
disclose
on
the

the
name,

13


amounts
of
money
in
the
12
months
prior
to
the
expenditure
or
14


communication
being
made.
15


The
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
68A.507,
which
prohibits
16


a
person
from
making
a
contribution
or
transfer
through
an
17


agent
or
intermediary
for
the
purposes
of
misrepresenting
18


the
source
of
such
contribution
or

The

also
19


prohibits
a
person
from
soliciting
another
person
to
make
such
20


contributions
or
transfers.
21


The
bill
further
establishes
a
severability
clause
for
Code
22


chapter
68A,
providing
that

23


Code
chapter
68A
is
held
invalid,

such
holding
shall

without

Under

serious
misdemeanor
28


is
