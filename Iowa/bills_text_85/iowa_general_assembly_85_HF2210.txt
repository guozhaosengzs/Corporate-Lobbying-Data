Section

NEW
SECTION

262.101
Agriculture
and
urban
1


economies
——
legislative
intent.
2


The
general
assembly
recognizes
that
state
legislative
3


bodies
in
Iowa
and
across
the
country
are
becoming
more
4


urban
and
inclusive
of
more
minority
groups,
and
many
policy
5


discussions
concern
the
differences
between
urban
and
rural
6


interests.
Both
rural
and
urban
districts
stand
to
reap
7


enormous
benefits
from
increased
understanding
of
the
benefits
8


of
agriculture
for
urban
economies
and
the
issues
faced
9


by
rural
constituencies.
Therefore,
the
general
assembly
10


encourages
the
board
of
regents,
through
its
three
state
11


universities,
to
conduct
a
national
urban-ag
academy
once
a
12


year
to
give
state
legislators
in
Iowa
and
around
the
country
13


an
opportunity
to
expand
their
knowledge
of
agricultural
and
14


rural
policy
issues,
so
that,
they
too,
may
engage
in
effective
15


public
policymaking.

Sec.

NEW
SECTION

262.102
National
urban-ag
academy.
17


1.
To
the
extent
practicable
and
contingent
upon
available
18


funding,
the
board
of
regents,
through
the
institutions
under
19


the
board’s
control,
may
annually
conduct
a
national
urban-ag
20


academy
to
update,
inform,
and
enhance
the
knowledge
of
21


state
legislative
policymakers
around
the
country
regarding
22


agricultural
issues
and
concerns.
23


2.
The
purpose
of
the
academy
is
to
create
a
forum
for
24


interactive
problem
solving
and
the
exchange
of
ideas
related
25


to
agriculture,
animal
production,
energy,
conservation,
26


agricultural
education,
and
new
technologies.
The
goal
of
27


the
academy
shall
be
to
bring
urban,
minority,
and
rural
28


legislators
and
other
policymakers
together
with
experts
in
29


agriculture,
rural
development,
and
other
relevant
areas,
to
30


create
opportunities
for
all
legislators
to
be
fully
informed
31


concerning
issues
and
policy
initiatives
relating
to
the
32


agricultural
sector.
