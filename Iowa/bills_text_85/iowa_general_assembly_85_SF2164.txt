with

the

substance
by

members

20


This
bill
makes
several
changes
to
the
individual
income
21


tax.
22


The
bill
eliminates
the
nine
existing
tax
brackets
and
tax
23


rates
and
replaces
them
with
four
tax
brackets
and
tax
rates
24


on

25


1.
From
$0
to

28


4.
From

8.80
percent.
29


The
income
amounts
in

be
adjusted
for
30


inflation
beginning
with
the
2015
tax
year.
31


The
bill
increases
the
net

income
32


tax
will
not
be
imposed
on
a
taxpayer
who
is
under
65
years
of
33


age
to
$24,500
from
$13,500
for

taxpayers,
heads
of
34


household,
or
surviving
spouses,
and
to
$20,000
from
$9,000

for
a
single
taxpayer.
The
bill
also
amends
the
alternate
1


tax
calculation
for
a
married
person,
head
of
household,
or
2


surviving
spouse
under
the
age
of
65
so
that
it
is
calculated
3


using
the
amount
of
net
income
in
excess
of
$24,500
instead
4


of
the
amount
of
income
in
excess
of
$13,500.
By
operation
5


of
law
and
under
the
bill,
a
single
taxpayer
under
65
years
6


of
age
will
not
be
required
to
make
and
file
a
tax
return
if
7


the
taxpayer’s
net
income
is
$20,000
or
less,
and
a
married
8


taxpayer,
head
of
household,
or
surviving
spouse
will
not
be
9


required
to
make
and
file
a
tax
return
if
the
taxpayer’s
net
10


income
is
$24,500
or
less.
11


The
bill
eliminates
the
deduction
for
federal
income
taxes
12


paid
and
the
inclusion
of
federal
income
tax
refunds
received
13


except
for
a
one-year
phase-out
in
2014,
for
taxes
paid
or
14


refunds
received
in
that
year
that
relate
to
a
prior
tax
year.
15


The
bill
increases
the
personal
exemption
credit
for
a
16


dependent
to
$500
from
$40.
17


Finally,
the
bill
provides
an
individual
income
tax
18


exemption
from
the
computation
of
net
income
for
the
first
19


$1,000
of
wages
received
by
a
“secondary
wage
earner”,
which
is
20


defined
in
the
bill
to
be
a
married
person
who,
with
respect
to
21


a
tax
year,
received
a
lower
amount
of
wages
than
the
person’s
22


spouse.
In
the
event
each
spouse
received
the
same
amount
of
23


wages
during
the
tax
year,
both
spouses
will
be
considered
an
24


“identical
wage
earner”
and
each
will
be
eligible
to
exempt
the
25


first
$500
of
wages
received.
26


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
27


retroactively
to
January
1,
2014,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
28


or
after
that
date.
