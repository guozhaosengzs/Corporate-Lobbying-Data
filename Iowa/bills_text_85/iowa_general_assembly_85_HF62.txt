EXPLANATION
2


Under
current
law,
a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
care
3


facility
or
hospital
who
makes
application
for
an
absentee
4


ballot
is,
in
most
circumstances,
delivered
the
ballot
by
5


two
special
precinct
election
officials
appointed
by
the
6


county
commissioner
of
elections.
This
bill
requires
that
7


form
applications
for
an
absentee
ballot
include
certain
8


questions
related
to
whether
the
applicant
is
a
resident
9


or
patient
in
a
health
care
facility
or
hospital,
military
10


veteran
status,
and
the
applicant’s
preferred
method
of
ballot
11


delivery
if
the
applicant
is
such
a
resident
or
patient
and
is
12


a
military
veteran.
The
bill
provides
that,
upon
receipt
of
an
13


application
for
an
absentee
ballot
by
a
resident
of
a
health
14


care
facility
or
hospital
who
is
also
a
military
veteran,
the
15


commissioner
shall
have
the
absentee
ballot
delivered
by
mail
16


if
the
applicant
so
requests.
The
bill
requires
the
department
17


of
veterans
affairs
to
assist
the
county
commissioners
of
18


elections
by
providing
eligibility
determinations
and
other
19


assistance
requested
by
the
county
commissioners.
20


Finally,
the
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
related
to
21


certain
letter
notifications
sent
by
the
commissioner
to
an
22


applicant
who
is
a
resident
of
a
hospital
or
health
care
23


facility.
