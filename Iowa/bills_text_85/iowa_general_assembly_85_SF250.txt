HIV-related
tests,
including
a
provision
that
allows
a
legal
1


guardian
to
provide
consent
if
the
individual
who
is
the
2


subject
of
the
test
is
unable
to
do
so.
The
bill
provides
that,
3


unless
a
minor
is
unable
to
provide
consent,
only
the
minor’s
4


consent
is
required
to
undergo
the
HIV-related
test
and
the
5


consent
of
the
minor’s
legal
guardian
is
not
required.
6


The
law
also
specifies
who
is
required
to
be
informed
of
7


HIV-related
confirmed
positive
test
results.
The
law
provides
8


that
if
the
legal
guardian
of
the
individual
who
is
the
subject
9


of
the
test
provided
consent
to
the
testing,
the
legal
guardian
10


is
to
be
informed
of
the
positive
test
results
and
counseling
11


is
to
be
provided
to
the
legal
guardian.
The
bill
clarifies
12


that
this
informing
of
the
legal
guardian
only
applies
when
13


the
legal
guardian
provided
consent
because
the
individual
was
14


unable
to
do
so.
15


The
law
provides
that
a
person
may
apply
for
voluntary
16


treatment,
contraceptive
services,
or
screening
or
treatment
17


for
HIV
infection
and
other
sexually
transmitted
diseases
18


directly
to
a
licensed
physician
and
surgeon,
an
osteopathic
19


physician
and
surgeon,
or
a
family
planning
clinic.
The
minor
20


is
to
be
informed
that
the
minor’s
legal
guardian
is
required
21


to
be
informed
of
a
positive
HIV-related
test
result.
The
bill
22


amends
this
provision
to
instead
provide
that
the
consent
of
a
23


minor’s
legal
guardian
is
not
required
for
the
minor
to
receive
24


services,
screening,
or
treatment,
and
that
instead
the
minor
25


applying
for
services,
screening,
or
treatment
is
required
to
26


give
written
consent
to
receive
the
services,
screening,
or
27


treatment.
The
bill
provides
that
the
minor’s
consent
is
not
28


subject
to
later
disaffirmance
by
reason
of
minority.
Under
29


the
bill,
unless
a
minor
consents
to
inform
the
minor’s
legal
30


guardian
upon
confirmation
of
a
positive
HIV-related
test
31


result,
the
minor’s
legal
guardian
shall
not
be
informed
by
32


the
testing
facility.
The
bill
retains
the
existing
provision
33


that
requires
testing
facilities
where
minors
are
tested
to
34


have
a
program
available
to
assist
minors
and
legal
guardians

with
the
notification
process,
but
under
the
bill
this
would
1


only
apply
if
the
minor
consented
to
notification
of
the
2


minor’s
legal
guardian.
Under
the
law,
testing
facilities
3


which
are
precluded
by
federal
statute,
regulation,
or
centers
4


for
disease
control
and
prevention
guidelines
from
informing
5


a
minor’s
legal
guardian
are
also
exempt
under
state
law
from
6


notifying
a
minor’s
legal
guardian.
In
addition,
under
the
7


bill,
these
entities
are
also
exempt
from
informing
the
minor
8


of
the
option
to
consent
to
notification
of
the
minor’s
legal
9


guardian
since
the
entities
are
already
prohibited
from
the
10


resulting
notification.
