personal
property
owned
by
a
decedent
and
located
in
this
state
1


regardless
of
whether
the
decedent
is
domiciled
in
this
state,
2


and
intangible
personal
property
owned
by
a
decedent
domiciled
3


in
this
state
regardless
of
where
the
property
is
located
(Code
4


section
450.2).
The
value
of
the
estate
is
determined
after
5


liabilities
are
subtracted
from
the
estate’s
gross
value
(Code
6


section
450.12).
No
tax
is
due

decedent
is
less
than
$25,000
(Code
section

13


great-grandparent,
other
lineal

stepchildren,
grandchildren,
great-grandchildren,
and
other
15


lineal
descendants
(Code
sections
450.9
and
450.10(6)).
A
16


stepchild
is
defined
to
mean
the
child
of
an
individual
who
was
17


married
to
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
the
decedent’s
death
18


or
the
child
of
a
person
to
whom
the
decedent
was
married
19


and
who
died
during
the
marriage
(Code
section
450.1(1)).
20


For
individuals,
two
tax
rate
schedules
apply
based
on
the
21


beneficiary’s
degree
of
relationship
to
the
decedent.
One
22


schedule
applies
to
property
passing
to
the
decedent’s
brother
23


or
sister
or
son-in-law
or
daughter-in-law.
Under
this
24


schedule,
the
tax
rate
increases
from
5
percent
for
a
share
25


amount
equaling
up
to
$12,500
to
10
percent
for
that
portion
of
26


a
share
amount
in
excess
of
$150,000
(Code
section
450.10(1)).
27


Another
schedule
applies
to
property
passing
to
all
other
28


individuals,
such
as
an
uncle
or
aunt,
nephew
or
niece,
cousin,
29


or
anyone
else
(e.g.,
a
neighbor).
Under
this
schedule,
the
30


tax
rate
increases
from
10
percent
for
a
share
amount
up
to
31


$50,000
to
15
percent
for
that
portion
of
a
share
amount
in
32


excess
of
$100,000
(Code
section
450.10(2)).

bill
provides
that
the

The

with

rate
of

when

individual’s
share

exceeds
