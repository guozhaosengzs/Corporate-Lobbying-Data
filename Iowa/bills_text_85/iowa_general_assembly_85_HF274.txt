requires
an
14


employer
to
provide
written
information
about
the
state’s
15


workers’
compensation
laws
to
an
employee
upon
receiving
16


notification
that
the
employee
has
suffered
a
work-related
17


injury.
The
employer
has
the
right
to
predesignate
a
licensed
18


physician
to
treat
the
injury
and
make
necessary
referrals
and
19


may
predesignate
a
physician
listed
on
the
state
registry
of
20


workplace
injury
care
providers.
If
the
employer
does
not
21


predesignate
a
treating
physician,
the
employee
may
designate
a
22


physician
of
the
employee’s
choosing
to
provide
the
treatment.
23


The
physician
predesignated
by
the
employer
or
designated
24


by
the
employee
is
required
to
provide
ongoing
written
25


documentation

is
dissatisfied
with
the
care
2


of
a
treating
physician
predesignated
or
designated
by
the
3


other
party
or
with
any
referral
made
by
that
physician,
the
4


employer
and
employee
may
mutually
agree
to
alternate
care.
If
5


they
cannot
agree
on
alternate
care,
either
party
may
notify
6


an
insurance
claims
specialist
within
the
division
of
workers’
7


compensation,
who
shall,
within
five
working
days,
schedule
8


a
conference
between
the
parties
to
review
the
basis
for
9


dissatisfaction
and
provide
an
advisory
opinion
to
resolve
the
10


dispute.
If
the
parties
still
cannot
agree
on
alternate
care
11


after
this
conference,
the
workers’
compensation
commissioner
12


may,
upon
application
and
reasonable
proof
of
the
necessity,
13


allow
and
order
alternate
care.
14


The
employee
is
responsible
to
make
the
application
for
15


alternate
care
and
to
provide
such
reasonable
proof
to
the
16


commissioner
if
the
employer
provided
written

17

of
18


notification
of

guidelines.
25


The
employer
is
responsible
for
making
the

for
26


alternate

and
providing
reasonable
proof
if
the
employer
27


and
predesignated
treating
physician
did
not
act
as
described
28


above
or
if
the
employee
designated
the
treating
physician
to
29


treat
the
work
injury.
30


The
commissioner
is
not
bound
by
the
advisory
opinion
of
31


the
claims
specialist
and
must
conduct
a
hearing
and
issue
32


a
decision
within
10
days
of
receipt
of

that
the
employer
obtains
an
evaluation
8


of
an

by
a
physician
chosen
by
9


the

if
