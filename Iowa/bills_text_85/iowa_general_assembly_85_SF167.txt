is
imposed,
the
8


supreme
court
shall
automatically
review
the
judgment
and

case
shall
be
de

The

A
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
a
judgment
and
sentence
12


imposing
the
punishment
of
death
has
priority
over
all
other
13


criminal
and
other
actions
pending
before
the
supreme
court.
14


3.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
and
judgment,
15


and
shall
separately
review
the
sentencing
proceeding.
Upon
16


determining
that
errors
did
not
occur
at
the
trial
requiring
17


reversal
or
modification
of
the
judgment,
the
supreme
court
18


shall
proceed
to
determine
if
the
sentence
of
death
is
lawfully
19


imposed.
In
its
review
of
the
sentencing
proceeding
the
20


supreme
court
shall
determine
all
of
the
following:
21


a.
Whether
the
sentence
of
death
was
imposed
capriciously
or
22


under
the
influence
of
prejudice
or
other
arbitrary
factor.
23


b.
Whether
the
special
verdicts
returned
under
section
24


901.11
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
25


c.
Whether
the
sentence
of
death
is
excessive
or
26


disproportionate
to
the
penalty
imposed
in
similar
cases,
27


considering
both
the
crime
and
the
defendant.
28


4.
If
the
supreme
court
determines
that
the
sentence
of
29


death
was
not
lawfully
imposed,
the
court
shall
set
aside
the
30


sentence
and
shall
remand
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
a
31


second
sentencing
proceeding
to
determine
if
the
imposition
of
32


death
is
warranted.

the
defendant
at
the

of
the
murder.
22


(3)

wrongfulness
23


of
the
defendant’s
conduct
and
to
conform
that
conduct
to
the
24


requirements
of
law
was
significantly
impaired
as
a
result
of
a
25


mental
disease
or
defect
or
intellectual
disability,
but
not
to
26


a
degree
sufficient
to
constitute
a

has
no
significant
history
of
prior
adult
28


criminal

EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
amends
the
Iowa
criminal
code
to
provide
for
19


punishment
by
death
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
kidnapping,
20


and
sexual
abuse
committed
with
respect
to
the
same
victim
21


who
is
a
minor
if
the
trial
jury,
or
the
judge
if
there
22


is
no
jury,
makes
specific
findings
and
whether
the
jury
23


believes
the
defendant
should
be
put
to
death
in
a
separate
24


penalty
proceeding
held
after
the
close
of
the
initial
trial
25


proceeding.
Under
the
bill,
a
death
sentence
could
be
imposed
26


if
the
murder
would
constitute
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
27


the
state
pleads
and
proves
the
defendant
also
kidnapped
and
28


committed
sexual
abuse
against
the
murder
victim
who
was
a
29


minor.
30


If
a
person
is
indigent
and
is
charged
with
capital
murder,
31


payment
of
costs
for
two
attorneys
is
authorized.
The
supreme
32


court
is
required
to
establish
standards
for
the
competency
of
33


counsel
in
death
penalty
cases.
The
state
public
defender
is
34


charged
with
establishing
teams
of
qualified
lead
and
cocounsel

for
death
penalty
cases,
as
well
as
conducting
or
sponsoring
1


specialized
training
programs
for
attorneys
representing
2


persons
who
may
be
executed.
3


If
such
a
case
proceeds
to
trial
and
a
notice
of
intent
to
4


seek
the
death
penalty
has
been
filed,
in
addition
to
any
other
5


defenses
which
may
be
presented
to
the
charge,
the
defendant
6


may
raise
the
issue
of
intellectual
disability
during
the
time
7


of
filing
pretrial
motions,
and
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
8


a
rebuttable
presumption
of
intellectual
disability
if
the
9


defendant
establishes
that
the
defendant
has
an
intelligence
10


quotient
of
70
or
below.
11


Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
12


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
13


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the
14


race,
color,
religious
beliefs,
national
origin,
or
sex
of
15


the
defendant
or
of
any
victim
is
not
to
be
considered.
The
16


supreme
court
shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
17


death
sentences
imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
18


imposed
under
the
influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
19


available
to
litigants.
20


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
21


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
22


a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
23


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
a
24


reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances
that
25


may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
sentenced
26


to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
consider
27


include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
influence
28


of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
age
of
29


the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
the
30


wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
not
31


to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
no
32


significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
under
33


extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
the
34


murder,
kidnapping,
and
sexual
abuse;
and
the
defendant’s

S.F.
167


character
or
record
or
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
The
1


sentencing
proceeding
is
conducted
separately
from
the
finding
2


of
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
same
trier
of
fact.
3


For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
4


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
5


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
6


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
7


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
8


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.
Evidence
of
certain
9


juvenile
delinquency
adjudications
is
not
admissible
in
any
10


proceeding
to
determine
the
sentence.
If
the
jury
fails
to
11


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
12


penalty
would
be
life
imprisonment.
13


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
14


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
15


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
16


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
17


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
18


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
19


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
20


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the
supreme
21


court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
22


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
23


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
24


witnessing
of
executions.
25


The
bill
further
provides
that
in
order
to
receive
a
sentence
26


of
death,
the
defendant
must
be
at
least
18
years
of
age
at
27


the
time
the
offense
is
committed,
must
not
be
mentally
ill
or
28


intellectually
disabled,
and
must
have
been
a
major
participant
29


in
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
must
have
shown
a
manifest
30


indifference
to
human
life.
31


A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
32


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
33


the
person
is
no
longer
pregnant.
A
procedure
is
also
provided
34


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane

An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or
2


assist
in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
3


for
refusing
to
participate.
4


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
5


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
6


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
7


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
8


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
9


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
10


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
11


The
bill
contains
severability
provisions
and
takes
effect
12


January
1,
2014,
and
applies
only
to
offenses
committed
on
or
13


after
that
date.
