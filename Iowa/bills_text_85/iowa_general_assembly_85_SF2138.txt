EXPLANATION
10


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
relates
to
property
taxes
of
veterans
by
providing
13


an
additional
homestead
credit
for
certain
disabled
veterans
14


and
by
modifying
the
military
service
property
tax
exemption.
15


The
disabled
veterans
tax
credit
under
Code
section
425.15
16


provides
a
credit
on
the
homestead
of
an
eligible
veteran
17


who
acquired
the
homestead
under
specified
federal
programs
18


in
an
amount
equal
to
the
entire
amount
of
the
tax
levied
19


on
the
homestead.
The
bill
modifies
the
qualifications
for
20


the
disabled
veterans
tax
credit
by
adding
the
following
21


to
the
list
of
veterans
who
are
eligible
for
the
credit:
22


(1)
a
veteran
as

in
Code
section

28


service-connected
disability
rating
of
100
percent
as
certified
29


by

The

30


also
strikes

32


Under

increases
the
3


exemption
amount
for
all
eligible

percent
of
the

taxable
value
of
the
veteran’s
property
or
$15,000,
whichever
