EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
contains
provisions
concerning
the
movement
of
18


vehicles
of
excessive
size
and
weight
on
Iowa
roads.
19


Code
section
321.473
is
amended
by
striking
provisions
20


relating
to
annual
permits
for
the
operation
of
compact
rubbish
21


vehicles,
which
are
moved
to
new
Code
section
321E.30.
22


Code
section
321E.1
is
amended
to
provide
that
if
a
vehicle
23


permitted
to
transport
indivisible
loads
has
a
retractable
body
24


extension,
the
extension
must
be
reduced
to
legal
dimensions
25


unless
the
vehicle
is
loaded
and
the
extension
is
in
use.
The
26


bill
allows
persons
requesting
permits
to
do
so
in
person,
27


through
the
internet,
by
facsimile
machine,
or
by
telephone.
28


Currently,
Code
section
321E.2
allows
the
department
of
29


transportation
to
issue
all-systems
permits
for
movements
on
30


all
highways
or
streets
under
the
jurisdiction
of
either
the
31


state
or
local
authorities
that
have
indicated
in
writing
those
32


streets
or
highways
for
which
an
all-systems
permit
is
not
33


valid.
Under
the
bill,
at
the
request
of
a
local
authority,
34


the
department
shall
also
issue
other
types
of
permits
for

The
bill
stipulates
that
3


“in

includes
electronic
communication.
4


Code
section
321E.7,
which
relates
to
load
limits
per
axle,
5


is
amended
by
making
technical
revisions
to
existing
language
6


and
by
including
the
axle
and
gross
weight
limitations
for
raw
7


milk
transporters
and
compact
rubbish
vehicles
by
reference
8


to
those
provisions,
which
are
found
elsewhere
in
the
Code
9


chapter.
10


Code
section
321E.8,
which
provides
for
the
issuance
of
11


annual
permits,
is
amended
to
provide
that
certain
commercial
12


vehicles
other
than
special
trucks,
which
are
currently
13


allowed
to
operate
at
weight
limits
of
up
to
90,000
pounds
14


with
six
axles,
and
up
to
96,500
pounds
with
seven
axles,
are
15


exempt
from
permitting
requirements
based
on
weight
in
excess
16


of
80,000
pounds.
Currently,
cranes
that
are
used
in
the
17


construction
of
alternative
energy
facilities
and
which
exceed
18


the
20,000
weight
limit
established
under
Code
chapter
321
on
19


any
one
axle
may
be
moved
with
approval
of
the
permit-issuing
20


authority,
without
the
requirement
of
an
annual
permit.
The
21


bill
allows
such
cranes
to
exceed
the
24,000
pound
weight
limit
22


established
under
Code
section
321E.7
for
any
one
axle.
The
23


exemption
is
also
allowed
for
such
cranes
operating
under
a
24


single-trip
permit.
25


Currently,
Code
section
321E.9
provides
that
a
vehicle
26


with
an
indivisible
load,
having
an
overall
width
of
40
feet,
27


overall
length
of
120
feet,
or
a
total
gross
weight
of
100,000
28


pounds
may
be
moved
under
a
single-trip
permit
provided
the
29


gross
weight
on
any
one
axle
does
not
exceed
maximum
weight
30


limits.
The
height
of
vehicles
and
loads
is
currently
limited
31


by
the
height
of
underpasses,
bridges,
power
lines,
and
other
32


restrictions
on
the
route
specified
in
the
permit.
The
bill
33


strikes
those
provisions
and
instead
provides
that
maximum
34


height,
width,
length,
and
weight
of
vehicles
and
loads

4


regarding
the

based
on

The

to
limit
the
maximum
9


height
allowed
for
a
vehicle
with
an
indivisible

and
are
moved
18


from

The
bill
amends
the
Code

by
limiting
its
applicability
to
semitrailers
and

Current
requirements
for

of

for

24


Code

321E.11
provides
for

under
permit
25


during
daylight
hours,
with
certain
exceptions,
and
on

holidays.
The
Code
section
is

that
a

an
overall
