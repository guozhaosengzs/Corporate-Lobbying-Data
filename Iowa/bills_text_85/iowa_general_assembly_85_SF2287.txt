EXPLANATION
14


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
15


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
16


This
bill
provides
for
expanded
highway
use
of
all-terrain
17


vehicles.
18


Currently,
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
19


is
permitted
if
the
operation
is
between
sunrise
and
sunset
and
20


is
incidental
to
the
vehicle’s
use
for
agricultural
purposes;
21


if
the
operation
is
incidental
to
land
surveying;
if
the
22


operation
is
by
an
employee
or
agent
of
a
political
subdivision
23


or
public
utility
for
the
purpose
of
construction
or
24


maintenance
on
or
adjacent
to
the
highway;
or
if
the
operation
25


is
for
the
purpose
of
mowing,
installing
approved
trail
26


signs,
or
providing
maintenance
on
a
designated
snowmobile
27


or
all-terrain
vehicle
trail.
The
operator
is
required
to
28


have
a
valid
driver’s
license,
and
a
35-mile-per-hour
speed
29


restriction
applies.
These
provisions
for
the
operation
of
30


all-terrain
vehicles
on
a
highway
for
limited
purposes
are
not
31


changed
under
the
bill.
32


The
bill
provides
that
an
all-terrain
vehicle
designed
to
33


travel
on
four
or
more
wheels
may
be
operated
on
secondary
34


roads,
but
not
on
primary
highways,
except
to
cross

primary
highway,
and
not
on
highways
within
the
corporate
1


limits
of
a
city
except
where
all-terrain
vehicles
are
2


permitted
by
ordinance.
A
county
may,
by
ordinance,
prohibit
3


the
use
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
county
roads,
and
a
city
may
4


authorize
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
5


under
the
city’s
jurisdiction
other
than
municipal
extensions
6


of
primary
highways.
The
bill
strikes
current
provisions
in
7


Code
chapter
321I
that
allow
cities
and
counties
to
designate
8


roads
under
their
jurisdiction
for
the
operation
of
all-terrain
9


vehicles.
10


The
bill
states
that
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
11


vehicle
on
a
highway
under
the
new
provisions
must
be
at
12


least
16
years
of
age
and
have
a
valid
driver’s
license
other
13


than
a
license
valid
only
for
the
operation
of
a
motorized
14


bicycle.
The
all-terrain
vehicle
must
be
registered
with
the
15


department
of
natural
resources.
Iowa
motor
vehicle
laws
apply
16


to
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
except
17


those
equipment
provisions
which
by
their
nature
can
have
no
18


practical
application.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
operator
19


of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
must
carry
proof
of
motor
vehicle
20


financial
liability
coverage,
and
the
all-terrain
vehicle
must
21


meet
requirements
for
headlamps,
rear
lamps,
and
turn
signals.
22


Current
speed
limits
apply
to
all-terrain
vehicles
operated
23


on
a
highway,
except
that
an
all-terrain
vehicle
may
not
be
24


operated
at
a
speed
exceeding
35
miles
per
hour.
25


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
restrictions
on
the
26


operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
a
highway
is
a
simple
27


misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
28


The
definition
of
“all-terrain
vehicle”,
for
purposes
of
29


Code
chapter
321,
includes
off-road
utility
vehicles.
The
30


bill
revises
the
definition
of
“off-road
utility
vehicle”,
31


for
purposes
of
Code
chapter
321,
to
match
the
definition
32


under
Code
chapter
321I,
which
encompasses
larger
vehicles.
33


However,
the
bill
specifies
that
for
purposes
of
Code
chapter
34


321,
“off-road
utility
vehicle”
does
not
include
vehicles
