1.
Findings
and
intent.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
9


Iowa
school
districts
need
to
be
more
competitive
in
recruiting
10


and
retaining
talented
teachers
to
teach
in
high-need
schools.
11


Therefore,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
12


encourage
school
districts
to
provide
supplemental
assistance
13


to
teachers
to
teach
in
high-need
schools.
This
section
14


provides
for
state
assistance
to
allow
school

to
15


provide
supplemental

to
motivate
teachers
to

Subject
to
an

of
sufficient

by
the
general

the

shall
do
the
following:
20


a.
Collect
relevant

and
establish
a

of
high-need
21


schools
eligible
for
state

The
22


department
shall
establish
a

and
criteria
to
determine
23


which
schools
are
placed
on
the
list
and
the

shall
24


revise
the

annually.
Criteria
for
the
determination
of
25


which
high-need

the
list
shall
be

based
upon
factors
that
include
but

not
limited
to
the
27


socioeconomic
status
of
the
students
enrolled
in
the
school,
28

body
who
are
limited
29


English
proficient
students,
student
academic
growth,

The

which
a

needed
per

to
provide
an
incentive
for
a

A

a
process
for

16


moneys,
the

must
give
priority
to
school
districts
17


with
enrollments
of
fewer
than
600

18


employed
by
an

established
19


by
a

if
the

enter
20


into

25


The
