This

provides
for
the
establishment

The
bill
creates
new
Code
chapter
514M,
which
provides
for
9


the
establishment
of
an
Iowa
health
insurance
marketplace,
in
10


place
of
the
federal-state
partnership
exchange
created
and
11


fully
operational
as

to
facilitate
the
12


sale
and
purchase
of

state
by
13


qualified
individuals
in
the
individual
market
and
by
qualified
14


small
employers
in
the
small
group
market.
The
intent
of
15


establishing
such
a
marketplace
is
to
reduce
the
number
of
16


uninsured
individuals
in
this
state,
provide
a
transparent
17


marketplace
and
consumer
education,
and
assist
individuals

federal

programs,
premium

assistance
tax
credits,
and
cost-sharing
reductions.

a

component
of
the

is
an

that
employs
an

average

not
more
than
50
employees
during
24


the
preceding
calendar
year

elects
to
make
its

employees,
and
at
the
employer’s
option,
some
or
all
of
its
26


part-time
employees,
eligible
for
one
or
more
qualified
health
27


plans
offered
through
the
small
business
health
options
program
28


component
of
the
marketplace.
A
qualified
employer
must
29


either
have
its
principal
place
of
business
in
this
state
and
30


elect
to
provide
health
coverage
through
the
marketplace
to
31


all
of
its
eligible
employees
wherever
employed,
or
elect
to
32
