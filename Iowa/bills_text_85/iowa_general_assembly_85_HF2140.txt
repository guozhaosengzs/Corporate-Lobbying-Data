EXPLANATION
16


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
17


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
continues
to
direct
the
state
board
of
education
19


to
adopt
sets
of
academic
and
assessment
standards,
but
amends
20


the
terms
used
to
describe
the
standards
and
makes
use
of
the
21


academic
standards
by
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
22


schools
voluntary.
The
bill
also
strikes
language
that
23


authorizes
the
state
board
to
amend
the
core
content
standards
24


as
changes
in
federal
law
or
regulation
occur.
25


The
bill
replaces
the
terms
“core
curriculum”,
“Iowa
26


core
curriculum”,
and
“Iowa
common
core”,
which
were
used
to
27


describe
the
academic
standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
28


with
the
term
“Iowa
content
standards”.
Also,
provisions
29


directing
school
districts
to
cooperate
with
each
eighth
grade
30


student
on
a
core
curriculum
plan
to
meet
core
curriculum
31


requirements
are
amended
to
replace
“core
curriculum
plan”
32


with
“graduation
plan”
and
“core
curriculum
requirements”
33


with
“high
school
graduation
requirements”.
The
term
“core
34


content
standards”,
which
was
used
to
describe
the
assessment

standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
is
replaced
with

term

The
assessment
standards
will

remain
applicable
to
all
students
in
kindergarten
through

grade

in
every

district
and

are
