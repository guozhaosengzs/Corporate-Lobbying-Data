REINSTATEMENT
REQUIREMENTS.
Currently,
Code
section
321J.17
14


contains
provisions
relating
to
reinstatement
of
a
person’s
15


driver’s
license
or
nonresident
operating
privileges
after
16


revocation
for
any
OWI
offense
under
Code
chapter
321J
(based
17


on
either
administrative
or
criminal
action).
The
person
must
18


pay
a
civil
penalty
fine,
present
proof
of
completion
of
a
19


course
for
drinking
drivers
and
a
substance
abuse
evaluation
20


and
treatment,
and
if
applicable,
present
proof
of
financial
21


responsibility.
In
addition,
following
a
second
or
subsequent
22


license
revocation,
a
person
applying
for
reinstatement
must
23


install
a
department-approved
ignition
interlock
device
on
all
24


vehicles
owned
or
operated
by
the
person
for
one
year,
unless
a
25


longer
period
of
time
is
otherwise
required.
26


The
bill
retains
the
current
requirements
for
reinstatement,
27


but
in
regard
to
ignition
interlock
devices,
requires
all
28


persons
(not
just
repeat
offenders)
applying
for
reinstatement
29


to
install
an
ignition
interlock
device
on
all
vehicles
owned
30


or

by
the

for
the
following
periods
of
time
31


depending
on
the
nature
of
the
offense:
for
