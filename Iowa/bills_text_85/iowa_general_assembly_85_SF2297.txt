with
a
contagious
or
infectious


disease
and
exposes
an
uninfected
person
to

with
the
intent
that
the
uninfected
person

p.

contract
the
contagious
or

disease,
and
the
conduct


results
in

infected
with
the


contagious
or
infectious
disease.


2.
A
person
commits
a
class
“D”
felony

infected
with
a
contagious

in
the
uninfected
person

3.

person
commits
a
class
“D”
felony
when
the

person
is
infected
with
a
contagious
or
infectious


disease
and
exposes
an
uninfected
person
to
the
contagious


or
infectious
disease
acting
with
a
reckless
disregard
as
to


whether
the
uninfected
person
contracts
the

results
in
the
uninfected


person
becoming
infected
with

or
infectious


disease
and
exposes
an
uninfected
person
to
the
contagious

acting
with
a
reckless
disregard
as
to


whether
the
uninfected
person
contracts
the
contagious
or


infectious
disease,
but
the
conduct
does
not
result
in
the


uninfected
person
becoming
infected
with
the
contagious
or


infectious
disease.


5.
The
act
of
becoming
pregnant
while

Evidence
that
a
person
knows
the
person
is
infected
with


a
contagious
or
infectious
disease
and
has
engaged
in
conduct


that
exposes
others
to
the
contagious
or
infectious
disease,


regardless
of
the
frequency
of
the
conduct,
is
insufficient


on
its
own
to
prove
the
intent
to
transmit
the
contagious
or


infectious
disease.


7.
A
person
does
not
act
with
the

required

required


pursuant

the
person
has
a
contagious


or
infectious
disease
and
offers
to
take
practical
means

to
prevent
transmission
but
that
offer
is
rejected
by
the


uninfected
person
subsequently
exposed
to
the
infectious
or


contagious
disease.


8.
It
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
charge
under
this


section
if

contagious
or
infectious


disease
knew
that
the
infected
person
was
infected
with
the


contagious
or
infectious

at
the
time
of
the
exposure


and
consented
to
exposure
with
that
knowledge.
