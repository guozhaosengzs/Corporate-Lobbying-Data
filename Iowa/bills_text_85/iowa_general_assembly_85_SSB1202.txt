EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
relates
to
the
manner
in
which
the
property
of
14


telecommunications
companies
is
assessed
and
taxed.
15


The
assessment
provisions
of
current
Code
section
16


433.4
provide
that
in
ascertaining
the
actual
value
of
17


telecommunications
company
property
the
director
of
revenue
18


shall
include
all
property
of
every
kind
and
character
19


whatsoever,
real,
personal,
or
mixed,
used
by
the
company
in
20


the
transaction
of
telegraph
and
telephone
business.
21


The
bill
strikes
the
provisions
that
included
all
kinds
and
22


character
of
property
in
the
determination
of
actual
value
23


of
a
company’s
property.
Instead,
the
bill
provides
that
24


for
assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2014,
25


a
company’s
property,
excluding
central
office
equipment
and
26


qualified
telephone
company
property,
both
as
defined
in
the
27


bill,
shall
be
subject
to
assessment
and
taxation
under
Code
28


chapter
433
by
the
director
of
revenue
in
the
same
manner
as
29


property
assessed
and
taxed
as
commercial
property.
The
bill
30


provides,
however,
that
for
assessment
years
beginning
on
or
31


after
January
1,
2014,
the
director
of
revenue
shall
include
as
32


part
of
the
actual
value
so
determined
for
that
assessment
year
33


a
specified
amount
of
actual
value
of
the
company’s
qualified
34


telephone
company
property.
