Code

currently
requires
a
city
having
a

population
of
8,000
or
more
according
to
the
federal
census
10


conducted
in
1980
and

fire
department
or
a
paid
11


police
department,
to
appoint
a
civil

commission.
Code

chapter

also
establishes
several
other
powers
and
duties
of
13


cities
based
on
population
as
determined
by
the
federal

14


conducted

15


This
bill
requires
the
most
recent
decennial
federal
census
16


to
be
used
in
determining
the
population
of
a
city.
17


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code

The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
19


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
20


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
21


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
22


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
23


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
