The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
relates
to
the
state
sales
and
use
taxes,
the
13


natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund,
and
the
14


state

DIVISION
I
——
SALES
AND
USE
TAXES.
Division
I
relates
16


to
state
sales
and
use
taxes
and
to
an
amendment
to
the
Iowa
17


Constitution
ratified
on
November
2,
2010,
which
created
a
18


natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
(fund)
19


and
dedicated
a
portion
of
state
revenues
to
the
fund
for
20


the
purposes
of
protecting
and
enhancing
water
quality
and
21


natural
areas
in
the
state
including
parks,
trails,
and
fish
22


and
wildlife
habitat,
and
conserving
agricultural
soils
in
23


the
state
(Article
VII,
section
10).
The
fund
is
codified
in
24


Code
section
461.31.
Pursuant
to
the
amendment,
the
amount
25


credited
to
the
fund
will
be
equal
to
the
amount
generated
26


by
an
increase
in
the
state
sales
tax
rate
occurring
after
27


the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
but
shall
28


not
exceed
the
amount
that
a
state
sales
tax
rate
of
0.375
29


percent
would
generate.
The
state
sales
tax
rate
has
not
30


been
increased
since
the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
31


amendment,
so
no
amounts
have
been
credited
to
the
fund.
The
32


division
increases
the
sales
tax
rate
and
the
use
tax
rate
33


from
6
percent
to
6.125
percent
on
January
1,
2016,
from
6.125
34


percent
to
6.25
percent
on
January

2017,

to

revenue
as

prior
to
the

tax
rate

——
INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAXES.
Division
II
8


relates
to
the
individual
income
tax.
The
division
increases
9


the
amount
of
net
income
at
which
the
individual
income
tax
10


will
not
be
imposed
on
a
taxpayer
who
is
under
65
years
of
11


age.
Under
current
law,
the
individual
income
tax
is
not
12


imposed
if
net
income
does
not
exceed
$13,500
in
the
case
of
13


married
persons
filing
a
joint
or
separate
return,
a
head
of
14


household,
or
a
surviving
spouse,
or
$9,000
in
the
case
of
15


all
other
taxpayers.
The
division
increases
those
amounts
to
16


$24,750
or
$20,250,
respectively,
for
tax
year
2016;
$30,250

year

$30,700,
respectively,
for
tax
year
2018,
and
for
each
tax
year
19


thereafter.

conforming
amendment
to
the
calculation
21


of
the
alternate
tax
in

section
422.5(3)(b)
for
married
22


persons
filing
a
