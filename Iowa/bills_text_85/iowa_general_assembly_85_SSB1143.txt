EXPLANATION
2


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
a
number
of
provisions
relating
3


to
the
functions
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
4


stewardship.
5


DIVISION
I
——
SOIL
AND
WATER
CONSERVATION
DISTRICTS.
The
6


bill
amends
a
provision
which
establishes
a
conservation
7


practices
revolving
loan
fund
within
the
soil
conservation
8


division,
to
be
used
only
to
make
loans
directly
to
owners
9


of
land
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
new
permanent
soil
10


and
water
conservation
practices.
The
bill
provides
that
11


revolving
loan
fund
moneys
may
be
used
in
combination
with
12


public
cost-sharing
moneys.
The
bill
increases
the
amount
that
13


an
owner
may
receive
under
the
program
from
$10,000
to
$20,000.
14


DIVISION
II
——
WEIGHTS
AND
MEASURES.
The
bill
amends
a
15


provision
that
requires
the
department
to
designate
one
of
16


its
assistants
to
act
as
the
state
metrologist
of
weights
17


and
measures.
Specifically,
the
bill
provides
that
such
18


designation
is
discretionary.
19


DIVISION
III
——
MOTOR
FUEL
STANDARDS.
The
bill
amends
a
20


number
of
provisions
relating
to
motor
fuel
standards
(Code
21


section
214A.2).
It
eliminates
octane
standards
for
leaded
22


gasoline.
23


The
bill
also
provides
for
gasoline
that
contains
a
certain
24


percentage
of
ethanol.
Ethanol
blended
gasoline
is
designated
25


E-xx
where
“xx”
is
the
volume
percent
of
ethanol
in
the
ethanol
26


blended
gasoline.
27


Currently,
the
term
“standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline”
28


refers
to
ethanol
blended
gasoline
that
is
used
to
power
29


vehicles
other
than
flexible
fuel
vehicles
(Code
section
30


214A.1).
Generally,
standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline
must
31


contain
between
9
and
10
percent
ethanol
by
volume
(so-called
32


E-10).
However,
it
may
also
contain
a
higher
percentage
as
33


authorized
by
the
department
as
long
as
it
is
approved
by
the
34


United
States
environmental
protection
agency
(EPA)
(Code

section
214A.2).
The
bill
provides
that
such
gasoline
is
for
1


use
in
gasoline-powered
vehicles
not
required
to
be
flexible
2


fuel
vehicles.
It
also
increases
the
percentage
of
ethanol
3


allowed
in
standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline
to
15
percent
4


by
volume
(E-15).
The
department
may
still
increase
the
5


percentage
if
authorized
by
the
department
with
approval
by
the
6


EPA.
7


The
department
is
required
to
test
samples
of
motor
fuel
or
8


biofuels
to
ensure
that
they
comply
with
the
standards.
It
9


increases
the
maximum
sample
size
from
16
fluid
ounces
to
one
10


gallon
(Code
section
214A.7).
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
11


allowing
a
retail
dealer
of
motor
fuel
to
post
a
notice
showing
12


the
results
of
the
tests
(Code
section
214A.9).
13


The
bill
amends
a
provision
which
requires
a
decal
be
affixed
14


to
a
motor
fuel
pump
notifying
consumers
that
it
is
dispensing
15


ethanol
blended
gasoline
(Code
section
214A.16).
The
bill
16


provides
that
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
ethanol
blended
17


gasoline
containing
a
percentage
of
ethanol
ranging
between
11
18


and
15
percent
(E-11
to
E-15)
must
be
affixed
with
a
decal
as
19


prescribed
by
EPA.
