EXPLANATION
11


This
bill
directs
the
Iowa
utilities
board
to
require
12


rate-related
public
utilities
and
generation
and
transmission
13


electric
cooperatives
to
purchase
specified
amounts
of
14


electricity
from
farm-owned
distributed
generation
facilities.
15


The
bill
defines
a
“distributed
generation
facility”
to
mean
16


a
biomass
conversion
facility,
a
solar
energy
conversion
17


facility,
or
a
wind
energy
conversion
facility,
as
those
terms
18


are
defined
in
Code
section
476C.1,
which
is
located
on
farm
19


property
and
meets
specified
ownership
requirements
contained
20


in
Code
section
476C.1,
subsection
6.
21


Rate-regulated
electric
utilities
and
generation
and
22


transmission
electric
cooperatives
would
be
required
within
23


five
years
to
be
purchasing
a
minimum
of
2
percent
of
their
24


required
electrical
output
from
distributed
generation
25


facilities.
The
bill
specifies
percentage
requirements
26


applicable
to
the
purchase
of
electricity
from
wind,
solar,
27


and
biomass
facilities,
and
further
specifies
percentage
28


requirements
applicable
to
such
purchases
from
facilities
29


of
varying
sizes.
If
the
utility
or
cooperative
fails
to
30


document
purchasing
the
required
amounts
and
percentages,
the
31


bill
states
that
the
civil
penalty
provisions
of
Code
section
32


476A.14
shall
be

This
penalty
shall
not
exceed
33


$10,000
for
each
day
of
continuing
violation.
The
bill
also
34


provides
that
the
board
may

or
cooperative
and
distributed
generation
4


facilities,
which
would
continue
in
effect
for
20
years
and
be

calculated
at
reasonable
and
competitive
rates.
A
distributed

generating
facility,

defined
in
the
bill,
of
up
to
20
7


megawatts
of

generating
capacity
would
be
eligible

The
bill
provides
that
the
contract
forms

shall
not
contain
