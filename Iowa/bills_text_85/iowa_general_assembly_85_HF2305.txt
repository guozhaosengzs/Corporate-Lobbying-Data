EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
administration
of
programs
by
4


the
economic
development
authority
(EDA)
by
modifying
the
5


high
quality
jobs
program,
creating
a
workforce

tax
6


incentives
program,
and
repealing
the
enterprise
zone
program.

DIVISION
I
——
HIGH
QUALITY
JOBS
PROGRAM.
Division
I
modifies
8


the
high
quality
jobs
program
administered
by
the
EDA.
The
9


division
adds
a
definition
for
“project”
for
purposes
of
the
10


program
and
strikes
language
that
references
the
start-up,
11


location,
or
expansion
of
an
eligible
business,
and
replaces
12


it
with
reference
to
a
“project”.
“Project”
is
defined
as
an
13


activity
or
set
of
activities
directly
related
to
the
start-up,
14


location,
modernization,
or
expansion
of
a
business,
and
15


proposed
in
an
application
by
a
business,
that
will
result
in
16


the
accomplishment
of
the
goals
of
the
program.
17


The
division
amends
the
requirements
for
claiming
the
sales
18


and
use
tax
refund
under
the
program
for
the
construction
or
19


equipping
of
a
facility
of
the
eligible
business
to
require
20


that
the
facility
also
be
part
of
a
project.
21


The
division
modifies
the
type
of
projects
that
will
qualify
22


for
tax
incentives
or
project
completion
assistance
under
23


the
program.
Under
current
law,
the
EDA
only
provides
tax
24


incentives
or
project
completion
assistance
to
businesses
25


creating
jobs
if
the
business
will
pay
at
least
120
percent
of
26


the
qualifying
wage
threshold,
unless
the
business
is
located
27


in
an
economically
distressed
area,
in
which
case
the
business
28


must
pay
at
least
100
percent
of
the
qualifying
wage
threshold.
29


Economically
distressed
areas
include
the
25
lowest-ranked
Iowa
30


counties
by
average
monthly
or
annual
unemployment.
31


The
division
amends
the
definition
of
“economically
32


distressed
area”
by
increasing
to
33
from
25
the
number
of
Iowa
33


counties
that
will
qualify
as
an
economically
distressed
area.
34


The
division
also
permits
businesses

DIVISION
II
——
WORKFORCE
HOUSING
TAX
INCENTIVES
PROGRAM.
11


Division
II
creates
a
workforce
housing
tax
incentives
program
12


(program)
that
will
be
administered
by
the
EDA
and
that
will
13


provide
tax
incentives
to
housing
businesses
that
complete
14


housing
projects
in
the
state.
A
“housing
business”
means
a
15


business
that
is
a
housing
developer,
housing
contractor,
or
16


nonprofit
organization
that
completes
a
housing
project
in
the
17


state.
In
order
to
qualify
for
the
tax
incentives
under
the
18


program,
a
housing
project
must
meet
several
requirements.
19


First,
the
housing
project
must
consist
of
a
certain
type
20


and
number
of
dwelling
units.
The
project
must
include,
at
21


a
minimum,
four
or
more
single-family
dwelling
units,
one
or
22


more
multiple
dwelling
unit
buildings
that
each
contain
three
23


or
more
individual
dwelling
units,
or
two
or
more
dwelling
24


units
located
in
the
upper
story
of
an
existing
multi-use
25


building.
“Multi-use
building”
is
defined
as
a
building
26


whose
street-level
ground
story
is
used
for
a
purpose
that
is
27


other
than
residential,
and
whose
upper
story
or
stories
are
28


currently
used
for
a
residential
purpose,
or
will
be
used
for
29


a
residential
purpose
after
completion
of
the
housing
project
30


associated
with
the
building.
31


Second,
the
housing
project
must
involve
a
certain
type
of
32


development
in
a
certain
geographic
location.
The
project
may
33


involve
the
rehabilitation,
repair,
or
redevelopment
of
any
34


dwelling
unit
if
it
occurs
at
a
brownfield
or
grayfield
site,
35


-22-


LSB

H.F.
2305


as
those
terms
are
defined
in
the
bill,
or
in
a
distressed
1


workforce
housing
community.
The
project
may
involve
the
2


rehabilitation,
repair,
or
redevelopment
anywhere
in
the
state
3


of
a
dilapidated
dwelling
unit
or
a
dwelling
unit
located
in
4


the
upper
story
of
an
existing
multi-use
building.
The
project
5


may
involve
the
new
construction
of
a
dwelling
unit
if
it
is
in
6


a
distressed
workforce
housing
community,
but
shall
not
include
7


the
new
construction
of
a
multi-use
building.
8


The
designation
of
a
community
as
a
distressed
workforce
9


housing
community
shall
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
EDA
10


after
it
considers
the
merits
of
all
applications
for
such
a
11


designation
and
the
demand
for
projects
in
distressed
workforce
12


housing
communities
compared
to
the
demand
for
all
other
13


projects
and
after
considering
whether
or
not
a
particular
14


community
has
a
severe
housing
shortage
relative
to
demand,
15


low
vacancy
rates,
or
rising
housing
costs
combined
with
low
16


unemployment.
“Community”
means
a
city
or
county.
17


Third,
the
average
dwelling
unit
cost
of
a
housing
project
18


must
not
exceed
$200,000
per
dwelling
unit,
or
$250,000
per
19


dwelling
unit
if
the
project
involves
the
rehabilitation,
20


repair,
redevelopment,
or
preservation
of
“eligible
property”,
21


which
means
the
same
as
defined
for
purposes
of
the
historic
22


preservation
and
cultural
and
entertainment
district
tax
credit
23


in
Code
chapter
404A
and
includes
property
listed
or
eligible
24


for
listing
on
the
national
register
of
historic
places
or
25


property
designated
or
eligible
for
designation
as
of
historic
26


significance
to
a
district
listed
in
the
national
register
of
27


historic
places
or
property
or
a
district
designated
a
local
28


landmark
by
a
city
or
county
ordinance
or
property
that
is
a
29


barn
constructed
prior
to
1937.
30


Fourth,
the
dwelling
units
that
are
part
of
the
housing
31


project
must
meet
the
United
States
Department
of
Housing
and
32


Urban
Development’s
housing
quality
standards
and
applicable
33


local
safety
standards.

H.F.

project
under
the
program
is
required
to
apply
to
the
EDA.
1


The
application
must
include
a
resolution
in
support
of
the
2


housing
project
by
the
community
where
the
housing
project
will
3


be
located,
documentation
of
local
matching
funds
pledged
of
4


$1,000
or
more
per
dwelling
unit,
a
funding
agreement
between
5


the
housing
business
and
the
community,
a
report
describing
all
6


violations
of
environmental
law
or
worker
safety
law
within
the
7


last
five
years,
and
any
other
information
deemed
necessary
by
8


the
EDA
to
evaluate
the
eligibility
and
financial
need
of
the
9


housing
project
under
the
program.
The
EDA
is
not
required
to
10


accept
applications
on
a
continuous
basis.
Upon
review
of
an
11


application,
the
EDA
may
register
a
housing
project
under
the
12


program.
The
EDA
is
required
to
notify
a
housing
business
of
13


successful
registration
and
the
amount
of
tax
incentives
for
14


which
the
EDA
preliminarily
determines
it
qualifies
for.
A
15


housing
business
is
then
required
to
enter
into
an
agreement
16


with
the
EDA
for
the
successful
completion
of
its
housing
17


project
within
three
years
from
the
date
it
was
registered
by
18


the
EDA.
A
compliance
cost
fee
equal
to
0.5
percent
of
the
19


value
of
the
tax
incentives
claimed
pursuant
to
an
agreement
20


will
be
imposed
upon
all
agreements
with
an
aggregate
tax
21


incentive
value
of
$100,000
or
greater.
22


A
housing
business
that
fails
to
comply
with
the
23


requirements
of
the
program
or
the
terms
of
an
agreement
with
24


the
EDA
may
have
its
tax
incentives
reduced,
terminated,
or
25


rescinded,
and
may
be
subject
to
the
repayment
or
recapture
of
26


claimed
tax
incentives.
27


Upon
completion
of
a
registered
housing
project,
a
28


housing
business
must
have
its
housing
project
audited
by
29


an
independent
certified
public
accountant
licensed
in
this
30


state.
The
EDA
will
then
review
the
audit,
verify
the
amount
31


of
workforce
investment
tax
credits
the
eligible
business
may
32


claim,
and
issue
a
tax
credit
certificate
for
that
amount.
33


The
maximum
amount
of
tax
incentives
that
may
be
awarded
34


by
the
EDA
to
a
housing
business
for
a
housing
project
shall
35


-24-


LSB
5320HV
(2)
85


mm/sc
24/
28



H.F.

not
exceed
$1
million.
In
the
event
a
housing
business
1


qualifies
for
tax
incentives
in
excess
of
$1
million,
the
2


housing
business
and
EDA
may
negotiate
an
apportionment
of
the
3


reduction
between
the
program’s
two
tax
incentives.
4


The
program
provides
two
different
tax
incentives.
The
5


first
is
a
refund
of
the
sales
and
use
taxes
paid
that
are
6


directly
related
to
the
housing
project.
The
bill
provides
7


that
the
willful
making
of
a
false
report
in
connection
with
8


the
sales
and
use
tax
refund
is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
A
simple
9


misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
10


days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625,
or
by
11


both.
The
second
is
a
workforce
housing
investment
tax
credit
12


in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
10
percent
of
the
qualifying
new
13


investment
of
the
housing
project.
“Qualifying
new
investment”
14


means
the
costs
directly
related
to
the
acquisition,
repair,
15


rehabilitation,
or
redevelopment
of
the
housing
project.
16


“Qualifying
new
investment”
also
includes
costs
that
are
17


directly
related
to
new
construction
of
dwelling
units
if
the
18


new
construction
occurs
in
a
distressed
workforce
housing
19


community.
However,
“qualifying
new
investment”
does
not
20


include
the
portion
of
the
total
costs
financed
by
federal,
21


state,
or
local
government
tax
credits,
grants,
forgivable
22


loans,
or
other
forms
of
nonrepayable
financial
assistance,
23


excluding
the
tax
incentives
provided
under
the
program.
Also,
24


if
the
housing
project
includes
the
rehabilitation,
repair,
or
25


redevelopment
of
an
existing
multi-use
building,
“qualifying
26


new
investment”
does
not
include
the
portion
of
the
total
27


acquisition
costs
of
the
multi-use
building
that
is
used
for
a
28


purpose
that
is
other
than
residential.
29


The
workforce
housing
investment
tax
credit
may
be
claimed
30


against
the
individual
income
tax,
the
corporate
income
31


tax,
the
franchise
tax,
the
insurance
companies
tax,
and
the
32


moneys
and
credits
tax.
To
claim
a
tax
credit,
a
taxpayer
33


must
include
a
tax
credit
certificate
with
the
taxpayer’s
34


tax
return.
The
credit
is
nonrefundable
but
may
be
credited
35


-25-


LSB

to
the
tax
liability
for
five
years.
The
tax
credit
may
1


be
transferred
to
any
person
or
entity,
and
the
division
2


establishes
procedures
for
the
proper
transfer
of
the
tax
3


credit.
For
purposes
of
the
individual
and
corporate
income
4


taxes
and
the
franchise
tax,
when
the
tax
basis
of
property
is
5


increased
as
a
result
of
qualifying
new
investment,
that
tax
6


basis
shall
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
workforce
housing
7


investment
tax
credit
issued
under
the
program.
8


The
division
provides
that
the
program
is
part
of
the
EDA’s
9


maximum
aggregate
tax
credit
cap
of
$170
million
per
fiscal
10


year,
and
not
more
than
$20
million
per
fiscal
year
may
be
11


issued
by
the
EDA
under
the
program.
The
EDA
is
required
12


to
issue
tax
incentives
under
the
program
on
a
first-come,
13


first-served
basis
until
the
maximum
amount
of
$20
million
14


per
fiscal
year
is
reached.
If
the
amount
of
tax
incentives
15


exceeds
this
amount
in
a
fiscal
year,
the
EDA
is
required
to
16


establish
a
wait
list
and
give
priority
in
subsequent
years
to
17


the
registered
housing
projects
on
the
wait
list.
18


The
EDA
and
the

of
revenue
are
required
to
adopt
19


rules
as
necessary
for
the
joint
administration
of
