Violations
defined.
10


a.
A
violation
shall
be
considered
a
first
violation
by

if

did
not
12


occur
during
a
probationary

3,
paragraph

,
for

19

Secretary

state
database.
The
secretary
of
state
21


shall
maintain
copies
of

of
subsection

and
make
the
court
25


orders
available
on
the
secretary
of
state’s
internet
site.
26


7.
Federal
determination
creates
rebuttable
presumption.
In
27


determining
whether
an
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien,
the
28


court
shall
consider
the
federal
government’s
determination
29


of
the
immigration
status
of
the
employee
pursuant
to
8
30


U.S.C.
§1373(c).
The
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
the
31


federal
government’s
determination.
The
federal
government’s
32


determination
that
the
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien
33


creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
the
employee’s
unauthorized
34


status.
The
employer
may
present
evidence
that
the
employee
35

is
not
an
unauthorized
alien.

8.
Good-faith
compliance.
For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
2


an
employer
that
establishes
that
it
has
complied
in
good
3


faith
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§1324a(b)
establishes
4


a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the
employer
did
not
5


knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
An
employer
is
6


considered
to
have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
7


§1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
8


technical
or
procedural
failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
9


there
is
a
good-faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
10


9.
Entrapment
as
affirmative
defense.
11


a.
It
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
violation
of
subsection
12


1
that
the
employer
was
entrapped.
To
claim
entrapment,
the
13


employer
must
admit
by
the
employer’s
testimony
or
other
14


evidence
the
substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
15


employer
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
16


of
proving
all
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
17


evidence:
18


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
19


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the
20


employer.
21


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
22


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
23


(3)
The
employer
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
violation
24


before
the
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
25


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
26


b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
27


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
28


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
an
29


opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
It
is
not
entrapment
for
30


law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
merely
to
use
a
ruse
31


or
to
conceal
their
identity.
The
conduct
of
law
enforcement
32


officers
and
their
agents
may
be
considered
in
determining
if
33


an
employer
has
proven
entrapment.

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
prohibits
employers
from
knowingly
employing
3


unauthorized
aliens.
4


The
bill
defines
“employer”
as
a
person
that
transacts
5


business
in
this
state,
that
has
a
license
issued
by
an
agency
6


in
this
state,
and
that
employs
25
or
more
full-time
employees
7


in
this
state.
“Employer”
includes
this
state,
a
political
8


subdivision
of
this
state,
and
a
self-employed
individual.
9


In
the
case
of
an
independent
contractor,
“employer”
means
10


the
independent
contractor
and
does
not
mean
the
person
or
11


organization
that
uses
the
contract
labor.
12


The
bill
requires
the
county
attorney
to
bring
an
action
13


in
district
court
against
an
employer
for
a
violation
in
the
14


county
where
the
unauthorized
alien
employee
is
or
was
employed
15


by
the
employer.
The
bill
provides
that
such
an
action
must
be
16


expedited
by
the
court.
17


The
bill
provides
that
for
a
first
violation,
the
court
18


must
order
the
employer
to
terminate
the
employment
of
all
19


unauthorized
aliens
and
to
submit
a
signed
sworn
affidavit
20


to
that
effect
or
face
suspension
of
business
licenses
by
21


appropriate
agencies.
The
court
will
also
order
a
three-year
22


probationary
period
for
the
employer.
The
court
may
also
23


order
the
suspension
of
the
employer’s
business
licenses
24


by
appropriate
agencies
for
up
to
10
business
days,
after
25


considering
certain
factors.
The
bill
provides
that
for
a
26


second
violation,
defined
as
a
violation
occurring
during
a
27


probationary
period
for
a
previous
violation,
the
court
must
28


order
the
permanent
revocation
of
the
employer’s
business
29


licenses.
The
bill
directs
the
secretary
of
state
to
maintain
30


an
online
database
of
first-time
offenders.
31


In
determining
the
immigration
status
of
an
alleged
32


unauthorized
alien
employed
by
an
employer,
the
bill
requires
33


the
district
court
to
consider
the
federal
government’s
34


determination
of
the
immigration
status
of
the
employee.
The
35


-8-


LSB

(6)

je/rj


8/
10



S.F.
2171


federal
government’s
determination
that
the
employee
is
an
1


unauthorized
alien
creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
the
2


employee’s
unauthorized
status.
The
employer
may
present
3


evidence
that
the
employee
is
not
an
unauthorized
alien.
4


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
who
establishes
that
5


the
employer
complied
in
good
faith
with
8
U.S.C.
§1324a(b)
6


establishes
a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the
employer
7


did
not
knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
The
bill
8


provides
that
an
employer
is
considered
to
have
complied
with
9


the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
10


isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
technical
or
procedural
11


failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
there
is
a
good-faith
12


attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
The
bill
provides
an
13


employer
with
an
affirmative
defense
of
entrapment
if
certain
14


elements
are
met.
15


The
bill
requires
an
employer
hiring
a
new
employee
to
16


verify
the
employee’s
employment
eligibility
through
the
17


federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
requires
the
employer
18


to
keep
records
of
the
verification
for
the
duration
of
the
19


employee’s
employment
or
three
years,
whichever
is
longer.
The
20


bill
requires
an
employer
receiving
an
economic
development
21


incentive
from
a
state
government
entity
to
register
with
the
22


federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
23


who
does
not
comply
with
the
requirement
must
repay
all
moneys
24


received
for
the
economic
development
incentive.
The
bill
25


provides
an
employer
the
right
to
appeal
a
determination
of
26


noncompliance,
and
does
not
require
repayment
until
a
final
27


determination
of
noncompliance
is
made.
The
bill
directs
the
28


secretary
of
state
to
request
from
the
United
States
department
29


of
homeland
security
a
list
of
employers
registered
with
the
30


e-verify
program
every
three
months.
The
bill
directs
the
31


secretary
of
state
to
make
the
list
available
on
the
secretary
32


of
state’s
internet
site.
33


The
bill
provides
that
the
bill
shall
not
be
construed
34


to
require
an
employer
to
take
any
action
that
the
employer
35

believes
in
good
faith
would
violate
federal
or
state
law.
1


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
2


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
3


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
4


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
5


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
6


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
7


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
