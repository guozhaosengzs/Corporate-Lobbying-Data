908.2A
(appointment

The

strikes
the
current
provisions
for
judicial
review
16


of
an
indigent
fee
claim
in
Code
section
13B.4(4)(d)
and

replaces

Code
section
13B.4A.
Under
18


the
bill,
an
indigent
defense
claimant
may
seek
judicial
review
19


of
the
final
agency
action
of
the
state
public
defender
denying
20


or
reducing
an

claim
by
filing
a
motion
21


for
judicial
review
in
the
court
with
jurisdiction
over
the
22


original
court
appointment.
23


The

requires
the
motion
to
be
filed
within
20
days
of
24


the
date
that
the
state
public
defender
provides
notice
of
the
25


final
agency
action
to
the
claimant.
The
bill
also
requires
26


the
motion
to
clearly
and
concisely
set
forth
the
grounds
27


for
error
the
claimant
intends
to
rely
upon
when
challenging
28


the
final
agency
action
of
the
state
public
defender.
Under
29


the
bill,
failure
to
seek
judicial
review
within
20
days
of
30


the
notice
provided
by
the
state
public
defender
precludes
31


any
judicial
review
of
the
action
taken
by
the

32


defender.
33


The
bill
requires
the
motion
to

set
for
a
hearing
and
that
34


the

public
defender
be
provided
at

The

The

Under
the

19


the

to

pay

In
determining
whether

moneys
paid

paid
to

are

the

requires
the

If

of

state

to

the

to
be
paid
to
the
26


attorney
are
insufficient
to
pay
the
expenses
as
calculated
27


by
the
court.
If
the
private
attorney
is
retained
on
a
flat
28


fee
agreement,
and
a
precise
record
of
hours
worked
is
not
29


available,
the

requires

to
30


provide
the

a
reasonable
estimate

expended
to
31


allow
the
