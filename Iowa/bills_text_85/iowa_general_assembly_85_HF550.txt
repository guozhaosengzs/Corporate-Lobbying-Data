(DHS).
1


Code
sections
135B.34
and
135C.33,
relating
to
criminal
and
2


child
or
dependent
adult
abuse
record
checks
of
employees
of
3


hospitals
(135B.34)
and
health
care
facilities
and
certified
4


nurse
aide
student
trainees
(135C.33),
are
amended.
Code
5


section
135B.34
is
amended
to
conform
with
an
amendment
made
6


to
Code
section
135C.33
in
2012.
Under
the
amendment,
if
a
7


person
with
a
criminal
or
abuse
record
is
or
was
employed
by
a
8


hospital
and
is
hired
by
another
hospital,
the
person
remains
9


subject
to
another
record
check.
However,
if
DHS
previously
10


evaluated
the
record
and
determined
the
record
did
not
warrant
11


prohibition
of
the
person’s
employment,
a
reevaluation
of
the
12


record
is
not
required
if
the
conditions
specified
in
the
bill
13


are
met.
The
conditions
include
that
the
new
position
is
14


substantially
the
same
as
the
previous
position,
that
any
DHS
15


restrictions
from
the
previous
evaluation
remain
applicable,
16


and
the
employee
either
provides
a
physical
copy
of
the
17


evaluation
or
the
previous
hospital
provides
it.
Although
18


the
exemption
conditions
are
met,
the
new
hospital
may
still
19


request
a
reevaluation
of
the
record
and
employ
the
person
20


while
the
reevaluation
is
pending.
21


Both
Code
sections
are
amended
to
allow
conditional
22


employment
of
prospective
employees
under
certain
23


circumstances.
In
addition
to
nurse
aide
student
trainees,
24


Code
section
135C.33
applies
to
prospective
employees
25


of
nursing
facilities,
residential
care
facilities,
and
26


intermediate
care
facilities
for
persons
with
mental
illness
or
27


a
developmental
disability,
various
in-home
service
providers,
28


hospices,
Medicaid
waiver
service
providers,
elder
group
homes,
29


and
assisted
living
programs.
30


Current
law
provides
that
if
it
is
determined
that
a
31


person
being
considered
for
employment
has
been
convicted
of
32


a
crime
under
a
law
of
any
state,
the
department
of
public
33


safety
shall
notify
the
licensee
that
upon
the
request
of
the
34


licensee
DHS
will
perform
an
evaluation
to
determine
whether
35

H.F.
550


the
crime
warrants
prohibition
of
the
person’s
employment
in
1


the
facility.
2


The
bill
allows
for
conditional
employment
of
not
more
than
3


60
calendar
days
of
the
prospective
employee
who
was
convicted
4


of
a
crime
specified
by
the
bill
pending
completion
of
the
DHS
5


evaluation.
The
bill
does
not
apply
to
employment
involving
6


the
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
or
to
persons
with
a
record
7


of
founded
child
or
dependent
adult
abuse.
The
crimes
covered
8


by
the
bill
are
limited
to
simple
misdemeanor
offenses
under
9


Code
section
123.47,
involving
purchase
or
possession
of

of
operating
a
motor
vehicle
while
13


intoxicated
under
section
321J.2,
subsection
1
(a
serious
14


misdemeanor).
15


A
similar
new
conditional
employment
exception
is
applied
by
16


the
bill
to
students
applying
for,
enrolled
in,
or
returning
to
17


a
certified
nurse
aide
training
program.
18


The
department
of
inspections
and

conjunction
19


with
the
departments
of
administrative
services,
human
20


services,
public
health,

is
required
21


to
study
the
potential
for
applying
new
technologies
and

other
improvements
that
may
be
implemented
for
the
current
23


processes
of
performing
and
evaluating
child
and
dependent
24


adult
abuse
and
criminal
record
checks
of
persons
providing
25


health
care
services.
In
addition,
the
study
is
required
to
26


consider
applying
record
check
requirements
to
individuals
and
27


agencies
providing
home
health
services
that
are
not
subject
28


to
certification,
licensing,
or
other
regulation
by
state
29


government.
The
department
is
required
to
report
with
findings
30


and
recommendations
to
the
governor
and
general
assembly
on
or
31


before
