H.F.
_____


This
bill
amends
Code
section
321.306,
which
contains
1


requirements
for
driving
a
vehicle
on
roadways
laned
for
2


traffic.
Currently,
the
requirement
to
drive
as
nearly
as
3


practical
entirely
within
a
single
lane
is
combined
with
the
4


requirement
not
to
move
from
the
lane
until
the
driver
has
5


first
ascertained
that
the
movement
can
be
made
safely.
The
6


bill
separates
those
two
requirements
and
makes
semantic
7


changes
to
the
language
of
the
Code
section.
8


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
9


Code
section
321.306
is
a
simple
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
a
10


scheduled
fine
of
$100.
A
violation
that
causes
serious
injury
11


to
or
the
death
of
a
person
may
be
subject
to
an
additional
fine
12


and
driver’s
license
suspension.
