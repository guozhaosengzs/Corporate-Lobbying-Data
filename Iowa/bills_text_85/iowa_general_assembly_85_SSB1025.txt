Currently,
a
business
is
generally
ineligible
to
receive
3


economic
development
assistance
under
the

program
if
the
business
has
a
record
that
tends

show
5


a
consistent
pattern
of
violations
of
the
law,
including
6


environmental
and
worker
safety
laws
as
well
as
violations
7


of
related
rules
and
regulations.
The
division
adds
that
8


a
business
is
also
ineligible
for
economic

9


assistance
if
the

or

a

in
violating
any
laws,
11


including
environmental,
worker
safety,
and
antitrust
laws
is
12


intentional,

Current

entered

15


between
the

The

include
the
requirements
18


that
a
business
receiving
incentives
or
assistance
must
19


maintain
throughout
the
period
of
the

The
authority
20


must
ensure
that
a

the
incentives

21


assistance
if
the
business
meets
the
initial
eligibility
22


requirements
and
maintains
the

the

the

this

is
29


a

the
department
of
revenue
by
30


a
taxpayer,
and
the
taxpayer’s
failure

31


may
be
treated
by
