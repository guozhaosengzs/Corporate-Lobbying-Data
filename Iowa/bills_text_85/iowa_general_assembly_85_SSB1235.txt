EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
envelopes
provided
to
absentee
voters.
18


Under
current
law,
absentee
ballots
mailed
to
a
voter
are
19


required
to
be
enclosed
in
an
unsealed
envelope
bearing
a
20


serial
number
and
an
affidavit,
which
are
then
required
to
be
21


enclosed
in
or
with
a
return
envelope,
all
of
which
are
then
22


required
to
be
enclosed
in
a
third
envelope
to
be
sent
to
the
23


registered
voter
requesting
an
absentee
ballot.
24


The
bill
allows
for
an
affidavit
to
be
imprinted
on
the
25


return
envelope.
If
a
return
envelope
imprinted
with
the
26


affidavit
is
used,
absentee
ballots
mailed
to
a
voter
are
27


required
to
be
enclosed
in
the
unsealed
return
envelope
28


imprinted
with
the
affidavit
which
is
required
to
be
enclosed
29


in
a
second
envelope
to
be
sent
to
the
registered
voter
30


requesting
an
absentee
ballot.
The
bill
allows
a
county
31


commissioner
of
elections
to
continue
sending
absentee
ballots
32


as
provided
under
current
law
or
to
send
absentee
ballots
33


utilizing
a
return
envelope
imprinted
with
the
affidavit.
The
34


bill
makes
additional
conforming
changes.
