satisfactory
evidence
that
there
has
been
a
breakdown
of
1


the
marriage
relationship
to
the
extent
that
the
legitimate
2


objects
of
matrimony
have

and

or

of

in

A

obligation
imposed
by

as
a
result

for
the
11


support
of
the

with
mental
illness.
The
court
may
12


make
issue
an
order
for
the
support
or
may
waive
the
support
13


obligation
when
satisfied
from
the
evidence
that
it
would

create
an
undue
hardship
on
the
obliged
spouse
or
that
spouse’s

EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
the
grounds
that
must
be
alleged
in
18


a
petition
for
dissolution
of
marriage.
The
bill
retains
19


the
present
grounds
of
an
allegation
that
there
has
been
a
20


breakdown
of
the
marriage
relationship
to
the
extent
that
21


the
legitimate
objects
of
matrimony
have
been
destroyed
and
22


there
remains
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
marriage
can
23


be
preserved
in
circumstances
in
which
there
is
no
minor
child
24


affected.
However,
when
a
minor
child
may
be
affected
by
the
25


controversy,
the
bill
establishes
five
grounds
that
may
be
26


alleged
in
the
petition
for
dissolution:
27


1.
The
other
party
has
committed
adultery.
28


2.
The
other
party
has
committed
a
felony
and
has
been
29


sentenced
to
imprisonment.
30


3.
The
other
party
has
abandoned
the
matrimonial
domicile
31


for
a
period
of
one
year
or
more
and
refuses
to
return.
32


4.
The
other
party
has
physically
or
sexually
abused
the
33


party
seeking
the
order
or
dissolution
or
a
child
of
one
of
the
34


parties.

5.
The
parties
have
been
living
separate
and
apart
1


continuously
without
reconciliation
for
a
period
of
two
years
2


or
more.
3


The
bill
also
makes
conforming
changes
in
Code
chapter
598
4


(dissolution
of
marriage
and
domestic
relations)
to
reflect
the
5


difference
in
applicable
grounds
contingent
upon
whether
or
not
6


a
minor
child
may
be
affected.
