11


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
12


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
13


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
14


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
15


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
16


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
17


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
