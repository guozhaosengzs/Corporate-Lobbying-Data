Second,
the

disclosure
may
be
made

18


governmental
entities

prevent
a
breach
of
security
regarding
19


electronic

the
regional

20


or
the
governmental

or
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
issued
in
21


connection
with
a
civil
or
criminal
investigation.
22


The
bill
provides
that
a
violation
of
the
bill’s
provisions
23


is
punishable
by
a
civil

in
an
amount
not
