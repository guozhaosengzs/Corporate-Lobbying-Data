Legislative
findings
——
purpose.

The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
12


1.
Renewable
energy
production
and
energy
efficiency
13


improvements
to
residential,
commercial,
and
industrial
real
14


property,
are
necessary
to
address
the
issue
of
energy
bill
15


stabilization.
16


2.
The
initial
investment
required
to
make
residential,
17


commercial,
or
industrial
real
property
more
energy-efficient
18


or
to
utilize
renewable
energy
prevents
many
property
owners
19


from
making
such
improvements.
To
make
energy
improvements
20


more
affordable
and
to
promote
their
installation,
it
is
21


necessary
to
authorize
an
alternative
procedure
for
owners
of
a
22


residence
or
business
to
finance
such
improvements.
23


3.
The
general
assembly
declares
that
a
public
purpose
24


shall
be
served
by
authorizing
cities
and
counties
to
establish
25


energy
finance
programs
and
authorizing
the
governing
body
26


of
any
city
or
county
to
assist
property
owners
in
financing
27


the
installation
of
renewable
energy
improvements
and

28


efficiency
improvements
by
offering
financial

This

to
finance
energy
improvements
for
the

physical
alteration
to

production
facility
which
has
been
identified

in

analysis
as
improving
the

10


operation
of
a
building
or
as
decreasing
the
amount
of
energy
11


consumed
by
that
building,
or

The
bill
defines
an
12


“energy

as
a

summarizing
the

13


of
a
physical
inspection
of
a
residential,

efficiency
operation
and

recommending

18


Pursuant

The

The
