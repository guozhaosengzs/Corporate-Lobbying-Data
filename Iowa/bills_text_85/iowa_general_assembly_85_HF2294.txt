EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
17


This
bill
requires
the
driver
of
a
vehicle
traveling
in
18


the
passing
lane
of
a
divided
highway
to
the
left
and
abreast
19


of
another
vehicle,
when
being
approached
by
an
overtaking
20


vehicle,
to
move
to
the
right
as
soon
as
the
driver
can
safely
21


do
so
to
allow
the
overtaking
vehicle
to
pass.
The
bill
also
22


prohibits
driving
in
the
passing
lane
of
a
highway
if
the
speed
23


limit
is
65
miles
per
hour
or
more,
except
to
pass
another
24


motor
vehicle
that
is
in
a
nonpassing
lane
or
turning
left,
or
25


unless
the
volume
of
traffic
does
not
permit
the
vehicle
to
26


safely
merge
into
a
nonpassing
lane.
27


The
bill
defines
“passing
lane”
as
the
lane
farthest
to
the
28


left
if
there
are
two
or
more
adjacent
lanes
of
traffic
moving
29


in
the
same
direction
on
one
roadway.
If
the
left
lane
is
30


restricted
to
high
occupancy
vehicle
use
or
is
designed
for
31


left
turns
only,
the
passing
lane
is
the
lane
immediately
to
32


the
right
of
the
high
occupancy
lane
or
left-turn
lane.
The
33


bill
defines
“nonpassing
lane”
as
any
lane
that
is
to
the
right
34


of
the
passing
lane
if
there
are
two
or
more
adjacent
lanes

A
person
who
violates
the
provisions
of
the
bill
commits
2


a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of

3


Additional
penalties
may
apply
if
the
violation
results
in
4


serious
injury
to
or
death
of
another
person.
These
are
the
5


same
penalties
that
currently
apply
to
a
person
who
violates
6


requirements
for
overtaking
and
passing
another
vehicle.
