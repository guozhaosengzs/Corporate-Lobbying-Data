EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
modifies
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
tax
credit
23


program,
which
is
a
pilot
program
enacted
in
2006
to
allow
24


the
diversion
of
withholding
funds
paid
by
an
employer
to
be
25


matched
by
a
designated
pilot
project
city
to
create
economic
26


incentives
that
can
be
directed
toward
businesses
located
27


within
urban
renewal
areas
in
the
city
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
28


a
withholding
agreement
with
a
business
and
after
approval
of
29


the
agreement
by
the
Iowa
economic
development
authority.
30


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
an
employer
that
is
a
31


party
to
a
withholding
agreement
with
a
pilot
project
city
be
32


located
in
an
urban
renewal
area.
The
bill
removes
a
similar
33


requirement
relating
to
the
definition
of
targeted
job.
The
34


bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
Code
section
403.19A
to

S.F.

reflect
the
removal
of
the
urban
renewal
area
requirement,
1


including
providing
that
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
credits
2


be
deposited
in
a
withholding
project
fund
rather
than
the
3


special
fund
established
for
urban
renewal
purposes.
4


The
bill
allows
a
pilot
project
city
to
provide
for
the
5


deposit
of
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
credit
into
the
6


city’s
withholding
project
fund
by
resolution,
rather
than
by
7


ordinance.
8


Under
current
law,
a
pilot
project
city
may
not
enter
into
a
9


withholding
agreement
after
June
30,
2013.
The
bill
extends
10


that
deadline
to
June
30,
2018.
11


The
bill
modifies
the
required
contents
of
a
withholding
12


agreement
and
requires
each
pilot
project
city
to
provide
13


on
an
annual
basis
to
the
economic
development
authority
14


information
documenting
the
compliance
of
each
employer
with
15


each
requirement
of
the
withholding
agreement,
including
but
16


not
limited
to
the
number
of
jobs
created
or
retained
and
the
17


amount
of
investment
made
by
the
employer.
The
bill
requires
18


the
economic
development
authority,
in
response
to
receiving
19


such
information
from
the
pilot
project
city,
to
assess
the
20


level
of
compliance
by
each
employer
and
provide
to
the
pilot
21


project
city
recommendations
for
either
maintaining
employer
22


compliance
with
the
withholding
agreement
or
terminating
23


the
withholding
agreement
for
noncompliance.
The
economic
24


development
authority
must
also
provide
each
such
assessment
25


and
recommendation
report
to
the
department
of
revenue.
26


The
bill
specifies
that
the
pilot
project
city
is
required
27


to
terminate
a
withholding
agreement
if
the
employer
ceases
to
28


meet
the
requirements
of
the
agreement
and
also
requires
that
29


the
department
of
revenue
be
notified
following
termination.
30


Except
as
provided
in
the
bill,
the
bill
applies
to
31


withholding
agreements
entered
into
by
a
pilot
project
city
on
32


or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
The
bill
provides
33


that
withholding
agreements
entered
into
by
a
pilot
project
34


city
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
shall
be
governed
