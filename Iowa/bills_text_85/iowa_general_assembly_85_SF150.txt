EXPLANATION
4


This
bill
contains
several
amendments
to
Code
chapter
148F
5


regulating
orthotic,
prosthetic,
and
pedorthic
practice
and
6


services.
The
name
of
the
national
organization
which
approves
7


the
course
of
instruction
has
been
changed,
and
the
bill
makes
8


related
conforming
changes.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
9


work
component
of
the
licensing
requirement
include
a
clinical
10


component
and
eliminates
provisions
for
internships.
11


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
148F.7
that
12


specified
circumstances
under
which
a
licensed
advanced
13


registered
nurse
practitioner
could
order
care
or
services
14


concerning
the
foot
from
a
licensed
pedorthist
or
orthotist,
15


and,
instead,
generally
gives
a
licensed
advanced
registered
16


nurse
practitioner
that
authority.
17


The
bill
creates
a
transition
period
through
June
30,
18


2014,
allowing
persons
who
are
certified
as
an
orthotist,
19


prosthetist,
or
pedorthist
by
a
national
organization
or
who
20


have
worked
continuously
as
an
orthotist,
prosthetist,
or
21


pedorthist
for
five
of
seven
specified
years
to
be

22


without
otherwise
meeting
the
requirements
of
Code
chapter
23


148F.
