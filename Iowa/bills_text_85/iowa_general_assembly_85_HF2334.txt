Section

Section
279.68,
subsection
2,
paragraph
d,
1


subparagraph
(3),
subparagraph
division
(a),
Code
2014,
is
2


amended
to
read
as
follows:

(a)
Assists
students
assessed
as
exhibiting
a
substantial
4


deficiency
in
reading
to
develop
the
skills
to
read
at
5


grade
level.
Assistance
shall
include
but
not
be
limited
to


6


strategies
that
formally
address
dyslexia.
For
purposes
of


7


this
section,
“dyslexia”
means
a
specific
learning
disability
8


that
is
neurological
in
origin
and
is
characterized
by
9


difficulties
with
accurate
or
fluent
word
recognition
and
by
10


poor
spelling
and
decoding
abilities.
These
difficulties
11


typically
result
from
a
deficit
in
the
phonological
component
12


of
language
that
is
often
unexpected
in
relation
to
other
13


cognitive
abilities
and
the
provision
of
effective
classroom
14


instruction.
Secondary
consequences
may
include
problems
in
15


reading
comprehension
and
reduced
reading
experience
that
can
16


impede
growth
of
vocabulary
and
background
knowledge.

279.68,
