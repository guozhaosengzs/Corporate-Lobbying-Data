Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
Restraining
a
pregnant
woman
can
pose
undue
health
risks
3


to
the
woman
and
her
pregnancy.
4


2.
The
vast
majority
of
female
inmates
or
detainees
in
this
5


state
are
nonviolent
offenders.
6


3.
Restraining
pregnant
prison
inmates
increases
the
7


potential
for
physical
harm
from
an
accidental
trip
or
fall.
8


4.
Freedom
from
physical
restraints
is
especially
critical
9


during
labor,
delivery,
and
postpartum
recovery
after
delivery,
10


because
a
woman
often
needs
to
move
around
during
labor
and
11


recovery.
12


5.
Restraints
on
a
pregnant
woman
can
interfere
with
the
13


ability
of
medical
staff
to
appropriately
assist
in
childbirth
14


or
to
conduct
sudden
emergency
procedures.

The
bill
requires
the
correctional

if
the
25

The
