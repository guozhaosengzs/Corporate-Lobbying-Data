S.F.
_____


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
the
imposition
of
mandatory
minimum
2


sentences
for
certain
criminal
offenses
committed
by
juveniles.
3


The
bill
specifies
that
the
following
mandatory
minimum
4


sentences
are
not
applicable
to
the
criminal
sentencing
and
5


subsequent
incarceration
if
the
person
was
under
18
years
of
6


age
at
the
time
the
underlying
criminal
offense
was
committed:
7


Code
sections
124.413
(mandatory
minimum
for
drug
offenses),
8


902.7
(use
of
a
dangerous
weapon),
902.8
(habitual
offender),
9


902.8A
(minimum
sentence
for
conspiring
to
manufacture,
or
10


delivery
of,
amphetamine
or
methamphetamine
to
a
minor),
902.11
11


(prior
forcible
felon),
and
902.12
(70
percent
sentences).
12


The
bill
also
specifies
in
Code
section
902.1
that
a
person
13


who
commits
a
class
“A”
felony
including
murder
in
the
first
14


degree
and
who
was
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
the
offense
15


was
committed
shall
be
eligible
for
parole.
Current
law
16


specifies
if
the
person
commits
a
class
“A”
felony
other
than
17


murder
in
the
first
degree
the
person
shall
serve
a
mandatory
18


minimum
of
25
years
in
prison
prior
to
being
eligible
for
19


parole.
Current
law
also
specifies
that
if
a
person
commits
20


murder
in
the
first
degree
and
is
under
18
years
of
age
at
the
21


time
the
offense
was
committed
the
person
is
not
eligible
for
22


parole.
However,
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
in
a
recent
23


ruling
in
Miller
v.
Alabama
prohibited
life
sentences
without
24


the
possibility
of
parole
for
a
juvenile
who
commits
murder.
25


The
bill
also
applies
retroactively
to
a
person
convicted
26


under
prior
law
who
was
under
18
years
of
age
at
the
time
27


the
offense
was
committed.
If
necessary,
a
person
shall
be
28


resentenced
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
bill
or
29


the
release
date
from
prison
recalculated
in
accordance
with
30


this
bill.
