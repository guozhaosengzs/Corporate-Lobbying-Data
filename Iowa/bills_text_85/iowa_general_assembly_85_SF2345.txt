This

relates
to
the
apportionment
of
income
of
a
18


broadcaster
for
purposes
of
Iowa
corporate
income
tax.
19


A

is
20


required
to
apportion
its
business
income
among
Iowa
and
the
21


other
states
in
which
it
does
business.
The
amount
of
business
22


income
apportioned
to
Iowa
is
generally
in
the
same
percentage
23


as
the
business’s
gross
sales
made
within
Iowa
if
the
business
24


involves
the
manufacture
or
sale
of
goods
and
products,
or
in
25


the
same
percentage
as
the
business’s
gross
receipts
earned
26


within
Iowa
if
the
business
involves
something
other
than
the
27


manufacture
or
sale
of
goods
and
products.
28


Under
current
law
pursuant
to
Iowa
Administrative
Code
29


701-57.7(5),
a
radio

television
company
doing
business
30


within
and
without
Iowa
is
required
to
apportion
its
business
31


income
to
Iowa
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
Iowa
population
32


served
by
its
broadcasting
bears
to
the
total
population
33


served
by
its
broadcasting.
The
calculation
is
made
using
all
34


residents
of
the
applicable
broadcasting
area,
regardless
of

However,
where
the
8


income
derived
by
the
broadcaster
is
from
national
or
political
9


advertising
directed
exclusively
at
one
or
more
markets
in

all
gross

apportioned
to
Iowa.
12
