EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
a
variety
of
6


matters
administered
by
the
department
of
transportation.
7


The
bill
amends
Code
section
22.7
to
provide
that
personal
8


information
contained
on
electronic
driver’s
license
or
9


nonoperator’s
identification
card
records
that
is
provided
by
10


the
licensee
or
card
holder
for
use
by
certain
law
enforcement
11


and
medical
personnel
responding
to
or
assisting
with
an
12


emergency
constitutes
a
confidential
record.
13


Under
current
law,
a
person
is
disqualified
from
operating
14


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
if
the
person
has
two
or
more
15


convictions
within
a
three-year
period
for
certain
specified
16


offenses
committed
while
operating
a
commercial
motor
vehicle,
17


or
committed
while
operating
a
noncommercial
motor
vehicle
and
18


holding
a
commercial
driver’s
license
if
the
convictions
result
19


in
a
sanction
of
the
person’s
driving
privileges.
Code
section
20


321.208
is
amended
to
add
texting
and
using
a
hand-held
mobile
21


telephone
in
violation
of
a
state
or
local
law
while
operating
22


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
to
that
list
of
specified
offenses.
23


Under
current
law,
a
person
whose
driver’s
license
is
24


revoked
upon
conviction
of
a
second
offense
of
operating
while
25


intoxicated
may
apply
for
a
temporary
restricted
license
45
26


days
after
the
effective
date
of
revocation
if
the
person
27


submitted
to
chemical
testing,
and
90
days
after
revocation
28


if
the
person
refused
testing.
The
issuance
of
a
temporary
29


restricted
license
is
conditioned
upon
the
installation
of
30


an
ignition
interlock
device
on
all
motor
vehicles
owned
31


or
operated
by
the
person.
At
the
end
of
the
period
of
32


revocation,
an
ignition
interlock
device
is
required
for
a
33


period
of
one
year,
unless
a
different
period
is
required
34


by
statute;
however,
an

device
is

H.F.
_____


required
for
reinstatement
if
the
person
had
a
temporary
1


restricted
license
during
the
revocation
period.
The
bill
2


amends
Code
sections
321J.17
and
321J.20
to
provide
that
a
3


person
is
required
to
maintain
an
ignition
interlock
device
4


for
one
year
or
longer
following
reinstatement.
The
one-year
5


period
is
reduced
by
any
period
of
time
the
person
held
a
6


valid
temporary
restricted
license
during
the
revocation
7


for
the
occurrence
from
which
the
arrest
arose.
A
person
8


is
prohibited
from
operating
any
motor
vehicle
not
equipped
9


with
an
ignition
interlock
device
during
the
period
in
which
10


a
device
is
required
to
be
maintained,
and
a
person
must
11


certify
installation
of
an
ignition
interlock
device
before
12


the
department
can
grant
reinstatement.
The
bill
also
strikes
13


a
provision
in
current
law
that
ties
the
permissible
use
of
14


certain
temporary
restricted
licenses
to
uses
permitted
under
15


federal
law.
Finally,
the
bill
strikes
the
current
requirement
16


that
a
person
who
was
issued
a
temporary
restricted
license
17


must
submit
proof
of
deinstallation
of
an
ignition
interlock
18


device
as
a
condition
for
reinstatement
of
a
full
driver’s
19


license.
20


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
321M.9
21


requiring
the
auditor
of
state
to
conduct
periodic
studies
of
22


the
county
driver’s
license
issuance
program.
23


Code
section
321.116,
which
establishes
an
annual
24


registration
fee
of
$25
for
electric
motor
vehicles,
is
25


repealed.
As
a
result,
electric
motor
vehicles
will
be
subject
26


to
registration
fees
based
on
the
weight
and
value
of
the
27


vehicle.
The
change
applies
for
registration
years
beginning
28


on
or
after
January
1,
2014.
29


The
bill
repeals
a
provision
in
1984
Acts,
chapter
1229,
30


that
linked
the
contingent
repeal
of
Code
section
314.14,
as
it
31


existed
at
that
time,
to
the
repeal
or
expiration
of
a
federal
32


statute
relating
to
set-aside
contracts
for
disadvantaged
33


business
enterprises.
Due
to
subsequent
substantive
amendments
34


to
the
Code
section,
the
contingent
repeal
provision
is
