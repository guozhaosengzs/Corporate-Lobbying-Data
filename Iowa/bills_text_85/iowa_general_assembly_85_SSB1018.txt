EXPLANATION

This
bill
relates
to
the
policy
administration
of
the
8


election
and
voter
registration
laws
by
the
secretary
of
state.
9


The
bill
requires
that
the
county
commissioner
of
10


registration
accept
completed
voter
registration
forms
from
11


registrants
who
are
at
least
17
years
of
age.
Current
law
12


requires
the
county
commissioner
of
registration
to
accept
such
13


forms
from
registrants
who
are
at
least
17
and
one-half
years
14


of
age.
These
provisions
of
the
bill
take
effect
January

2014.
16


In
2008,
Code
section
49.21,
relating
to
designation
of
17


polling
places,
eliminated
language
regarding
accessibility
to
18


elderly
persons
and
retained
language
regarding
accessibility
19


to
persons
with
disabilities.
The
bill
strikes
the
same
20


language
referring
to
accessibility
to
elderly
persons
at
21


voting
centers,
to
conform
with
Code
section
49.21.
22


The
bill
requires
that
any
authority
supported
by
taxation
23


under
the
laws
of
Iowa
make
space
available
for
the
training
24


of
precinct
election
officials
and
other
election
personnel
25


upon
the
application
of
the
county
commissioner
of
elections.
26


The
bill
requires
that
the
commissioner
only
schedule
and
