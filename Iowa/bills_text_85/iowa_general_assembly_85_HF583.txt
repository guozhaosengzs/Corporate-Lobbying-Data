EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
contains
provisions
concerning
the
movement
of
23


vehicles
of
excessive
size
and
weight
on
Iowa
roads.
24


Code
section
321.473
is
amended
by
striking
provisions
25


relating
to
annual
permits
for
the
operation
of
compact
rubbish
26


vehicles,
which
are
moved
to
new
Code
section
321E.30.
27


Code
section
321E.1
is
amended
to
provide
that
if
a
vehicle
28


permitted
to
transport
indivisible
loads
has
a
retractable
body
29


extension,
the
extension
must
be
reduced
to
legal
dimensions
30


unless
the
vehicle
is
loaded
and
the
extension
is
in
use.
The
31


bill
allows
persons
requesting
permits
to
do
so
in
person,
32


through
the
internet,
by
facsimile
machine,
or
by
telephone.
33


Currently,
Code
section
321E.2
allows
the
department
of
34


transportation
to
issue
all-systems
permits
for
movements
on

all
highways
or
streets
under
the
jurisdiction
of
either
the
1


state
or
local
authorities
that
have
indicated
in
writing
those
2


streets
or
highways
for
which
an
all-systems
permit
is
not
3


valid.
Under
the
bill,
at
the
request
of
a
local
authority,
4


the
department
shall
also
issue
other
types
of
permits
for
5


streets
under
local
jurisdiction
if
the
local
authority
6


has
indicated
to
the
department
in
writing
those
streets
or
7


highways
where
a
permit
is
not
valid.
The
bill
stipulates
that
8


“in
writing”
includes
electronic
communication.
9


Code
section
321E.7,
which
relates
to
load
limits
per
axle,
10


is
amended
by
making
technical
revisions
to
existing
language
11


and
by
including
the
axle
and
gross
weight
limitations
for
raw
12


milk
transporters
and
compact
rubbish
vehicles
by
reference
13


to
those
provisions,
which
are
found
elsewhere
in
the
Code
14


chapter.
15


Code
section
321E.8,
which
provides
for
the
issuance
of
16


annual
permits,
is
amended
to
provide
that
certain
commercial
17


vehicles
other
than
special
trucks,
which
are
currently
18


allowed
to
operate
at
weight
limits
of
up
to
90,000
pounds
19


with
six
axles,
and
up
to
96,500
pounds
with
seven
axles,
are
20


exempt
from
permitting
requirements
based
on
weight
in
excess
21


of
80,000
pounds.
Currently,
cranes
that
are
used
in
the
22


construction
of
alternative
energy
facilities
and
which
exceed
23


the
20,000
weight
limit
established
under
Code
chapter
321
on
24


any
one
axle
may
be
moved
with
approval
of
the
permit-issuing
25


authority,
without
the
requirement
of
an
annual
permit.
The
26


bill
allows
such
cranes
to
exceed
the
24,000
pound
weight
limit
27


established
under
Code
section
321E.7
for
any
one
axle.
The
28


exemption
is
also
allowed
for
such
cranes
operating
under
a
29


single-trip
permit.
30


Currently,
Code
section
321E.9
provides
that
a
vehicle
31


with
an
indivisible
load,
having
an
overall
width
of
40
feet,
32


overall
length
of
120
feet,
or
a
total
gross
weight
of
100,000
33


pounds
may
be
moved
under
a
single-trip
permit
provided
the
34


gross
weight
on
any
one
axle
does
not
exceed
maximum
weight

limits.
The
height
of
vehicles
and
loads
is
currently
limited
1


by
the
height
of
underpasses,
bridges,
power
lines,
and
other
2


restrictions
on
the
route
specified
in
the
permit.
The
bill
3


strikes
those
provisions
and
instead
provides
that
maximum
4


height,
width,
length,
and
weight
of
vehicles
and
loads
5


operating
under
single-trip
permits
shall
be
limited
to
the
6


maximum
physical
limitations
and
clearances
of
the
roadway
7


and
infrastructure
of
the
intended
route.
Permit-issuing
8


authorities
are
authorized
to
make
the
final
determination
9


regarding
the
issuance
of
single-trip
permits,
based
on
whether
10


the
movement
will
cause
undue
stress
or
damage
to
pavement,
11


bridges,
or
other
highway
infrastructure,
and
taking
into
12


consideration
the
interest
of
public
safety.
13


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321E.9A
to
limit
the
maximum
14


height
allowed
for
a
vehicle
with
an
indivisible
load
moved
15


under
a
multi-trip
permit
to
15
feet,
5
inches.
Current
law
16


does
not
provide
a
height
restriction.
17


Code
section
321E.9B
is
amended
by
making
technical
18


changes
to
the
language
in
the
Code
section
to
conform
to
the
19


terminology
used
throughout
the
Code
chapter.
20


Code
section
321E.10
currently
relates
to
requirements
21


for
annual
trip
permits
for
trucks
and
trailers
manufactured
22


in
Iowa
that
exceed
length
and
width
limits
and
are
moved
23


from
the
point
of
manufacture
or
assembly
to
another
point
of
24


manufacture
or
assembly.
The
bill
amends
the
Code
section
25


by
limiting
its
applicability
to
semitrailers
and
trailers.
26


Current
requirements
for
the
marking
of
vehicles
being
moved
27


for
delivery
or
transfer
purposes
and
accessibility
to
peace
28


officers’

are
stricken.
29


Code
section
321E.11
provides
for
movements
under
permit
30


during
daylight
hours,
with
certain
exceptions,
and
on
31


holidays.
The
Code
section
is
amended
to
specify
that
a
32


permitted
vehicle
with
an
overall

of
not
more
than
100
33

and
an

The

which

4


to

The

may
6


impose

8


Code
section
321E.12
provides
that,
with
certain
exceptions,
9


a
vehicle
traveling
under
permit
must
be
registered
for
the
10


gross
weight
of
the

A

11


exists
to
allow
the

equipment

the
gross
weight
of

amends

exception
to
provide
that
a
private
14


carrier
who
is
not
for
hire
may
transport
special
mobile
15


equipment
on
a

Proration

14


Code
section
321E.16,
which

for
15


violations
of
permit
provisions,
is
amended
to
include
a

for

by
escort
vehicle
operators.
The
bill
17


provides
that
operating

vehicle
in
violation
18


of
administrative
rules
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
19


by
a

of

This
is
the
same
fine
which
is
20


currently
applicable
to
violations
of
Code
chapter
321E,
other
21


than
weight

22

of
certain

and
321E
with
respect
to
the
operation
of

26


by
any
one
permit
holder
constitutes
prima

evidence
27


of
a
willful
violation
of
Code
chapter
321E.
The
bill
adds
28


violations
of
Code
sections
321.256
(obedience

official
29


traffic-control
devices),
321.457

among
other
things,

relating

the

of

The
bill
replaces
2


the
terms
“character

gravity”
with
the
terms
“nature

3


severity”.
4


Code
section
321E.19
is
amended
to
provide
that
a
5


permit-issuing

deny,

6


any

issued
by
the

for

of
local
authorities
may
be
9


appealed
in
accordance
with
the

procedures
of
the

authority.
This
replaces
current
requirements
for

11


before

of
the

body
for
12


permits
issued

before

and
appeals
for
permits
issued
by
the
department
14


of
transportation.
15


Code
section
321E.20
is
amended
by
making
technical
16


changes
to
the
language
in
the
Code
section
to
conform
to
the
17


terminology
used
throughout
the
Code
chapter.
18


Code
section
321E.24
currently
requires
vehicles
of

certain

and
weight
to
carry
a
warning
device
clearly
20


visible
from
a

of
500
feet
to

The

21


replaces
that
requirement
with
a
provision
for
the
adoption
22


by
the
department
of
administrative
rules
regarding
oversize

load
signs,
warning
flags,

25


Code

of

27


Code
section
