EXPLANATION
19


Current
Code
section
317.25
originated
in
1973
when
the
20


56th
General
Assembly
prohibited
the
sale,
offer
for
sale,
21


or
distribution
of
teasel
(Dipsacus)
biennial
or
its
seeds
22


(1973
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
206).
Since
then,
the
general
assembly
23


has
prohibited
the
importation
of
teasel,
as
well
as
the
24


importation,
sale,
offer
for
sale,
or
distribution
of
other
25


plants
or
their
seeds
classified
as
invasive,
including
the
26


multiflora
rose
(Rosa
multiflora),
and
purple
loosestrife
27


(Lythrum
salicaria
or
Lythrum
virgatum).
This
bill
adds
28


oriental
bittersweet
(Celastrus
orbiculatus)
and
its
seeds
to
29


that
list.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
imports,
sells,
30


offers
for
sale,
or
distributes
oriental
bittersweet
is
subject
31


to
the
Code
section’s
existing
fine
of
not
more
than
$100.
