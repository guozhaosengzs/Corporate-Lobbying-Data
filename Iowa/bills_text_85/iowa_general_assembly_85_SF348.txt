This
bill
concerns
the
period
of
validity
of
driver’s
24


licenses
and
nonoperator’s
identification
cards
issued
by
the
25


department
of
transportation.
26


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321.190
to
extend
the
validity
27


of
nonoperator’s
identification
cards
from
five
years
to
28


eight
years,
with
a
corresponding
fee
increase
from
$5
to
29


$8.
The
bill
provides
for
the
issuance
of
a
nonoperator’s
30


identification
card
without
fee
to
a
person
whose
driver’s
31


license
is
voluntarily
surrendered
due
to
the
person’s
32


physical
or
mental
inability

that
provides
for
issuance
of
a
nonexpiring
34


nonoperator’s
identification
card
to
a
person
age
70
or
