two

XIII
to
the
Constitution
of
the
State

Iowa
which
relate
to
11


state
budgets
and
state
revenue.
12


The
first
amendment
creates
a
state
general
fund
expenditure
13


limitation.
The
amount
of
the
limitation
is
99
percent
of
the
14


adjusted
revenue
estimate.
The
amendment
defines
adjusted
15


revenue
estimate
and

be

16


by
a

estimating
conference
which
is
to
be
created
by
17


the
general
assembly
by
law.
The
amendment
requires
that

expenditure
limitation
be

by
the
governor
in
preparation
19


of
the
governor’s
budget
and
by
the
general
assembly
in
the
20


budget
process.
The
governor
is
prohibited
from
approving
or
21


disapproving
of
appropriations
in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
22


final
budget
approved
by
the
governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
23


limitation.
24


The
first
amendment
also
provides
that
if
a
new
revenue
25


source
is
established
and
implemented,
95
percent
of
the
26


estimate
of
that
new
revenue
shall
be
included
in
the
27


expenditure
limitation.
28


The
first
amendment
provides
that
if
there
is
a
surplus
29


existing
at
the
end
of
a
fiscal
year
which
exceeds
10
percent
30


of
the
adjusted
revenue
for
the
fiscal
year
and
the
actual
net
31


revenue
for
the
general
fund
for
the
fiscal
year
exceeds
the
32


adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
fiscal
year,
the
surplus
is
33


required
to
be
transferred
to
a
taxpayers
trust
fund.

34


surplus
which
is
equal

requires
a

In

first
amendment
also
requires
the
state
to

16


assembly
shall

the
amendment.
17


The

the
resolution

the
members
elected
to

amends,
21


or
repeals
the
state
income
tax
or
the
state
sales
and

tax,
and
which
causes,
in
the

30


requirement
must
be
filed
no
later
than
one
year
from

Finally,
the
amendment
provides
32


that
