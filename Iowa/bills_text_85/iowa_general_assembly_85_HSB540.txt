is
unsuccessful
in

receiving

board
during
one
annual
24


application
period,
the

may
apply

provided
the

The
bill
strikes
the
provision
requiring
that
if
a
2


redevelopment
tax
credit
recipient
has
also
applied
to
the
3


state
for
additional
financial
assistance,
the
state
shall
not
4


consider
the
receipt
of
the
tax
credit
when
considering
the

application
for
additional
financial

and

The
bill
amends
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit.
Under
12


current
law,
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit
is
equal
to
a
certain
13


percentage
of
the
investor’s
qualifying
investment
depending
14


on
whether
the
project
is
located
on
a
grayfield
site
or
a
15


brownfield
site
and
whether
or
not
the
project
meets
green
16


development
requirements.
The
bill
provides
that
the
amount
17


of
the
tax
credit
shall
be
an
amount
determined
by
the
board
18


in
conjunction
with
the
council,
but
shall
not
exceed
those
19


percentages
already
provided
under
current
law.
The
bill
20


provides
that
the
amount
of
tax
credit
included
on
a
tax
credit
21


certificate
shall
be
contingent
on
an
award
by
the
board,
and
22


on
the
completion
of
an
audit
of
the
project
which
audit
is
23


already
required
under
Iowa
law.
24


The
bill
requires
agreements
under

An

26


with
the
EDA
concerning
the
qualifying
redevelopment
project.
27


The
bill
amends
language
relating
to
a
taxpayer’s
loss
of
28


any
right
to
a
tax
credit
for
failure
to
comply
with
any
29


requirements,
to
specify
that
if
an

fails
to
comply
30


with
any
requirements
of
the
agreement,
the
authority
may
find

the

agreement,
the
bill
provides
that
such
recovery
shall
be
in
1


the
same
manner
as
provided
in
Code
section
15.330,

The
bill
amends
the
process
of
claiming
the
tax
credits
5


by
allowing
the
currently
nonrefundable
tax
credits
to
be
6


refundable,
but
only
to
nonprofit
organizations
under
certain
7


conditions.
In
order
for
tax
credits
to
qualify
as
refundable,
8


a
nonprofit
organization
must
be
an
investor
applying
for
9


the
tax
credits,
must
be
organized
under
Code
chapter
504,
10


must
qualify
as
a
tax-exempt
organization
under
section
11


501(c)(3)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code,
and
must
establish
12


these
requirements
during
the
tax
credit
application
process.
13


The
EDA
will
be
required
to
indicate
on
the
tax
credit
14


certificate
issued
to
these
nonprofit
organizations
that
such
15


requirements
have
been
met.
The
bill
requires
that
a
taxpayer
16


include,
rather
than
attach,
a
tax
credit
certificate
with
the
17


taxpayer’s
tax
return.
The
bill
amends
the
requirement
that
18


tax
credits
shall
not
be
claimed
for
taxable
years
beginning
19


prior
to
July
1,
2009,
to
require
that
tax
credits
shall
not
20


be
claimed
prior
to
the
tax
year
listed
on
the
tax
credit

certificate.

The
bill
strikes
Code
section
15.293A,
subsections
10

23


11,
relating
to
the
adoption
of
administrative

the
DOR,

the
EDA’s
cooperation
with
the
department
25


of
natural
resources
and
local
governments
regarding
the
26


dissemination
of

about
the

The

27


requires
the
authority,
in
conjunction
with
the
department
28


of
revenue,
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
the

The
29


bill
transfers
to
Code
section
15.293B
the
language
from
30


Code
section
15.293A,
subsection
8,
relating
to
the

31


for

of

upon
