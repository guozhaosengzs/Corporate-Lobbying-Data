for
dogs
that
are
less
than
six
28


months
old,
dogs
kept

and
dogs
that
are
in
transit
30


or
assigned
to
research
institutions
(Code

31


Licensed
veterinarians,
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
32


stewardship,
and
local
authorities,
such
as
cities,
share
33


responsibility
for
regulating
and
enforcing
rabies
security
34


measures.

must
issue
a
certificate
of
vaccination
and
rabies
vaccination
1


tag
to
the
dog’s
owner
(Code
section
351.35),
the
department
2


must
set
standards
for
vaccines
(Code
section
351.35),
and
a
3


local
authority
has
general
enforcement
authority
including
the
4


power
to
seize
and
impound
dogs
(Code
sections
351.26,
351.36,
5


351.37,
351.39,
and
351.40).
In
addition,
a
local
authority
6


may
adopt
additional
measures
to
restrict
not
only
dogs
but
7


other
animals
(such
as
cats
or
ferrets)
as
necessary
to
control
8


rabies
(Code
section
351.41).

NEW
EXEMPTION
FOR
ANIMALS
THREATENED
BY
INJECTIONS.
This
10


bill
provides
a
new
exemption
from
rabies
vaccination
11


requirements
for
animals
whose
life
or
health
would
be
12


threatened
by
a
vaccination
as
determined
by
a
licensed
13


veterinarian.
The
veterinarian
making
such
determination
14


must
issue
a
rabies
vaccination
exemption
certificate
and
15


rabies
vaccination
exemption
tag
to
the
animal’s
owner.
The
16


certificate
and
tag
remain
valid
for
one
year
but
may
be
17


renewed
on
an
annual
basis.
18


PROVISIONS
REMAINING
APPLICABLE.
Provisions
governing
dogs
19


which
have
been
vaccinated
apply
to
dogs
which
are
exempt
from
20


vaccination.
For
example,
a
person
could
still
kill
a
dog
21


exempt
from
vaccination
requirements
for
chasing
livestock
22


just
as
the
person
may
kill
a
dog
wearing
a
vaccination
tag
23


(Code
section
351.27).
A
local
authority
could
apprehend
and
24


impound
a
dog
running
at
large
even
if
the
dog
wore
a
rabies
25


vaccination
exemption
tag
just
as
it
could
impound
a
dog
26


running
at
large
without
a
tag
(Code
section
351.37).
27


CRIMINAL
PENALTY.
A
person
who
fails
to
comply
with
the
28


applicable
provisions
governing
rabies
vaccination
requirements
29


is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
(Code
section
351.43).
A
30


simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
31


than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
32


or
by
both.
