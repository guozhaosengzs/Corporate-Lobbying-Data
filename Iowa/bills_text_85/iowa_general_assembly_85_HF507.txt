EXPLANATION
4


This
bill
provides
for
the
registration
of
all-terrain
5


vehicles
for
operation
on
certain
Iowa
roads.
6


Code
section
321.1
defines
“all-terrain
vehicle”
as
a
motor
7


vehicle
designed
to
travel
on
three
or
more
wheels
and
designed
8


primarily
for
off-road
recreational
use.
The
definition
9


includes
off-road
utility
vehicles,
but
excludes
farm
tractors
10


or
equipment,
construction
equipment,
forestry
vehicles,
11


and
lawn
and
grounds
maintenance
vehicles.
Currently,
the
12


department
of
natural
resources
regulates
all-terrain
vehicles
13


for
purposes
of
off-road
recreational
use.
All-terrain
14


vehicles
are
not
permitted
on
Iowa
roads,
except
under
limited
15


circumstances.
16


Under
the
bill,
the
owner
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
designed
17


to
travel
on
four
or
more
wheels
may
register
the
vehicle
with
18


the
department
of
transportation
by
applying
for
a
certificate
19


of
title
and
registration
from
the
county
treasurer.
The
20


annual
registration
fee
is
$50.
The
size
of
license
plates
21


to
be
issued
for
all-terrain
vehicles
will
be
determined
22


by
the
department
of
transportation.
Because
all-terrain
23


vehicles
are
currently
subject
to
sales
tax,
the
bill
provides
24


that
all-terrain
vehicles
are
exempt
from
the
fee
for
new
25


registration
imposed
on
vehicles
subject
to
registration,
26


so
long
as
the
owner
has
paid
the
Iowa
sales
tax
or
the
27


appropriate
tax
in
another
state
at
the
time
of
purchase.
28


Registration
with
the
department
of
transportation
does
not
29


exempt
the
owner
from
the
current
requirement
to
register
the
30


all-terrain
vehicle
with
the
department
of
natural
resources,
31


but
if
the
owner
obtains
a
certificate
of
title
from
the
32


department
of
transportation,
the
owner
does
not
have
to
repeat
33


that
process
when
registering
the
vehicle
with
the
department
34


of
natural
resources.
The
owner
may
submit
the
certificate
35

of
title
issued
for
the
vehicle
by
the
department
of
natural
1


resources
as
proof
of
ownership
when
registering
an
all-terrain
2


vehicle
with
the
department
of
transportation.
Under
the
3


bill,
a
manufacturer’s
label
certifying
that
the
vehicle
meets
4


federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
is
not
required
for
5


registration
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle.
6


The
bill
provides
that
an
all-terrain
vehicle
registered
7


with
the
department
of
transportation
may
be
operated
on
8


secondary
roads,
but
not
on
primary
highways,
except
to
9


cross
over
a
primary
highway,
and
not
on
highways
within
the
10


corporate
limits
of
a
city
except
where
all-terrain
vehicles
11


are
permitted
by
ordinance.
Under
the
bill,
a
city
may
12


authorize
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
registered
13


with
the
department
of
transportation
on
highways
under
the
14


city’s
jurisdiction
other
than
municipal
extensions
of
primary
15


highways.
The
bill
strikes
current
provisions
in
Code
chapter
16


321I
that
allow
cities
and
counties
to
designate
roads
under
17


their
jurisdiction
for
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
18


registered
with
the
department
of
natural
resources.
19


The
bill
states
that
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
20


vehicle
on
a
highway
must
be
at
least
16
years
of
age
and
have
21


a
valid
driver’s
license
other
than
a
license
valid
only
for
22


the
operation
of
a
motorized
bicycle.
Iowa
motor
vehicle
laws
23


apply
to
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
24


except
those
equipment
provisions
which
by
their
nature
can
25


have
no
practical
application.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
26


operator
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
must
carry
proof
of
motor
27


vehicle
financial
liability
coverage,
and
the
all-terrain
28


vehicle
must
meet
requirements
for
headlamps,
rear
lamps,
29


and
turn
signals.
Current
speed
limits
apply
to
all-terrain
30


vehicles
operated
on
a
highway,
except
that
an
all-terrain
31


vehicle
may
not
be
operated
at
a
speed
exceeding
45
miles
per
32


hour.
33


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“motor
vehicles
subject
to
34


registration”
for
purposes
of
the
exemption
from
the
sales
and

highways,
in
order
to
2


continue
the
applicability
of
the
sales
tax
to

vehicles.
3


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
4


vehicle
on
a
highway
in
violation
of
current
restrictions
5


commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
6


of
$50.
The
bill
establishes
the
same
penalty
for
a
person
7


who
operates
a
registered
all-terrain
vehicle
in
violation
of
8


minimum
age
and

requirements
or

where
