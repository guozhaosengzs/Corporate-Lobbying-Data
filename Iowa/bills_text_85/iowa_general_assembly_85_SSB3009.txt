to

EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
contains
various
revisions
to
Code
provisions
20


relating
to
the
practice
of
nursing.
The
bill
requires
21


advanced
registered
nurse
practitioners
to
be
licensed
by
the
22


board
of
nursing
rather
than
registered,
and
authorizes
the
23


professional
abbreviation
“A.R.N.P.”
24


Current
Code
language
authorizes
licensed
practical
nurses
25


and
registered
nurses
to
perform
acts
or
nursing
specialties
26


which
are
recognized
by
the
medical
and
nursing
professions
27


and
are
approved
by
the
board.
The
bill
eliminates
this
28


provision
and
provides
that
the
regulation
of
nursing
is
the
29


authority
and
responsibility
of
the
board
to
determine
which
30


acts
or
specialties
may
be
performed
by
a
nurse,
commensurate
31


with
the
nurse’s
education,
continuing
education,
demonstrated
32


competencies
and
experience.
33


The
bill
specifies
the
purposes
for
which
licensing
fees
34


which
are
treated
as
return
receipts
may
be
used
by
the
board.

The

separates
the
provision
on
education
programs
and

student
records
into
two
Code
sections.

Currently,
the
board
of
nursing
may
request
a
nurse
who
is
3


a
licensee
to
submit
to
an
appropriate
medical
examination.
4


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
the
board
pay
the
5


reasonable
costs
for
such
examinations
and
medical
reports.
