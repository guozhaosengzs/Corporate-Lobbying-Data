This

establishes
contribution
limits
for
candidates
who
do
not
27


participate
in
the
public
financing
process.
28


The
bill
enacts
a

30


providing
definitions
for
key
terms
related
to
this
process.
31


New
Code
section
68A.823
establishes
a
separate,
32


nonreverting
fund
in
the
state
treasury
to

clean
elections
fund
(VOICE),
and
new
Code
34


section
