and
by
qualified
small
employers
in
the
small
group
market.
1


The
intent
of
establishing
such
a
marketplace
is
to
reduce
2


the
number
of
uninsured
individuals
in
this
state,
provide
a
3


transparent
marketplace
and
consumer
education,
and
assist
4


individuals
with
access
to
relevant
federal
and
state
programs,
5


premium
assistance
tax
credits,
and
cost-sharing
reductions.
6


For
purposes
of
the
bill,
a
qualified
employer
that
can
7


participate
in
the
small
business
health
options
program
8


component
of
the
marketplace
is
an
employer
that
employs
an
9


average
of
at
least
one
and
not
more
than
50
employees
during
10


the
preceding
calendar
year
and
elects
to
make
its
full-time
11


employees,
and
at
the
employer’s
option,
some
or
all
of
its
12


part-time
employees,
eligible
for
one
or
more
qualified
health
13


benefit
plans
offered
through
the
small
business
health
options
14


program
component
of
the
marketplace.
A
qualified
employer
15


must
either
have
its
principal
place
of
business
in
this
state
16


and
elect
to
provide
health
coverage
through
the
marketplace
to
17


all
of
its
eligible
employees
wherever
employed,
or
elect
to
18


provide
coverage
through
the
marketplace
to
all
of
its
eligible
19


employees
who
are
principally
employed
in
this
state.
20


The
Iowa
health
benefit
marketplace
is
established
as
a
21


nonprofit
corporation.
The
marketplace
shall
be
operated
on
22


a
statewide

pursuant
to
a
plan
of

by
its
board
of
directors
in

24


with
the

of

The

shall
25


include
separate
components
which
facilitate
the
purchase
of

qualified
health

by
eligible
individuals
and
27


small
employers
as
described
in
new
Code
chapter
514M
and
the
28


federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act,
as
amended.
29


The
marketplace
may
employ
staff
to
carry
out
its
duties
but
30


no
employees
of
the
marketplace
may
offer
services
for
which
31


a
license
as
an
insurance
producer
is
required
pursuant
to
32


Code
chapter
522B.
The
marketplace
is
also
authorized
to

contract
with
an
eligible
entity
to
fulfill
any
of
its
duties
34


or
