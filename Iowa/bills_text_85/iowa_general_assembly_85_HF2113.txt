“Reasonable

circumstances,
would
judge
to
5


be
necessary
to
prevent
an
injury
or
loss
and
can
include
6


deadly
force
if
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
such
force
is
7


necessary
to
avoid
injury
or
risk
to
one’s
life
or
safety
or
8


the
life
or
safety
of
another,
or
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
9


that
such
force
is
necessary
to
resist
a
like
force
or
threat.
10


2.
Reasonable
force,
including
deadly
force,
may
be
used
11


even
if

alternative
entails
a
risk
to
life
or
safety,
or
the
life
or
13


safety
of
a
third
party
,
or
requires
one
to
abandon
or
retreat
14


from
one’s
dwelling
or
place
of
business
or
employment
.
15

A
person
may
be
wrong
in
the
estimation
of
the
danger
or
16


the
force
necessary
to
repel
the
danger
as
long
as
there
is
a


17


reasonable
basis
for
the
belief
of
the
person
and
the
person
18


acts
reasonably
in
the
response
to
that
belief.
19


4.
A
person
who
is
not
engaged
in
illegal
activity
has
no
20


duty
to
retreat
from
any
place
where
the
person
is
lawfully


21


present
before
using
force
as
specified
in
this
chapter.


22


A
finder
of
fact
shall
not
be
permitted
to
consider
the
23


possibility
of
retreat
as
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
24


not
a
person
who
used
force
reasonably
believed
that
the
force


25


was
necessary
to
prevent
injury,
loss,
or
risk
to
life
or


26


safety.
27


Sec.
