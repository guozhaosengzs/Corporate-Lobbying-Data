WHEREAS,
1,000

WHEREAS,
the
federal
production
tax
credit
for
wind
1


energy
has
fostered
innovation
in
the

energy
2


industry
and
will
encourage
further
innovation
if
3


extended;
and
4


WHEREAS,
the
federal
production
tax
credit
for
wind
5


energy
provides
a
2.2
percent

credit
for
the
first
10
years
of
electricity
production
7


from
utility-scale
wind
turbines;
and
8


WHEREAS,
the
federal
production
tax
credit
for
9


wind
energy
has
repeatedly
been
allowed
to
sunset
and
10


then
extended
since
its
original
enactment,
which
has
11


contributed
to
a
boom-bust
cycle
of
development
that
12


has
been
detrimental
to
the
wind
industry;
and
13


WHEREAS,
the
federal
production

17


credit

energy,
preferably
for
a
multiple-year
18


period
to
maximize
the
benefits
of
the
production
tax
19


credit;
and
20


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
copies
of
this
21


resolution
be
sent
to
the
members
of

and
to
the
President

States.
