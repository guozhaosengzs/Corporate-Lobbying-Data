The
date
is
extended
from
July

2012,
to
21


July
1,
2013.
The
bill
provides
that
if
additional
nameplate
22


generating
capacity
becomes
available
within
the
50
megawatt
23


maximum
capacity
restrictions
for
qualified
facilities
pursuant
24


to
Code
section
476B.5,
subsection
4,
the
amount

Additionally,
with
regard
to
the
renewable
energy
tax
4


credit,
currently
the

of
all
wind
energy
conversion
facilities
the
board
6


may
find
eligible
shall
not
exceed
363
megawatts.
The
bill
7


provides
that

The
bill
specifies
that
of
this
10


maximum
capacity,
five
megawatts
shall

12


zones
created
under
Code
section
476.48.
Further,
currently
13


the

find
eligible
15


shall
not
exceed
a
combined
output
of
53
