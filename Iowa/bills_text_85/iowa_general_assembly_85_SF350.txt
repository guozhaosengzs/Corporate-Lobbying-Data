EXPLANATION
26


This
bill
relates
to
mandatory
child
abuse
and
dependent
27


adult
abuse
reporter
training.
The
bill
eliminates
the
abuse
28


education
review
panel,
a
panel
established
by
the
department
29


of
public
health.
The
abuse
education
review
panel
was
30


established
to
review
and
approve
mandatory
reporter
training
31


curricula.
The
bill
instead
transfers
this
responsibility
32


to
the
department
of
public
health
and
also
requires
the
33


department
to
review
and
approve
trainers
for
the
new
34


interactive
training
requirement
for
mandatory
reporters
of

of
stakeholders
to

2


revisions
to
curricula.

The
bill
adds
an
additional
one-time
training
requirement
4


for
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse.
Between
24
and
36
5


months
after
initial
employment
or
self-employment,
a
mandatory
6


reporter
must
complete
a
90-minute
interactive
training.
The
7


bill
requires
the
department
of
public
health
to
approve
the
8


trainers
for
this
interactive
training.
The
other
training
9


requirements
for
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
remain
the
10


same
under
the
bill.
11


The
bill
states
that
the
interactive
training
requirement
12


applies
to
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
who
begin
initial
13
