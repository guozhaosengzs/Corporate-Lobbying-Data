1.
It
is
declared
that
policyholders
of
a
mutual
company
2


have
contractual
rights
to
insurance
coverage
and
certain
3


membership
rights
consisting
principally
of
the
right
to
4


elect
directors
of
a
mutual
company,
the
right
to
vote
on
5


certain
fundamental
transactions
undertaken
by
a
mutual
6


company,
and
the
right
to
share
in
surplus
in
the
event
of
a
7


liquidation
of
a
solvent
mutual
company.
It
is
declared
that
8


the
membership

of
policyholders
in

or
policyholders
of
a
foreign
mutual
company
who
vote
10


to
redomesticate
to
Iowa
pursuant
to
section
512.5,
are
not
11


equivalent
to
an
ownership
interest
in
such
mutual
company.
12


Therefore,
in
connection
with
the
mutual-to-stock
conversion
of
13


a
mutual
company,
adequate
compensation
for
the
relinquishment
14


of
such
membership
right
shall
be,
at
each
policyholder’s
15


election
either
of
the
following:
16


a.
The
exercise
of
a
first
priority
subscription
right
to
17


purchase
stock
in
the
converting
company
or
a
holding
company
18


for
such
converting
company.

The

receive
cash
in

right
by

2.
The
purpose
of
this

shall
be
the
following:
22


a.
To
provide
for
the
mutual-to-stock
conversion
of
a
23


mutual
company
in
a
manner
substantially
consistent
with
the
24


manner
in
which
a
mutual
savings
institution
converts
from
a
25


mutual-to-stock
form
under
federal
law
and
regulation.
26


b.
To
facilitate
the
recapitalization
of
the
insurance
27


industry
nationally
by
establishing
a
proven
method
of
capital
28


formation
for
companies
that
elect
to
establish
a
domicile
in
29


this

subdivision

(2)
A
provision
that
the
subscription
rights
shall
be
2


allocated
in
whole
shares
among
the
eligible
members
using
a
3


fair
and
equitable
formula.
The
formula
need
not
allocate
4


subscription
rights
to
eligible
members
on
a
pro
rata
basis
5


based
on
premium
payments
or
contributions
to
surplus,
but
6


may
take
into
account
how
the
different
classes
of
policies
7


of
the
eligible
members
contributed
to
the
surplus
of
the
8


mutual
company
or
any
other
factors
that
may
be
fair
or
9


equitable.
Allocation
of
subscription
rights
on
a
per
capita
10


basis
shall
be
entitled
to
a
presumption
that
such
method
is
11


fair,
subject
to
rebuttal
of
fairness
by
clear
and
convincing
12


evidence.
In
accordance
with
section
512.4,
subsection
5,
the
13


commissioner
may
retain
an
independent
consultant
to
assist
in
14


the
determination
that
the
allocation
of
subscription
rights
15


is
fair
and
equitable.
16


2.
The
plan
shall
provide
a
fair
and
equitable
means
17


for
allocating
shares
of
capital
stock
in
the
event
of
an
18


oversubscription
to
shares
by
eligible
members
exercising
19


subscription
rights
received
under
subsection
1,
paragraph
“c”
.
20


3.
The
plan
shall
provide
that
any
shares
of
capital
stock
21


not
subscribed
to
by
eligible
members
exercising
subscription
22


rights
received
under
subsection
1,
paragraph
“c”
,
shall
be
23


sold
in
a
public
offering
or
to
another
corporation
or
entity
24


that
is
participating
in
the
plan,
as
provided
in
subsection
25


1,
paragraph
“c”
,
subparagraph
(1).
If
the
number
of
shares
of
26


capital
stock
not
subscribed
by
eligible
members
is
so
small
in
27


number
or
other
factors
exist
that
do
not
warrant
the
time
or
28


expense
of
a
public
offering,
or
warrant
the
participation
of
29


standby
investors
to
facilitate
completion
of
the
conversion,
30


the
plan
may
provide
for
sale
of
the
unsubscribed
shares
31


through
a
private
placement
or
other
alternative
method
32


approved
by
the
commissioner
that
is
fair
and
equitable
to

eligible
members.

by
a
qualified
independent
expert
that
establishes
all
of
the
1


following:
2


a.
The
dollar
amount
of
the
capital
stock
for
which
3


subscription
rights
must
be
granted
pursuant
to
subsection
1,
4


paragraph
“c”
,
which
shall
be
equal
to
the
estimated
pro
forma
5


market
value
of
the
converted
stock
company.
The
qualified
6


independent
expert
may
do
all
of
the
following:
7


(1)
To
the
extent
feasible,
determine
the
pro
forma
market
8


value
by
reference
to
a
peer
group
of
stock
companies
and
the
9


application
of
generally
accepted
valuation
techniques.
10


(2)
State
the
pro
forma
market
value
of
the
converted
stock
11


company
as
a
range
of
value.
12


(3)
Establish
the
value
as
the
value
that
is
estimated
to
be
13


necessary
to
attract
full
subscription
for
the
shares.
14


b.
The
dollar
value
of
a
subscription
right
based
upon
15


the
application
of
the
Black-Scholes
option
pricing
model
or
16


another
generally
accepted
option
pricing
model.
In
connection
17


with
the
determination
of
stock
price
volatility
or
other
18


valuation
inputs
used
in
option
pricing
models,
the
qualified
19


independent
expert
may
assume
that
the
attributes
of
the
20


converted
stock
company
will
be
substantially
similar
to
the
21


attributes
of
the
stock
of
the
peer
companies
used
to
determine
22


the
estimated
pro
forma
market
value
of
the
converted
stock
23


company.
Solely
for
purposes
of
determining
the
value
of
a
24


subscription
right,
the
term
of
a
subscription
right
shall
be
25


deemed
to
be
a
minimum
of
ninety
days.
26


5.
The
plan
shall
provide
that
each
eligible
member
27


shall
be
given
the
right
to
require
the
mutual
company
to
28


redeem
such
subscription
rights,
in
lieu
of
the
exercise
of
29


subscription
rights
allocated
to
such
eligible
member,
at
a
30


price
equal
to
the
number
of
such

allocated
31


to
such

multiplied
by
the

value
of
a
32

right
as
determined
by
the
qualified
independent
33


expert
pursuant
to
subsection
4,

The

The

eligible

shall
be
paid
to

within

thirty
days
of

Alternatively,

the

not

to,
offer
each

the
option
of
receiving
the
6


redemption
amount
in
cash
or
having
such
redemption
amount
7


credited
against

premium
payments.
An
eligible
member
8


that
does
not
exercise
such
eligible
member’s
subscription
9


rights
and
also
fails
to
affirmatively
request
redemption
10


of
such
subscription
rights
before
the
expiration
of
the

subscription
offering,
nevertheless
shall
be
deemed
to
have

requested
redemption
of
such
eligible

rights
and
shall
receive
the
redemption
amount
in
cash
in
the
14


manner
otherwise
provided
in
this
subsection.
15


6.
The
plan
shall
set
the
purchase
price
per
share
of
16


capital
stock
equal
to
any
reasonable
amount.
However,
the
17


minimum
subscription
amount
required
of
any
eligible
member
18


cannot
exceed
five
hundred
dollars,
but
the
plan
may
provide
19


that
the
minimum
number
of
shares
any

may
purchase
20


pursuant
to
the

is
twenty-five
shares.
The
purchase
price
21


per

at
which
capital
stock
is
offered
to
persons
who
are
22


not
eligible
members
may
be
greater
than
but
not
less
than
the
23


purchase
price
per
share
at
which
capital
stock
is
offered
to
24


eligible
members.
25


7.
The
plan
shall
provide
that
any
person
or
group
of
26


persons
acting
in
concert
shall
not
acquire,
in
the
public

offering
