The
section
of
this
Act
amending
section
256.16,
22


subsection
1,
paragraph
“a”,
subparagraph
(2).
23


EXPLANATION
24


This
bill
modifies
practitioner
preparation
program
25


requirements
specified
in
Code
section
256.16.
The
programs
26


are
currently
approved
by
the
state
board
of
education.
27


Currently,
the
programs
are
required
to
administer
subject
28


assessments
and
performance-based
assessments.
The
bill
29


requires
that
the
performance-based
assessments
must
be
30


discipline-specific,
rather
than
subject-area
specific;
and
31


allows
practitioner
preparation
programs
to
determine
whether
32


to
administer
the
subject
and
pedagogy
or
the
performance-based
33


assessments
to
a
student.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
34


requires
students
to
achieve
a
score
above
the
25th
percentile

These
provisions
take

2014.

The
bill
also
requires
the
programs
to
work
with
the
board
of
3


educational
examiners
to
develop
valid
and
reliable
pathways
to
4


licensure
by
subject
area
and
allows
students
to
choose
which
5


pathway
to
pursue.
6


The
bill
establishes
a
council
on
pathways
to
licensure,
7


attached
to
the
board
of
educational
examiners,
to
identify
8


appropriate
levels
of
proficiency
in
each
licensure
pathway
9


and

levels
of
proficiency
in
each
10


licensure
pathway.
The

director
of
the
11


department

four-year
staggered
terms

the
executive
13


director

of
educational
examiners

represent
14


the
practitioner
preparation
programs
offered
by
the
regents
15


universities

programs
16

by

private
institutions.
17

of
educational
examiners
shall

18


assistance
and
administrative

council.
19


The
council
shall
assist
both
the
board
of
educational
20


examiners
and
the
state
board
in
resolving
issues
which
are
21


directly
related
to
pathways
to
licensure
and
practitioner
22


preparation
programs.
The
council
shall
formulate
23


recommendations
on
any
issue
referred
to
it
by
those
boards
24


and

specified
time
25


periods.
The
council
shall
