22


This

to

the

26


Several

1


that

will
qualify
if
it
is
a
party
to
a
reorganization
6


that
was
entirely
or
substantially
tax
free
as
long
as
the
7


reorganization
occurred
during
or
after
the
employee-owner’s
8


employment.
9


The
election
shall
also
apply
to
all
subsequent
sales
of
the
10


elected
capital
stock,
provided
it
is
capital
stock
in
the
same
11


qualified
corporation
and
was
acquired
by
the
employee-owner
12


on
account
of
employment
by
the
corporation
and
while
employed
13


by
the
corporation.
14


The
bill
provides
that
the
election
applies
to
transfers
of
15


the
capital
stock
by
inter
vivos
gift
from
the
employee-owner
16


to
a
spouse
or
lineal
descendant,
or
to
a
trust
for
the
benefit
17


of
the
employee-owner’s
spouse
or
lineal
descendant.
The
18


election
will
apply
to
a
spouse
only
if
the
spouse
was
married
19


to
the
employee-owner
on
the
date
of
the
sale
or
the
date
of
the
20


employee-owner’s
death.
21


If,
after
making
a
valid
inter
vivos
transfer
of
stock
that
22


meets
all
the
requirements
for
an
election,
an
employee-owner
23


dies
without
making
an
election,
the
surviving
spouse,
or
if
24


there
is
no
surviving
spouse,
the
personal
representative
of
25


the
employee-owner’s
estate
may
make
the
election.
26


An
election
is
made
by
including
a
written
statement
27


containing
certain
required
information,
as
specified
in
the
28


bill,
with
the
taxpayer’s
Iowa
income
tax
return
for
the
29


taxable
year
in
which
the
election
is
made.
The
department
of
30


revenue
is
required
to
provide
appropriate
forms
for
making
31


elections
and
reporting
exclusions.
32


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
33


retroactively
to
January
1,
2014,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
34


or
after
that
date.
