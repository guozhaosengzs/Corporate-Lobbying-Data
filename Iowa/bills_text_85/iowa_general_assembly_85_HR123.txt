A

all

Congress,
the

governors,
and
state
attorneys
general
to
effectuate
5


the
repeal
of
California
legislation
enacted
as
AB
6


1437
that
unconstitutionally
infringes
upon
the
7


Commerce
Clause
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
8


States
to
the
detriment
of
this
nation’s
consumers
9


and
farmers.
10


WHEREAS,
in
2008,
California
voters
approved
11


Proposition

that
prohibits
12

from
employing
a
number
of
13


agricultural
production
methods
in
widespread
use
14


throughout
the

WHEREAS,
in
2010,
in
response
to
the
proposition
1


which
would
have
placed
California
in
a
competitive
2


disadvantage
by
increasing
the
cost
of
egg
production
3


within
that
state,
the
California
State
Legislature
4


enacted
AB
1437
which
requires
other
states
to
comply
5


with
California’s
standards
in
order
to
continue
to
6


market
eggs
in
that
state;
and
7


WHEREAS,
Section
25996
of
the
California
Health
and
8


Safety
Code
states
that
commencing
January
1,
2015,
a
9


shelled
egg
cannot
be
sold
or
contracted
to
sell
for
10


human
consumption
in
California
if
the
egg
was
produced
11


on
a
farm
not
meeting
California
standards;
and
12


WHEREAS,
the
effect
of
California’s
legislation
is
13


to
increase
consumer
prices,
create
financial
hardship
14


on
low-income
families,
and
deny
egg
farmers
their
15


right
to
access
the
nation’s
markets;
and
16


WHEREAS,
the
“Commerce
Clause,”
Article
I,
17


Section
8
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
18


provides
in
relevant
part,
that
“Congress
shall
have
19


Power...
[t]o
regulate
commerce...
among
the
several
20


States...”;
which
has
established
a
free
trade
zone
now
21


encompassing
fifty
states,
the
District
of
Columbia,
22


and
the
territories
of
the
United
States;
and
23


WHEREAS,
the
Commerce
Clause
is
an
enumerated
power
24


granted
to
Congress
and
is
also
a
restriction
imposed
25


on
states
from
enacting
legislation
that
places
an
26


undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce;
and
27


WHEREAS,
in
Federalist
No.
11,
Alexander
Hamilton
28


understood
that
“a
free
circulation
of
the
commodities”
29


among
the
states
constituted
a
vital
component
of
this

nation’s

and
1


WHEREAS,
since
1824,
in
the
landmark
decision
2


Gibbons
v.
Ogden,
22
U.S.
(9
Wheat.)
1
(1824),
the
3


United
States
Supreme
Court
has
found
that
states
4


are
limited
in
their
ability
to
burden
interstate
5


commerce;
and
6


WHEREAS,
since
then
the
principle
has
been
long
7


respected
that
the
Commerce
Clause
bars
states
from
8


erecting
trade
barriers
that
would
otherwise
inevitably
9


lead
to
interstate
trade
wars,
incite
retaliation
among
10


the
states,
and
ultimately
irreparably
injure
our
11


federal
union;
and
12


WHEREAS,
on
February
3,
2014,
the
Honorable
