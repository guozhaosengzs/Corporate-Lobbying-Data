H.F.

would
require
transition
under
the
Medicaid
program
of
the
1


provision
by
individual
providers
of
personal
care
under
the
2


consumer-directed
attendant
care
option
to
agency-provided
3


personal
care
services
while
retaining
the
consumer
choice
4


option
for
those
individuals
able
and
desiring
to
self-direct
5


services.
Because
the
provision
was
included
in
the
6


appropriation
for
the
Medicaid
program
for
FY
2013-2014
and
7


continued
in
FY
2014-2015,
the
bill
eliminates
the
initial
8


directive
for
FY
2013-2014,
and
directs
the
department
of
human
9


services
not
to
implement
the
strategy
for
FY
2014-2015.
10


The
bill
also
provides
that
under
the
consumer-directed
11


attendant
care
program,
a
guardian
or
attorney
in
fact
under
12


a
durable
power
of
attorney
for
health
care
for
a
program
13


member
may
be
a
provider
of
services
under
the
program.
14


Additionally,
payment
to
such
guardian
or
attorney
in
fact
for
15


health
care
for
a
program
member
acting
as
a
provider
under
16


the
consumer-directed
attendant
care
program
is
not
to
be
17


considered
funds
incorrectly
paid.
18


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
is
retroactively
19


applicable
to
July
1,
2013.
