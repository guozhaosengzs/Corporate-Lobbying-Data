EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
creates
the
“Iowa
Common
Interest
Ownership
Act,”
22


new
Code
chapter
499C.
The
bill
provides
that
it
is
the
23


public
policy
of
the
state
that
the
management
and
affairs
of
24


common
interest
communities
be
conducted
openly
and
that
the
25


new
Code
chapter
is
to
be
construed
to
provide
open
access
to
26


the
management
of
the
common
interest
community
for
the
unit
27


owners.
28


New
Code
chapter
499C
defines
“common
interest
community”
29


to
mean
real
estate
described
in
a
declaration
with
respect
to
30


which
a
person,
by
virtue
of
the
person’s
ownership
of
a
unit,
31


is
obligated
to
pay
for
a
share
of
real
estate
taxes,
insurance
32


premiums,
maintenance,
or
improvement
of,
or
services
or
other
33


expenses
related

specifies

H.F.
122


that
a
common
interest
community
does
not
include
a
covenant
1


that
requires
the
owners
of
separate
parcels
of
real
estate
2


to
share
certain
costs
or
other
obligations,
unless
all
such
3


owners
consent
in
writing
to
the
creation
of
a
common
interest
4


community,
and
does
not
include
community
where
all
units
are
5


owned
by
a
single
unit
owner.
6


The
bill
defines
cooperatives
under
Code
chapter
499A
and
7


horizontal
property
regimes
under
Code
chapter
499B
to
be
8


common
interest
communities.
The
bill
specifies
that
unless
9


otherwise
provided
by
law
new
Code
chapter
499C
applies
to
10


all
common
interest
communities
established
within
this
state
11


having
eight
or
more
units.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
12


for
horizontal
property
regimes
with
seven
or
less
apartments,
13


if
the
form
of
administration
is
a
board
of
administration,
the
14


board
of
administration
must
comply
with
the
requirements
of
15


new
Code
section
499C.401(2),
regarding
meeting
requirements,
16


and
new
Code
sections
499C.402
and
499C.403,
relating
to
17


records
and
notice.
18


The
bill
does
not,
except
as
specifically
provided,
allow
19


for
the
provisions
of
new
Code
chapter
499C
to
be
varied
by
20


agreement,
and
rights
conferred
by
new
Code
chapter
499C
may
21


not
be
waived.
22


The
bill
also
provides
that
any
portion
of
a
declaration,
23


bylaws,
covenant,
or
other
contractual
provision
existing
24


prior
to
July
1,
2013,
that
violates
or
is
inconsistent
with
25


new
Code
chapter
499C
is
not
enforceable.
However,
nothing
in
26


new
Code
chapter
499C
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate
other
27


provisions
of
the
declaration,
bylaws,
plats,
or
plans
of
those
28


common
interest
communities
established
before
July
1,
2013.
29


The
bill
specifies
that
the
provisions
of
new
Code
chapter
30


499C
shall
prevail
over
any
conflicting
provision
of
law
under
31


which
a
common
interest
community
or
unit
owners
association
32


is
organized.
33


The
bill
requires
each
unit
owners
association,
as
defined
34


in
the
bill,
to
have
an
executive
board.

designated
1


in
the
declaration
or

to
act
on
behalf
of
the

2

However,
the
bill
provides
that
an
3


executive
board
shall
not
act
on
behalf
of
the
unit
owners
4


association
to
amend
the
declaration,
to

to

or
6


determine
the
qualifications,
powers
and
duties,
or
terms
of
7


office
of

The
bill
provides,
however,
8


that
an
executive
board
may
fill
vacancies
in
its
membership
9


for
the
unexpired
portion
of
any
term.
10


The
bill
provides
that
a
declaration
(the
instrument
that
11


creates
the
common
interest
community)
may
provide
for
a
period
12


of

of

during
13


which
a
declarant
(the
person
or

who
creates

or
persons
designated
by
the
15


declarant,
may
appoint
and
remove
the
officers
and

of
16


the
executive

The

that
for
declarations
17


filed
on

a
