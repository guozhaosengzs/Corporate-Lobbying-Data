of
the

of
the

of

for
a

rehabilitation
project.
The
project
must
meet
the
statutory

requirements
and
the
criteria
established
in
administrative

rules
by
the
historic
preservation
office.

exceed
an

million
per
fiscal

Approved
8


rehabilitation
projects
must
be
started
and
completed
within

a
certain
time
period.
Upon
completion
of
the
rehabilitation
10


project
a
certificate
of
completion
is
obtained
from
the
state
11


historic

and
a
tax
credit
certificate
is
12


issued.
Tax
credits
are
refundable
and
may
be
transferred
to
13


another
person.
14


Under
the
bill,
an
eligible
taxpayer
may
receive
a
tax
15


credit
not
to
exceed
25
percent
of
the
qualified
rehabilitation
16


expenditures
of
a
qualified
rehabilitation
project.
17


A
“qualified
rehabilitation
project”
is
defined
in
the
bill
18


as
a
project
for
the
rehabilitation
of
property
that
meets
19


three
requirements.
First,
it
must
be
property
listed
on
the
20


national
register
of
historic
places,
historic
property
in
an
21


area
eligible
to
be
designated
a
local
historic
district,
a
22


local
landmark,
or
a
barn
constructed
prior
to
1937.
Second,
23


the
property
must
meet
the
physical
criteria
and
standards
24


for
rehabilitation
established
by
the
department
of
cultural
25


affairs
(department)
by
administrative
rule.
To
the
extent
26


applicable,
such
criteria
and
standards
are
required
to
be
27


consistent
with
United
States
secretary
of
the
interior’s
28


standards
for
rehabilitation.
Third,
the
project
must
have
29


qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures
that,
in
the
case
of
30


commercial
property,
equal
or
exceed
the
lesser
of
at
least
31


$50,000
or
50
percent
of
the
assessed
value
of
the
property,
32


excluding
the
land,
prior
to
rehabilitation;
or
in
the
case
of
33


all
other
property,
must
equal
the
lesser
of
at
least
$25,000
34


or
25
percent
of
the
assessed
value,
excluding
the
land,
prior

to
rehabilitation.
1


“Qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures”
means
the
same
as
2


defined
in
section
47
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
(IRC).
3


However,
the
bill
provides
that
if
the
eligible
taxpayer
is
4


a
nonprofit
corporation,
an
expenditure
will
be
considered
a
5


“qualified
rehabilitation
expenditure”
if
it
is
one
made
for
6


structural
components,
as
defined
in
26
C.F.R.
§1.48-1(e)(2),
7


or
if
it
is
an
architectural
or
engineering
fee,
site
survey
8


fee,
legal
expense,
insurance
premium,
or
development
9


fee.
“Qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures”
may
include
10


expenditures
incurred
prior
to
the
date
the
agreement
is
11


entered
into
by
the
eligible
taxpayer
and
the
department,
but
12


excludes
expenditures
financed
by
federal,
state,
or
local
13


government
grants,
forgivable
loans,
or
other
forms
of
public
14


financial
assistance
that
do
not
require
repayment.
“Eligible
15


taxpayer”
and
“nonprofit
corporation”
are
both
defined
in
the
16


bill.
17


Under
the
bill,
an
eligible
taxpayer
seeking
the
tax
credit
18


must
apply
to
the
department.
The
department
may
prescribe
19


the
timing,
form,
content,
and
method
of
application,
and
may
20


also
establish
criteria
for
the
use
of
electronic
or
other
21


alternative
filing
methods
for
applications,
documents,
or
22


payments.
The
application
must
contain
certain
information
as
23


specified
in
the
bill
and
the
taxpayer
making
the
application
24


has
the
burden
of
proof
to
demonstrate
eligibility
under
the
25


program.
The
department
is
allowed
to
charge
application
or
26


other
fees
based
on
the
costs
of
the
department
associated
with
27


the
program.
28


If
the
project
in
the
application
meets
the
definition
of
a
29


qualified
rehabilitation
project,
the
department
may
register
30


it
under
the
program.
The
bill
requires
the
department
to
31


notify
the
eligible
taxpayer
of
successful
registration
under
32


the
program
and
of
the
amount
of
tax
credits
for
which
the
33


project
has
received
a
tentative
award.
34


The
bill
requires
the
agreement
to
cover
a

of
35

provisions,
including
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit
award,
1


the
rehabilitation
work
to
be
performed,
the
budget
of
2


the
qualified
rehabilitation
project,
and
the
project’s
3


commencement
and
completion
dates.
The
commencement
date
shall
4


not
be
later
than
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
in
which
the
5


agreement
is
entered
into,
and
the
completion
date,
which
is
6


the
date
the
property
is
placed
in
service,
must
be
within
36
7


months
of
the
commencement
date.
The
agreement
shall
provide
8


that
an
eligible
taxpayer
has
no
right
to
receive
a
tax
credit
9


certificate
or
claim
a
tax
credit
until
all
requirements
of
the
10


agreement
and
the
program
have
been
satisfied,
and
that
the
11


amount
of
tax
credit
included
on
a
tax
credit
certificate
shall
12


be
contingent
upon
verification
by
the
department
of
the
amount
13


of
final
qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures.
The
program
14


requires
that
the
eligible
taxpayer
annually
certify
to
the
15


department
the
eligible
taxpayer’s
continuing
compliance
with
16


the
agreement,
and
timely
notify
the
department
of
any
changes
17


that
may
negatively
impact
eligibility
under
the
program.
The
18


eligible
taxpayer
will
have
the
burden
of
proof
to
demonstrate
19


that
all
requirements
of
the
agreement
are
satisfied.
The
20


department
may
find
the
eligible
taxpayer
in
default
if
any
of
21


the
requirements
are
not
met,
and
may
revoke
the
tax
credit
22


award.
Upon
default,
the
department
of
revenue
is
required
23


to
seek
recovery
of
any
tax
credit
claimed.
Finally,
upon
24


completion
of
the
qualified
rehabilitation
project,
the
25


program
requires
the
eligible
taxpayer
to
submit
an
audit
of
26


the
project
from
a
certified
public
accountant
licensed
in
27


this
state.
The
department
is
allowed
to
waive
the
audit
28


requirement
if
the
final
qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures
29


do
not
exceed
$100,000
and
the
project
is
exclusively
funded
by
30


private
funding
sources.
31


After
reviewing
the
audit,
if
applicable,
the
department
32


shall
verify
the
final
qualified
rehabilitation
expenditures
33


and
that
all
requirements
of
the
agreement
were
satisfied.
34


Following
that,
the
department
may
issue
within
60
days
a

stating
the
amount
of
tax
credit
that
may
be

claimed,
but
such
amount
shall
not
exceed
the
amount
of
the
tax

credit
award
provided
for
in
the
agreement.
3


The
bill
prohibits
the
department
from
awarding
more
4


than
$45
million
in
tax
credits
per
fiscal
year,
with
four
5


exceptions.
First,
any
tax
credit
that
is
awarded
during
a
6


fiscal
year
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2016,
and
that
is
7


irrevocably
declined
or
revoked
on
or
before
June
30
of
the
8


next
fiscal
year,
may
be
awarded
during
the
fiscal
year
in
9


which
the
declination
or
revocation
occurs
without
regard
to
10


the
$45
million
cap.
Second,
any
tax
credit
that
was
reserved
11


under
current
law
before
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
for
use
12


in
a
fiscal
year
beginning
before
July
1,
2016,
and
that
is
13


irrevocably
declined
or
revoked
on
or
after
the
effective
date
14


of
the
bill,
but
before
July
1,
2016,
may
be
awarded
during
15


the
fiscal
year
in
which
the
declination
or
revocation
occurs,
16


without
regard
to
the
$45
million
cap.
However,
such
credits
17


shall
not
be
claimed
before
the
fiscal
year
for
which
they
were
18


originally
reserved.
Third,
any
amount
of
tax
credit
that
19


was
available
for
approval
under
current
law
during
fiscal
20


years
2010-2011,
2011-2012,
2012-2013,
or
2013-2014,
that
was
21


required
to
be
allocated
to
new
projects
with
final
qualified
22


rehabilitation
costs
of
$500,000
or
less,
or
$750,000
or
less,
23


as
the
case
may
be,
and
that
was
not
finally
approved,
may
be
24


awarded
during
fiscal
years
2014-2015
and
2015-2016
without
25


regard
to
the
$45
million
cap.
Fourth,
if
the
department
26


awards
during
fiscal
year
2016-2017,
or
any
fiscal
year
27


thereafter,
an
amount
of
tax
credits
that
is
less
than
the
$45
28


million
cap,
the
department
may
carry
forward
the
difference
29


between
the
amount
so
awarded
and
the
$45
million
cap,
not
to
30


exceed
10
percent
of
the
cap,
to
the
succeeding
fiscal
year
31


for
award
during
that
fiscal
year,
without
regard
to
the
$45
32


million
cap.
33


The
bill
makes
several
technical
changes
to
Code
section
34


404A.5,
which
governs
the
department’s
reporting
and

to

3


The
bill
requires
the
department
and
the
department
of
4


revenue
to
adopt
rules
to
jointly
administer
the
program.
5


Unless
otherwise

the
bill,
the
bill
applies

to
agreements
entered
into
by
the
department
and
an
eligible
