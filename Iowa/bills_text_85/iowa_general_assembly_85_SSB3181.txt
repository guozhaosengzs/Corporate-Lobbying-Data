this

does
not
constitute

22


This
bill
relates
to

care
tax
23


credit
available
against
the
individual
income
tax.
The
Iowa
24


child
and
dependent
care
tax
credit
is
a
refundable
credit
25


calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
nonrefundable
federal
child
26


and
dependent
care
tax
credit,
depending
on
the
Iowa
net
income
27


of
the
taxpayer.
28


Iowa

Code
701-42.15(1),
which
governs

whose
federal
30


credit
is
limited
to
their
federal
tax
liability,
the
Iowa
31


credit
shall
be
computed
based
on
the
lesser
amount.
In
other
32


words,
the
amount
of
the
Iowa
credit
is
limited
to
a
percentage
33


of
the
federal
credit
actually
claimed
against
federal
tax
34


liability,
not
a
percentage
of
the
total
federal
credit

_____


taxpayer
was
eligible
to
claim
against
federal
tax
liability.
1


The
bill
amends
Code
section
422.12C
to
provide
that
the
2


Iowa
credit
will
be
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
federal
3


credit,
whether
or
not
the
federal
credit
was
limited
by
the
4


taxpayer’s
federal
tax
liability.
5


The
bill
also
increases
the
net
income
amounts
and
credit
6


percentages
in
each
of
the
seven
graduated
brackets
used
to
7


calculate
the
credit.
The
credit
percentages
in
these
seven
8


brackets
currently
range
from
a
high
of
75
percent
of
the
9


federal
credit
for
taxpayers
with
net
income
of
less
than
10


$10,000,
to
a
low
of
30
percent
of
the
federal
credit
for
11


taxpayers
with
net
income
of
$40,000
or
more
but
less
than
12


$45,000.
The
credit
is
currently
unavailable
to
taxpayers
13


whose
net
income
is
$45,000
or
more.
The
bill
increases
these
14


to
a
high
of
93.75
percent
of
the
federal
credit
for
taxpayers
15


with
net
income
of
less
than
$14,980,
and
to
a
low
of
37.50
16


percent
of
the
federal
credit
for
taxpayers
with
net
income
17


of
$59,920
or
more
but
less
than
$67,410.
The
credit
will
be
18


unavailable
to
taxpayers
whose
net
income
is
$67,410
or
more.
19


The
bill
also
adjusts
the
future
amount
of
each
of
the
20


net
income
amounts
in
the
seven
graduated
credit
brackets
by
21


indexing
the
dollar
amounts
to
inflation.
22


The
bill
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
2014,
for
tax
23


years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date.
