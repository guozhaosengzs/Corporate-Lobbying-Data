EXPLANATION
15


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
16


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general

17


This
bill
relates
to
the
Iowa
child
and
dependent
care
tax
18


credit
available
against
the
individual
income
tax.
The
Iowa
19


child
and
dependent
care
tax
credit
is
a
refundable
credit
20


calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
nonrefundable
federal
child
21


and
dependent
care
tax
credit,
depending
on
the
Iowa
net
income
22


of
the
taxpayer.
23


Iowa
Administrative
Code
701-42.15(1),
which
governs
the
24


computation
of
the
Iowa
credit,
was
amended
in
2012
to
specify
25


that
for
taxpayers
whose
federal
credit
is
limited
to
their
26


federal
tax
liability,
the
Iowa
credit
shall
be
computed
27


based
on
the
lesser
amount.
In
other
words,
the
amount
of
28


the
Iowa
credit
is
limited
to
a
percentage
of
the
federal
29


credit
actually
claimed
against
federal
tax
liability,
not
30


a
percentage
of
the
total
federal
credit
the
taxpayer
was
31


eligible
to
claim
against
federal
tax
liability.
32


The
bill
amends
Code
section
422.12C
to
provide
that
the
33


Iowa
credit
will
be
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
federal
34


credit,
whether
or
not
the
federal
credit
was
limited
by
the
