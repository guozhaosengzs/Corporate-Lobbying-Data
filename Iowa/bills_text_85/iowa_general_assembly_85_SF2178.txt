the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of

11


GENERAL.
This
bill
prohibits
the
slaughter
of
equines,
12


including
by
amending
Iowa’s
“Meat
and
Poultry
Inspection
Act”
13


(Code
chapter
189A)
and
creating
a
new
chapter
(Code
chapter
14


189B).
The
bill
defines
the
term
“equine”
to
mean
a
member

obtaining
a
food
product
and
31


that
