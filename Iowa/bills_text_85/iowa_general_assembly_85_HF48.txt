EXPLANATION
11


In
2012,
a
property
tax
exemption
was
enacted
for
the
value
12


added
by
any
new
or
refitted
construction
or
installation
of
13


a
geothermal
heating
or
cooling
system
on
or
after
July
1,
14


2012,
on
property
classified
as
residential.
The
exemption
15


is
allowed
for
10
consecutive
years
following
application
and
16


approval.
This
bill
removes
the
10-year
limitation
on
the
17


exemption.
18


Current
Code
section
441.21(8)
provides
that
any
19


construction
or
installation
of
a
solar
energy
system
on
20


property
classified
as
agricultural,
residential,
commercial,
21


or
industrial
property
shall
not
increase
the
actual,
assessed,
22


and
taxable
values
of
the
property
for
five
full
assessment
23


years.
The
bill
removes
the
five-year
limitation
and
specifies
24


that
such
added
value
of
solar
energy
systems
constructed
or
25


installed
after
January
1,
2008,
is
exempt
from
taxation.
26


Code
section
441.21(8)
defines
“solar
energy
system”
to
27


mean
either:
(1)
a
system
of
equipment
capable
of
collecting
28


and
converting
incident
solar
radiation
or
wind
energy
into
29


thermal,
mechanical,
or
electrical
energy
and
transforming
30


these
forms
of
energy
by
a
separate
apparatus
to
storage
or
to
31


a
point
of
use
or
(2)
a
system
that
uses
the
basic
design
of
32


the
building
to
maximize
solar
heat
gain
during
the
cold
season
33


and
to
minimize
solar
heat
gain
in
the
hot
season
and
that
uses
34


natural
means
to
collect,
store,
and
distribute
solar
energy.
