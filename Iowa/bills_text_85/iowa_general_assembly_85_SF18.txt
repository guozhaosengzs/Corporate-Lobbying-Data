EXPLANATION
14


This
bill
authorizes
a
contingent
appropriation
from
the
15


Iowa
economic
emergency
fund
and
the
cash
reserve
fund
to
16


prevent
a
deficit
in
the
general
fund
of
the
state.
17


The
bill
amends
the
Iowa
economic
emergency
fund
18


provisions
in
Code
section
8.55
to
authorize
a
new
contingent
19


appropriation
of
up
to
10
percent
of
the
available
combined
20


balances
of
the
Iowa
economic
emergency
fund
and
the
cash
21


reserve
fund
or
$100
million,
whichever
is
less,
to
the
general
22


fund
of
the
state.
An
existing
contingent
appropriation
for
a
23


similar
purpose
in
Code
section
8.55,
subsection
3,
paragraph
24


“c”,
may
only
be
made
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year.
The
new
25


appropriation
is
contingent
upon
the
following:
the
governor
26


projecting
that
the
appropriation
is
necessary
to
preclude
27


the
governor
from
ordering
an
across-the-board
appropriation
28


reduction
in
accordance
with
Code
section
8.31,
the
governor
29


projecting
that
without
the
appropriation
the
balance
of
the
30


general
fund
will
be
negative
at
the
close
of
the
fiscal
31


year,
the
general
assembly
is
not
in
regular
or
extraordinary
32


session,
and
the
governor
verifies
these
contingencies
in
33


an
official
proclamation
which
states
the
reasons
why
the
34


appropriation
is
necessary
to
prevent
an
overdraft
on
