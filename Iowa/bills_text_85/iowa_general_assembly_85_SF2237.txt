drawn
will
produce
12


evidence

the
method
used
to
take
the
blood
13


sample
is
reasonable
and
performed
by
medical
personnel,
and
14


the
peace
officer
reasonably
believes
that
the
delay
necessary
15


to
obtain
a
warrant
threatens
the
destruction
of
the
evidence.
16


The
bill
allows
in
some
circumstances
where
