H.F.

apply
to
the
department
of
human
services
for
assistance
to
1


continue
current
core
MH/DS
to
target
populations
that
are
2


not
funded
by
the
medical
assistance
(Medicaid)
program.
3


Part
of
the
redesign
legislation
provided
for
the
state
to
4


assume
responsibility
effective
July
1,
2012,
for
paying
the
5


nonfederal
share
of
Medicaid
program
costs
for
adult
MH/DS
6


in
place
of
the
counties.
Counties
remain
obligated
for
the
7


nonfederal
share
of
the
Medicaid
costs
incurred
prior
to
that
8


date.
9


In
accordance
with
SF
2315,
the
department
received
10


applications
for
transition
fund
assistance
from
counties
and,
11


based
on
various
criteria
in
the
legislation
and
developed
12


by
the
department,
made
recommendations
for
specific
funding
13


amounts
to
be
awarded
to
counties
under
three
different
14


scenarios.
Under
all
three
scenarios,
the
department
15


recommended
that
six
counties
should
not
receive
any
funding.
16


Of
the
six
counties,
five
counties
have
outstanding
Medicaid
17


billing
obligations.
18


The
bill
makes
a
$750,000
appropriation
to
the
department
19


to
supplement
the
FY
2012-2013
appropriation
for
Medicaid.
20


If
a
county
applied
for
assistance
from
the
transition
fund
21


but
the
county
was
not
recommended
by
the
department
for
any
22


award
amount,
the
county
is
eligible
to
receive
a
credit.
The
23


credit
is
required
to
be
applied
to
the
county’s
obligation
for
24


outstanding
Medicaid
billings.
The
amount
of
the
credit
is
25


equal
to
the
amount
of
the
county’s
obligation,
or
$150,000,
26


whichever
is
less.
27


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
