This

concerns

under
the
purview
of
the
banking
8


division
of
the
department
of
commerce.
9


The
bill
modifies
provisions
in
Code
section
524.107
10


relating
to
when
a
person
doing
business
in
Iowa
may
be
11


permitted
to
use
the
words
“bank”
or
“trust”,
or
any
12


derivative,
plural,
or
compound
of
“bank”
or
“trust”,
in
13


a
manner
which
creates
the
impression
that
the
person
is
14


authorized
to
engage
in
the
business
of
banking
or
act
in
a
15


fiduciary
capacity.
Currently,
the
specified
list
of
persons
16


so
authorized
includes,
among
others,
a
bank
authorized
17


pursuant
to
Code
chapter
524.
The
bill
adds
the
provision
18


that
a
bank
authorized
by
the
laws
of
another
state
to
utilize
19


“bank”
or
“trust”
in
a
manner
tending
to
create
the
impression
20


that
the
person
is
authorized
to
engage
in
the
business
of
21


banking
or
act
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
shall
also
be
authorized
22


to
do
so
in
this
state.
The
bill
also
makes
a
conforming
change
23


to
promote
consistency
between
section
524.107,
subsections
1
24


and
2.
25


The
bill
also
makes
a
technical
correction
to
Code
section
26


544A.13,
subsection
1,
changing
a
reference
to
“provisions
of
27


this
Act”
to
“provisions
of
this
chapter”.
28


Additionally,
the
bill
repeals
Code
section
544A.21.
That
29


section
permits
specified
business
entities
to
engage
in
the
30


practice
of
architecture
in
Iowa
if
certain
requirements
are
31


met.
32


Further,
the
bill
repeals
Code
provisions
that
permit
the
33


use
of
discounts
for
minority
status
and
lack
of
marketability
34


in
determining
the
fair
value
of
shares
of
banks
and
