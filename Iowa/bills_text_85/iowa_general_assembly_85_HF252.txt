EXPLANATION
11


BACKGROUND
——
AGRICULTURAL
ASSETS
TRANSFER
TAX
CREDIT.
12


In
2006,
the
general
assembly
enacted
SF
2268
(2006
Iowa
13


Acts,
chapter
1161)
that
provides
a
tax
credit
for
owners
14


of
agricultural
assets
(agricultural
land,
depreciable
15


agricultural
property,
crops,
or
livestock)
who
help
beginning
16


farmers
acquire
those
agricultural
assets
by
lease
or
rental
17


arrangements.
The
program
is
administered
by
the
agricultural
18


development
authority
(authority)
established
within
the
19


department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship.
A
beginning
20


farmer
is
an
individual,
partnership,
family
farm
corporation,
21


or
family
farm
limited
liability
company
as
provided
under
22


Code
chapter
9H
(Iowa’s
corporate
farming
law),
with
a
low
or
23


moderate
net
worth,
and
who
engages
in
farming
or
wishes
to
24


engage
in
farming.
The
owner
who
executes
an
agricultural
25


assets
transfer
agreement
approved
by
the
authority
may
26


claim
a
tax
credit
against
individual
or
corporate
income
27


tax
liability
after
receiving
a
certificate
issued
by
the
28


authority.
Generally,
the
lessor
must
be
a
person
who
may
29


acquire
or
otherwise
obtain
or
lease
agricultural
land
under
30


Code
chapter
9H
or
9I
(restricting
corporate
and
foreign
31


ownership
of
agricultural
land).
The
bill
provides
a
number
32


of
restrictions
upon
the
authority
in
approving
applications
33


and
issuing
certificates.
The
owner
cannot
be
at
fault
for
34


terminating
a
prior
agreement,
be
involved
in
legal
proceedings

regarding
environmental
violations,
or
agree
to
provide
more
1


agricultural
assets
than
the
beginning
farmer
can
be
expected
2


to
adequately
manage.
The
agricultural
assets
cannot
be
leased
3


or
rented
at
a
rate
substantially
different
from
similar
market
4


arrangements.
The
agreement
may
be
terminated,
but
if
the
5


termination
is
the
fault
of
the
owner,
any
tax
credits
must
be
6


repaid
and
no
further
tax
credit
certificates
can
be
issued
to
7


the
taxpayer.
8


The
tax
credit
equals
5
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
9


taxpayer
under
the
agreement,
except
in
the
case
of
a
landlord
10


who
shares
in
the
costs
associated
with
production.
In
that
11


case,
the
tax
credit
equals
15
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
12


the
taxpayer
from
crops
or
animals
sold.
13


In
2009,
the
general
assembly
enacted
SF
483
(2009
Iowa
Acts,
14


chapter
135),
which
capped
the
amount
of
tax
credits
to
be
an
15


amount
not
to
exceed
$6
million
per
year
with
the
requirement
16


that
the
certificates
must
be
issued
on
a
first-come,
17


first-served
basis.
18


BILL
——
BEGINNING
FARMER
TAX
CREDIT
PROGRAM.
This
bill
19


amends
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
creates
20


a
new
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit
to
encourage
taxpayers
21


who
hold
agricultural
land,
in
the
same
manner
as
required
22


under
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit,
to
enter
23


into
custom
farming
contracts
with
beginning
farmers.
The
bill
24


provides
common
criteria
for
beginning
farmers
who
qualify
as
25


beginning
farmers
to
participate
in
the
program.
A
qualified
26


beginning
farmer
must
be
a
resident
of
this
state;
have
27


sufficient
education,
training,
or
experience
in
farming;
have
28


access
to
adequate
working
capital
and
production
equipment,
29


will
materially
and
substantially
participate
in
farming,
and
30


is
not
responsible
for
managing
or
maintaining
agricultural
31


land
and
other
agricultural
assets
that
are
greater
than
32


necessary
to
adequately
support
a
beginning
farmer.
The
33


bill
requires
the
authority
to
administer
the
tax
credits
34


in
a
uniform
manner,
and
establish
a
due

The
bill
makes

net
worth
requirements
for
beginning
farmers
uniform
among
2


all
programs
administered
by
the
authority
($691,172).
The

authority
must
submit
an

to

and

regarding

BILL
——
AGRICULTURAL
ASSETS
TRANSFER
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
6


amends
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit.
The
7


bill
provides
that
an
agricultural
transfer
agreement
cannot
8


be
assigned
and
the
land
subject
to
the
agreement
cannot
be
9


subleased.
The
bill
increases
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit.

includes
a
lease
on
a
cash
basis,
the
11


credit
is
increased
from
5
to
7
percent
of
the
gross
amount
12


paid
to
the
taxpayer
under
the
agreement.
For
an
agreement
13


which
includes
a
lease
on
a
commodity
share
basis,
the
rate
14


is
increased
from
15
to
17
percent.
However,
the
percentages
15


are
increased
by
one
percentage
point
if
the
beginning
farmer
16


is
a
veteran.
The
bill
also
allows
the
authority
to
elect
an
17


alternative
method
to
compute
a
tax
credit
for
a
lease
based
on
18


a
crop
share
basis
according
to
a
formula
which
multiplies
the
19


average
per
bushel
yield
in
the
same
county
where
the
leased
20


land
is
located
by
a
per
bushel
state
price.
The
bill
provides
21


that
an
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
cannot
exceed
22


$50,000.
23


BILL
——
CUSTOM
FARMING
CONTRACT
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
24


establishes
a
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit
to
encourage
25


taxpayers
who
hold
agricultural
land
to
execute
custom
farming
26


contracts
with
beginning
farmers
who
qualify
under
the
terms
of
27


the
bill.
The
bill
provides
that
the
custom
farming
contract
28


tax
credit
is
also
to
be
administered
by
the
authority.
29


The
bill
provides
that
the
contract
amount
of
a
custom
30


farming
contract
cannot
be
substantially
higher
or
lower
than
31


the
market
rate
for
similar
contracts.
The
contract
must
be
32


in
writing
and
cannot
be
for
more
than
12
months’
duration.
33


The
taxpayer
must
make
all
management
decisions
substantially
34


contributing
to
or
affecting
the
production
of
crops
or
35

livestock
located
on
the
taxpayer’s
agricultural
land,
although
1


the
qualified
beginning
farmer
may
make
day-to-day
operational
2


decisions
affecting
production.
The
qualified
beginning
farmer
3


must
provide
any
necessary
tools,
machinery,
or
equipment
4


and
labor
must
be
furnished
on
a
regular,
continuous,
and
5


substantial
basis.
In
addition,
the
taxpayer
and
the
beginning
6


farmer
cannot
have
a
common
legal
or
equitable
interest
in
7


the
agricultural
land
or
be
related
to
each
other
as
family
8


members.
9


A
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit
is
allowed
only
for
the
10


amount
paid
by
the
taxpayer
to
a
qualified
beginning
farmer
11


under
a
custom
farming
contract
on
a
cash
basis
equaling
at
12


least
$1,000.
The
tax
credit
equals
7
percent
of
the
gross
13


amount
paid
to
the
beginning
farmer
under
the
custom
farming
14


contract.
The
tax
credit
is
increased
to
8
percent
for
one
15


year
if
the
beginning
farmer
is
a
veteran.
It
allows
the
16


tax
credit
to
be
carried
forward
but
not
back,
and
is
not
17


transferrable.
The
department
of
revenue
may
recapture
the
18


amount
of
the
tax
credit
if
the
contract
is
terminated
due
19


to
the
taxpayer’s
fault,
as
specified
in
the
bill.
The
bill
20


requires
the
authority
to
issue
a
tax
certificate
to
the
21


taxpayer
which
must
be
attached
to
the
tax
return.
A
tax
22


credit
certificate
cannot
exceed
$50,000.
23


TAX
CREDIT
CERTIFICATES.
The
bill
allows
the
authority
to
24


issue
each
year
up
to
$12
million
in
tax
credit
certificates
25


for
both
the
current
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
26


and
the
bill’s
new
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit.
Each
27


year,
$8
million
is
allocated
to
support
the
agricultural
28


assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
$4
million
is
allocated
to
29


support
the
custom
framing
contract
tax
credit.
However,
the
30


authority
may
adjust
the
allocation
during
the
year
as
it
deems
31


necessary.
The
authority
must
issue
tax
credit
certificates
32


allocated
under
the
new
program
on
a
first-come,
first-served
33


basis,
as
is
the
case
for
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
34


credit.
