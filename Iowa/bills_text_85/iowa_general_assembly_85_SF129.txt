NEW
SUBSECTION


.
99.
The
sales
price
of
a
physical
exercise
3


club
contract.
For
purposes
of
this
subsection,
“physical
4


exercise
club
contract”
means
the
same
as
defined
in
section

552.1,
and
“sales
price”
includes
“contract
price”
as
defined
6


in
section
552.1.

EXPLANATION
8


This
bill
creates
a
sales
tax
exemption
for
physical
9


exercise
club
contracts.
The
term
“physical
exercise
club
10


contract”
is
defined
in
Code
section
552.1
and
means
an
11


agreement
by
which
a
buyer
is
entitled
to
membership
in
a
12


physical
exercise
club
or
use
of
the
services
or
facilities
13


of
a
physical
exercise
club.
The
exemption
applies
to
the
14


“sales
price”
of
such
contracts,
which
is
defined
in
Code
15


section
423.1.
However,
because
Code
section
552.1
uses
the
16


term
“contract
price”
in
relation
to
physical
exercise
club
17


contracts,
the
term
“sales
price”
is
defined
for
purposes
of
18


the
exemption
to
include
“contract
price”.
19


By
operation
of
Code
section
423.6,
an
item
exempt
from
the
20


imposition
of
the
sales
tax
is
also
exempt
from
the
use
tax
21


imposed
in
Code
section
423.5.
