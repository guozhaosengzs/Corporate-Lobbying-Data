or
infectious
disease
and
23

disease
with

The

a

7


while
infected
with
a
contagious
or
infectious
disease,
or
8


declining
treatment
for
a
contagious
or
infectious
disease
9


during
pregnancy
does
not
constitute
a
crime
under
the
bill.
10


The
bill
also
specifies
that
evidence
that
a
person
knows
the
11


person
is
infected
with
a
contagious
or
infectious
disease
and
12


has
engaged

conduct
that
exposes
others
to
the
contagious
or
13


infectious
disease,
regardless
of
the
frequency
of
the
conduct,
14


is
insufficient
on
its
own
to
prove
the
intent
to
transmit
15


the
contagious
or
infectious
disease.
Additionally,
the
bill
16


specifies
that
a
person
does
not
act
with
the
intent
or
the
17


reckless
disregard
required
to
commit
the
crimes
specified
18


under
the
bill
if
the
person
takes
practical
means
to
prevent
19


transmission,
or
if
the
person
informs
the
uninfected
person
of
20


the
person’s
contagious
or
infectious
disease
status
and
offers
21


to
take
practical
means
to
prevent
transmission
but
that
offer
22


is
rejected
by
the
uninfected
person
subsequently
exposed
to
23


the
infectious
or
contagious
disease.
Under
the
bill,
it
is
an
24


affirmative
defense
to
a
charge
under
the
bill
if
the
person
25


exposed
to
the
contagious
or
infectious
disease
knew
that
the
26


infected
person
was
infected
with
the
contagious
or
infectious
27


disease
at
the
time
of
the
exposure
and
consented
to
exposure
28


with
that
knowledge.
29


The
bill
also
repeals
the
provision
establishing
the
knowing
30


transmission
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
as
31


a
crime
under
Code
section
709C.1.
Under
current
Code,
a
32


person
commits
criminal
transmission
of
HIV
if
the
person,
33


knowing
that
the
person’s
human

status
34


is
positive,
engages
