Nonbusiness
interest,

less

shall
be
allocated
within

state
in
the
following
manner:
14


(1)
Nonbusiness
interest,
dividends,
and
royalties
from
15


patents
and
copyrights
shall
be
allocable
to
this
state
if

(2)
Nonbusiness

received

(3)
Nonbusiness
rents
and

to
the
extent
21


that
the
property
is
utilized
in
this
state;
or
in
their
22


entirety
if
the

commercial
domicile
is
in
this
state

and
the

The
extent
of
utilization
of
tangible
25


personal
property
in
a
state
is
determined
by
multiplying
the
26


rents
and

property
in
the

state
during
the
rental
or
royalty
period
in
the
taxable
year

and
the
denominator
of
which
is
the
number
of
days
of
physical
30


location
of
the
property
everywhere
during
all
rental
or
31


royalty
periods
in
the
taxable
year.
If
the
physical
location
32


of
the
property
during
the
rental
or
royalty
period
is
unknown
33


or
unascertainable
by
the

tangible
personal

is
