authorizes
the
board
of

supervisors
of
a
county
with
less
than
20,000
residents

based
upon
the
2000
certified
federal
census
to
establish

a
rural
improvement
zone
in
an
area
surrounding
a
private
10


lake
development
located
in
an
unincorporated
area
of
the
11


county
if
the
board
determines
that
the
area
is
in
need
of
12


improvements.
A
rural
improvement
zone
is
governed
by
a
board
13


of
trustees
and
is
authorized
to
enter
into
contracts
and
incur
14


indebtedness
to
provide
funds
for
the
costs
of
improvements,
15


levy
a
standby
property
tax
upon
taxable
property
within
the
16


zone,
and
divide
property
tax
revenue
from
the
zone
in
the
17


same
manner
as
an
urban
renewal
area
under
Code
chapter
403.
18


Current
Code
section
357H.10
provides
that
a
rural
improvement
19


zone
is
dissolved
upon
the
adoption
of
a
resolution
of
the
20


board
of
trustees
which
specifies
that
all
improvements
have
21


been
made
in
the
zone
and
all
indebtedness
has
been
paid.
22


In
addition,
current
law
provides
that
upon
dissolution
all
23


assets
of
the
rural
improvement
zone
shall
be
deeded
to
a
24


nonprofit
corporation
whose
members
are
property
owners
of
the
25


improvement
zone.
26


This
bill
provides
that
each
rural
improvement
zone
is
27


dissolved
on
the
date
seven
years
after
the
date
that
the
28


resolution
of
the
board
of
supervisors
establishing
the
zone
29


was
adopted
or
June
30,
2014,
whichever
is
later.
The
bill
30


provides
that
if
a
rural
improvement
zone
is
dissolved
by
31


operation
of
the
bill
and
indebtedness
of
the
zone
remains
32


unpaid
on
the
date
of
dissolution,
such
indebtedness
shall
33


be
assumed
by
and
become
an
indebtedness
of
the
nonprofit
34


corporation
to
which
the
zone’s
assets
are
deeded.
