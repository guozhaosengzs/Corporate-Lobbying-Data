Academy,
the
medical
protocols
established
by
the
MFPRSI
board
2


shall
control.
3


Code
section
411.1
is
amended
to
define
a
vested
member
of
4


MFPRSI
as
a
member
who
is
eligible
to
receive
a
retirement
5


benefit
by
completing
at
least
four
years
of
service
or
6


attaining
age
55
while
performing
membership
service.
7


Code
section
411.5,
concerning
the
administration
of
MFPRSI,
8


is
amended
to
provide
that
benefits
paid
under
MFPRSI
shall
9


comply
with
the
required
beginning
date
and
required
minimum
10


distribution
provisions
of
the
federal
Internal
Revenue
Code.
11


Code
section
411.6(1),
concerning
calculation
of
a
service
12


retirement
benefit,
is
amended
to
provide
that
a
vested
member
13


of
MFPRSI
with
less
than
22
years
of
membership
service
is
14


entitled
to
receive
a
service
retirement
allowance
based
on
the
15


number
of
years
of
service
credited
to
the
member.
Current
16


law
provides
this
service
retirement
allowance
only
to
those
17


members
with
at
least
four
years
of
service.
18


Code
section
411.6(8),
concerning
an
ordinary
death
benefit
19


under
MFPRSI,
is
amended
by
striking
the
provision
granting
20


to
the
deceased
member’s
dependent
parents,
if
there
is
no
21


surviving
spouse
or
child,
an
option
to
elect
as
the
death
22


benefit
a
monthly
pension
benefit
in
lieu
of
a
lump
sum
23


payment.
The
change
does
not
eliminate
the
ability
of
a
24


deceased
member’s
parents
to
receive
a
lump
sum
ordinary
death
25


benefit
if
otherwise
eligible.
26


Code
section
411.9,
concerning
military
service,
is
amended
27


by
adding
two
new
subsections.
28


New
Code
section
411.9(2A)
provides
that
if
a
member’s
29


disability
was
incurred
while
performing
qualified

30


service,
the
member
shall
be
permitted
to
file
an
application
31


for
an
ordinary
disability
retirement
regardless
of
whether
the
32


member
returned
to
membership
service
following
the
disability.
33


New
Code
section
411.9(2B)
provides
that

the
member
shall
2


be
treated
as

service
and
the
3


period
of
military
service
shall
be
treated
as
membership
4


service
for
purposes
of
Code
chapter
411.
Code
section
5


411.9(2)
is
also
amended
to
reflect
that
the
period
of
military
6


service
shall
be
counted
as
membership
service
for
purposes
of
7


providing
death
benefits
to
a
member
who
dies
while
performing

qualified
military
service.
The
bill
provides
that
both

and
apply
retroactively
to
10


January
1,

the
member’s
14

shall
be
