H.F.

The
bill
strikes
Code
section
724.4
relating
to
the
crime
of
1


carrying
dangerous
weapons,
an
aggravated
misdemeanor,
without
2


a
valid
permit
or
in
other
enumerated
circumstances.
Instead,
3


the
bill
section
creates
a
new
crime
of
going
armed
with
a
4


knife
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
5


The
bill
makes
a
conforming
change
to
Code
section
232.52,
6


subsection
2,
relating
to
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
a
7


juvenile’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privilege.
The
bill
8

makes
a
conforming
Code
change
to
Code
section
724.4B,
9


relating
to
the
carrying
of
weapons
on
school
grounds,
to
10


specifically
include
certain
categories
of
persons
who
are
11


authorized
to
carry
weapons
on
school
grounds.
12


The
bill
amends
Code
section
724.4C
relating
to
the
crime
of
13


possession
or
carrying
of
firearms
while
under
the
influence
14


of
alcohol
or
a
drug.
Current
law
invalidates
a
permit
to
15


carry
weapons
if
the
person
to
whom
the
permit
is
issued
is
16


intoxicated,
as
defined
in
Code
section
321J.2,
subsection
1
17


(while
under
the
influence
of
an
alcoholic
beverage
or
other
18


drug
or
a
combination
of
such
substances,
while
having
an
19


alcohol
concentration
of
.08

more,

while
any

of
a
20


controlled
substance
is
present
in
the
person,
as
measured
in
21


the
person’s
blood
or
urine).
The
bill
amends
this
provision
22


to
provide
that
a
person
commits
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
23


the
person
is
intoxicated
and
the
person
either
carries
a
24


dangerous
weapon
on
or
about
the
person
or
carries
a
dangerous
25


weapon
within
the
person’s
immediate
access
or
reach
while
in
26


a
vehicle.
This
crime
does
not
apply
to
situations
where
a
27


person
carries
or
possesses
a
dangerous
weapon
while
in
the
28


person’s
own
dwelling,
place
of
business,
or
on
the
person’s
29


land,
and
the
transitory
possession
or
use
of
a
firearm
during
30


an
act
of
justified
self-defense
or
justified
defense
of
31


another,
if
the
possession
of
the
firearm
lasts
no
longer
than
32


immediately
necessary
to
resolve
the
emergency.
33


The
bill
strikes

duty
to
