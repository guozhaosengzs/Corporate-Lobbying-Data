EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
includes
as
a
mandatory
eligible
group
under
16


the
Medicaid
program,
foster
children
who
were
under
the
17


responsibility
of
the
state,
as
required
pursuant
to
the
18


federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
of
19


2010.
The
ACA
requires
that
foster
children
are
eligible
for
20


Medicaid
coverage
until
they
reach
age
26
if
they
were
in
21


foster
care
when
they
turned
18
or
a
higher
age
as
provided
for
22


coverage
of
foster
care
children
under
the
Medicaid
state
plan
23


(up
to
21
years
of
age
in
Iowa),
and
were
enrolled
in
Medicaid
24


at
that
time.
This
provision
mirrors
another
provision
in
25


the
ACA
which
provides
the
opportunity
for
health
insurance
26


coverage
for
children
up
to
age
26
under
a
parent’s
insurance
27


policy.
The
requirements
under
the
ACA
are
effective
January
28


1,
2014.
The
bill
provides
for
implementation
July
1,
2013.
29


The
bill
also
directs
the
department
of
human
services
to
30


submit
a
Medicaid
state
plan
amendment
to
implement
the
bill
31


effective
July
1,
2013.
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
