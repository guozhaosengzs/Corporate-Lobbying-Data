BILL
——
UNIFORM
CLASSIFICATIONS
AND
ASSESSMENTS.
The
bill
10


provides
that
the
governing
board
of
a
drainage
district
may
11


order
the
reclassification
and
recalculation
of
assessments
12


in
the
drainage
district
in
the
manner
similar
to
an
option
13


available
for
levee
district
(Code
section
468.184),
so
that
14


the
per
acre
assessment
is
equal
to
the
total
amount
to
be
15


assessed
divided
by
the
total
acres
within
the
district.
This
16


alternative
method
must
be
adopted
by
board
action
after
17


providing
notice
and
hearing
to
landowners.
18


BACKGROUND
——
GENERAL.
Drainage
systems
are
created
to
19


remove
excess
water
from
the
soil
profile
of,
especially,
20


cropland
while
levees
are
constructed
as
barriers,
usually
21


constructed
along
the
top
bank
of
a
stream
to
protect
adjacent
22


land
from
surface
water
overflow
during
high
water
periods.
23


Iowa
law
provides
procedures
to
organize
and
manage
a
levee
24


and
drainage
district
(Code
chapter
468;
see
also
Article
25


III,
section
18
of
the
Iowa
Constitution),
including
its
26


establishment
by
petition
of
landowners
(Code
section
468.8).
27


An
established
district
is
managed
by
a
board
which
is
the
28


county
board
of
supervisors
for
a
district
established
in
29


one
county,
the
joint
boards
of
supervisors
in
a
district
30


which
crosses
county
lines
(intercounty
districts),
or
by
31


the
district’s
landowners
acting
through
an
elected
board
of
32


trustees
(Code
section
468.3(2)).
33


BACKGROUND
——
CLASSIFICATION
AND
ASSESSMENTS.
When
a
34


district
is
established,
the
board
classifies
land
located
35


-2-


LSB
5900HH
(2)
85


da/sc

H.F.

within
the
district
for
purposes
of
determining
each
land
1


owner’s
assessed
amount
for
improving
the
land
and
making
2


necessary
repairs
(Code
section
468.38).
The
assessed
amount
3


is
based
on
the
availability
of
the
improved
land
rather
than
4


its
actual
utilization.
Generally,
assessments
are
calculated
5


when
the
district
is
established
(and
constructed)
based
6


on
a
proportional
or
graduated
scale
equitably
apportioned
7


according
to
the
benefit
received
by
land
classification.
A
8


board
may
voluntarily
order
a
reclassification
and
accompanying
9


recalculation
of
the
assessments
assigned
to
each
landowner
if
10


it
determines
that
the
assessments
are
generally
inequitable
11


(Code
section
468.65).
A
special
process
applies
to
levee
12


districts.
By
board
action
or
election,
the
land
within
the
13


district
may
be
classified
and
assessed
uniformly
so
that
14


each
acre
of
land
is
assessed
at
the
same
rate
(Code
section
15


468.184).
