EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
relates
to
voting
by
persons
in
certain
health
10


care
facilities
and
hospitals.
Current
law
provides
different
11


requirements
for
absentee
voting
by
a
person
who
is
a
resident
12


or
patient
of
a
health
care
facility
or
hospital
in
the
county
13


in
which
the
person
is
registered
to
vote
and
for
absentee
14


voting
by
a
person
who
is
a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
15


care
facility
or
hospital
in
a
county
other
than
the
county
in
16


which
the
person
is
registered
to
vote.
Current
law
requires
17


that
two
appointed
special
precinct
election
officers
deliver
18


a
requested
absentee
ballot
to
a
person
who
is
a
resident
or
19


patient
of
a
health
care
facility
or
hospital
in
the
county
20


where
the
person
is
registered
to
vote.
Current
law
also
21


requires
that
the
county
commissioner
of
elections
mail
a
22


requested
absentee
ballot
to
a
person
who
is
a
resident
or
23


patient
of
a
health
care
facility
or
hospital
not
located
in
24


the
county
where
the
person
is
registered
to
vote.
If
a
person
25


becomes
a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
care
facility
or
26


hospital
that
is
not
located
in
the
county
where
the
person
is
27


registered
to
vote
within
three
days
before
an
election
or
on
28


election
day,
the
person
may
designate
a
person
to
deliver
and
29


return
an
absentee
ballot.
30


The
bill
requires
that
two
special
precinct
election
31


officers
appointed
by
the
commissioner
of
the
county
where
32


the
person
is
registered
to
vote
deliver
a
requested
absentee
33


ballot
to
a
person
who
is
a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
34


care
facility
or
hospital
regardless
of
whether
the
health
35

64


care
facility
or
hospital
is
located
in
the
county
in
which
1


the
voter
is
registered
to
vote
and
regardless
of
when
2


the
person
becomes
a
resident
of
the
facility
or
hospital.
3


Correspondingly,
the
bill
strikes
the
requirement
that
the
4


commissioner
mail
the
ballot
if
the
voter
is
a
resident
of
5


a
health
care
facility
or
hospital
not
located
in
the
county
6


where
the
person
is
registered
to
vote.
7


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
8


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
9


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
10


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
11


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
12


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
13


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
