explanation’s

This
bill
relates
to
property
assessment
and
taxation
by
13


modifying
provisions
relating
to
property
assessment
notices
14


and
equalization
order
notices.
15


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
441.23
that
16


authorizes
the
local
assessor,
in
lieu
of
individual
taxpayer
17


notices,
to
provide
notice
to
taxpayers
by
publication
in
the
18


official
newspapers
of
the
county
if
the
valuation
of
a
class
19


of
property
is
uniformly
decreased.
The
bill
also
strikes
a
20


provision
in
Code
section
441.35,
subsection
2,
that
authorizes
21


the
local
board
of
review
to
provide
notice
to
taxpayers
by
22


publication
in
one
of
the
official
newspapers
located
in
23


the
taxing
district
if
the
local
board
of
review
raises
the
24


assessment
of
all
property
in
a
taxing
district
during
the
25


local
board
of
review’s
session
in
an
even-numbered
assessment

year.
27


Current
Code
law
requires
the
department
of
revenue
to,
in
28


each
odd-numbered
year,
order
the
equalization
of
the
levels
of
29


assessment
of
each
class
of
property
in
the
several
assessing
30


jurisdictions
by
adding
to
or
deducting
from
the
valuation
of
31


each
class
of
property
if
the
aggregate
assessed
valuation
of
32


that
class
of
property
is
at
least
5
percent
above
or
below
the
33


valuation
of
that
class
of

H.F.
_____


of
the
final
equalization
order
in
an
official
newspaper
of
1


general
circulation.
The
bill
strikes
the
authority
to
provide
2


such
notice
by
publication
and
instead
requires
the
county
3


auditor
to
provide
individual
notices
mailed
to
each
property
4


owner
or
taxpayer
whose
valuation
has
been
adjusted
by
the
5


equalization
order.
The
bill
provides
that
the
notice
shall
6


contain
the
statement
currently
required
in
published
notices
7


and
also
requires
that
the
notice
contain
a
statement
of
the
8


owner’s
or
taxpayer’s
ability
to
file
a
protest
against
an
9


assessment
adjusted
by
the
equalization
order
with
the
local
10


board
of
review.
11


The
bill
also
modifies
the
period
of
time
for
taxpayer
12


protests
of
an
equalization
order
and
the
dates
of
the
local
13


board
of
review’s
session
to
hear
such
protests.
Current
law
14


allows
such
protests
to
be
filed
on
or
after
October
15
to
and
15


including
October
25.
The
bill
extends
the
period
of
time
16


for
filing
to
November
15.
The
bill
provides
that
the
local
17


board
of
review’s
session
to
hear
protests
begins
November
18


10,
instead
of
October
15,
and
ends
December
10,
instead
of
19


November
15.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
deadline
for
20


completing
the
appeal
procedures
for
equalizations
implemented
21


by
the
assessing
jurisdiction
using
an
alternative
method
of
22


applying
the
equalization
order
is
December
20
instead
of
23


November
30.
24


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
25


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
26


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
27


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
28


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
29


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
30


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
31


The
bill
applies
to
assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
32


January

2015.
