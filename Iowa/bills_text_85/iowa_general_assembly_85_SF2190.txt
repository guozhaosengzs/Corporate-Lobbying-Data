An
Act

1


a
pregnant
inmate
or
detainee,
and
including
effective
date

Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
There
are
serious
known
medical
risks
associated
with
3


the
use
of
restraints
on
pregnant
women,
and
such
use
is
not
an
4


accepted
practice
on
a
nationwide
basis.
5


2.
The
vast
majority
of
female
inmates
or
detainees
in
this
6


state
are
nonviolent
offenders.
7


3.
Restraining
pregnant
prison
inmates
increases
the
8


potential
for
physical
harm
from
an
accidental
trip
or
fall.
9


4.
Freedom
from
physical
restraints
is
especially
critical
10


during
labor,
delivery,
and
postpartum
recovery
after
delivery,
11


because
a
woman
often
needs
to
move
around
during
labor
and
12


recovery.
13


5.
Restraints
on
a
pregnant
woman
can
interfere
with
the
14


ability
of
medical
staff
to
appropriately
assist
in
childbirth
15


or
to
conduct
sudden
emergency
procedures.
