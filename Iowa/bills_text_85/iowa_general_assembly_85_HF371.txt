the

is
subject
to
license
revocation
for
up
to
two
years
13


and

not

for
a
temporary
restricted

14


for

depending
15


on
whether

had
a
previous
revocation
under
Code
16


chapter
321J.
17


Under
current
law,
Iowa’s
implied
consent
law
provides
that
18


a
person
who
operates
a
motor
vehicle
in
this
state
under
19


circumstances
which
give
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
20


the
person
has
been
operating
a
motor
vehicle
in
violation
21


of
Iowa’s
operating-while-intoxicated
law
is
deemed
to
have
22


given
consent
to
the
withdrawal
of
specimens
of
the
person’s
23


blood,
breath,
or
urine
and
to
a
chemical
test
or
tests
of
24


the
specimens
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
alcohol
25


concentration
or
presence
of
a
controlled
substance
or
other
26


drugs.
The
withdrawal
of
the
body
substances
and
the
test
or
27


tests
is
contingent
upon
a
written
request
of
a
peace
officer
28


who,
prior
to
the
request,
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
29


that
the
person
was
operating
a
motor
vehicle
in
violation
30


of
Code
chapter
321J,
under
any
of
a
number
of
conditions,
31


including
but
not
limited
to
whether
the
person
has
been
32


involved
in
a
motor
vehicle
accident
or
collision
resulting
in
33


personal
injury
or
death.
