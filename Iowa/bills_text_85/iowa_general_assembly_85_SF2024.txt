S.F.

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


Under
current
law,
a
motor
vehicle
dealer
who
accepts
a
3


vehicle
for
resale
is
not
required
to
obtain
a
new
certificate
4


of
title
for
the
vehicle,
but
the
dealer
is
required
to
execute
5


and
acknowledge
an
assignment
and
warranty
of
title
upon
the
6


certificate
of
title
and
deliver
it
to
the
subsequent
purchaser
7


of
the
vehicle.
This
process,
known
as
“reassignment”,
is
8


required
in
all
retail
sales
transactions
involving
a
motor
9


vehicle
dealer.
Any
person
who
sells
more
than
six
motor
10


vehicles
during
a
12-month
period
is
considered
to
be
engaged
11


in
the
business
of
selling
motor
vehicles
at
retail
and
12


is
subject
to
dealer
licensing
requirements
and
provisions
13


relating
to
the
transfer
of
ownership
of
motor
vehicles
sold
14


at
retail.
15


This
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“engaged
in
the
business”
16


in
Code
chapter
322
to
allow
a
person
to
sell
up
to
12
motor
17


vehicles
in
a
12-month
period
without
a
dealer’s
license.
18


The
definition
is
further
amended
to
exclude
brokering,
19


accepting
on
consignment,
or
conducting
an
auction
for
the
sale
20


of
motor
vehicles
at
retail,
thereby
exempting
persons
who
21


engage
exclusively
in
those
activities
from
dealer
licensing
22


requirements.
In
addition,
the
bill
amends
definitions
of
23


“dealer”
in
Code
chapter
321
to
exclude
brokers
and
consignees
24


of
motor
vehicles
for
sale
at
retail
and
persons
who
conduct
25


retail
motor
vehicle
auctions
if
such
persons
are
not
otherwise
26


engaged
in
the
business
of
buying,
selling,
or
exchanging
27


vehicles
of
a
type
required
to
be
registered.
Under
the
bill,
28


such
agents
would
not
be
required
to
accept
assignment
of
a
29


certificate
of
title
for
a
vehicle
to
be
offered
for
sale
at
30


retail.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
owner
or
the
owner’s
31


designee
shall
deliver
the
certificate
of
title,
duly
assigned,
32


to
the
purchaser
or
transferee
at
conclusion
of
such
a
sale.
33


Because
of
the
changes
to
the
definitions
of
“dealer”
and
34


“engaged
in
the
business”,
certain
other
provisions
that
apply

to

Code

not
apply
to
brokers,
consignees,
persons
who
conduct
retail

auctions,
and
persons
who
sell
up
to
12
motor
vehicles
in
a

12-month
period,
including

not
limited
to
requirements
for

damage

statements,

and

permits.
