EXPLANATION
28


BACKGROUND.
The
department
of
natural
resources
29


(department)
is
required
to
regulate
confinement
feeding
30


operations
(operations)
under
Code
chapter
459,
the
“Animal
31


Agriculture
Compliance
Act”.
This
bill
amends
provisions
in
32


subchapter
III
which
govern
water
quality,
including
how
and
33


when
manure
from
such
operations
is
to
be
applied
to
land.

H.F.
_____


OPERATION’S
SIZE.
To
some
extent,
the
degree
of
regulation
1


depends
upon
an
operation’s
size
which
is
determined
by
2


calculating
its
animal
unit
capacity;
the
maximum
number
3


of
animal
units
that
may
be
maintained
in
all
confinement
4


buildings
(buildings)
at
any
one
time
(Code
section
459.102).
5


Each
of
various
types
of
animals
are
assigned
a
special
6


equivalency
factor.
For
example,
a
butcher
or
breeding
swine
7


weighing
more
than
55
pounds
has
a
factor
of
0.4
animal
units
8


(Code
section
459.102).
Generally,
when
calculating
the
animal
9


unit
capacity
of
an
operation,
buildings
constructed
as
part
10


of
the
operation
are
included
regardless
of
whether
they
are
11


occupied,
except
if
a
building
has
been
abandoned,
i.e.,
has
12


been
razed
or
converted
to
another
use
(Code
section
459.301).
13


SMALL
ANIMAL
FEEDING
OPERATIONS.
The
current
law
provides
14


a
special
regulatory
exemption
for
small
animal
feeding
15


operations,
which
have
an
animal
unit
capacity
of
500
or
fewer
16


animal
units
(Code
section
459.102).
In
the
example
above,
a
17


confinement
feeding
operation
with
three
buildings
keeping
a
18


maximum
of
400
swine
in
each
of
two
buildings
and
no
animals
in
19


the
third
building
would
not
qualify
as
a
small
animal
feeding
20


operation
if
the
capacity
of
the
three
buildings
were
600,
500,
21


and
300
animal
units,
respectively
(1,400
x
0.4
=
560).
22


REVISING
CURRENT
FORMULA
——
CALCULATING
CONFINEMENT
ANIMAL
23


UNIT
CAPACITY
BASED
ON
USED
AND
UNUSED
BUILDINGS.
This
bill
24


revises
the
current
formula
by
excluding
any
building
that
is
25


not
occupied
regardless
of
whether
it
is
abandoned.
This
is
26


the
same
formula
used
to
calculate
the
animal
unit
capacity
of
27


dry-bedded
confinement
feeding
operations
using
so-called
“hoop
28


buildings”
(Code
section
459B.103).
In
the
example
above,
the
29


confinement
feeding
would
qualify
as
a
small
animal
feeding
30


operation
since
the
third
empty
building
is
no
longer
counted
31


(1,100
x
0.4
=
440).
32


NEW
FORMULA
——
RECLASSIFYING
CONFINEMENT
FEEDING
OPERATIONS
33


BASED
ON
MAXIMUM
NUMBER
OF
ANIMAL
UNITS.
The
bill
allows
a
34


person
to
elect
to
be
exempt
from
filing
a
manure

plan
update
(update)
with
the
department
and
paying
an
1


associated
annual
compliance
fee
(fee)
if
the
person
can
2


reclassify
the
operation
as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
3


using
the
new
formula.
An
update
is
required
to
be
filed
by
a
4


person
who
owns
a
confinement
feeding
operation
or
who
applies
5


manure
from
a
confinement
feeding
operation
located
outside
6


the
state
(Code
section
459.312).
Both
the
original
plan
7


and
the
update
must
include
the
latest
information
regarding
8


manure
application.
Using
the
example
above,
the
operation
9


could
elect
to
be
exempt
as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
10


(800
x
0.4
=
320).
The
bill
provides
that
the
department
11


must
determine
the
period
of
election
so
long
as
the
minimum
12


election
period
equals
the
duration
of
the
updated
plan.
13


However,
the
election
period
automatically
terminates
if
14


the
operation
no
longer
qualifies
as
a
small
animal
feeding
15


operation
as
calculated
using
the
new
formula.
16


NEW
FORMULA
——
ANNUAL
COMPLIANCE
FEE.
The
bill
provides
17


that
a
person
must
now
calculate
the
fee
accompanying
the
18


update
by
applying
the
new
formula.
Using
the
example
above,
19


if
the
operation
were
not
exempted
as
a
small
animal
feeding
20


operation,
the
person
who
would
have
paid
a
fee
of
$84
(560
x
15
21


cents)
under
the
current
formula
would
pay
$48
(320
x
15
cents)
22


under
the
new
formula.
23


CIVIL
PENALTIES.
A
person
who
violates
Code
chapter
468,
24


subchapter
III
is
subject
to
a
civil
penalty.
The
department
25


is
authorized
to
impose
a
range
of
civil
penalties
based
26


on
a
number
of
criteria.
The
general
civil
penalty
cannot
27


exceed
$10,000
(Code
sections
459.603
and
455B.109).
A
28


person
violating
a
provision
is
also
subject
to
judicial
29


action
brought
by
the
attorney
general
(Code
sections
459.603
30


and
455B.191).
The
general
civil
penalty
applicable
for
a
31


violation
cannot
exceed
$5,000.
