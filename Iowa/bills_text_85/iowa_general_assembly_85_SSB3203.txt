DIVISION
I
——
STATE
BOARD
OF
TAX
REVIEW.
Division
I
relates
8


to
the
state
board
of
tax
review.
The
state
board
of
tax
review
9


(board)
is
an
independent,
bipartisan
board
consisting
of
10


three
members
appointed
by
the
governor
and
confirmed
by
the
11


senate.
One
of
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
board
is
to
review
12


final
decisions
of
the
director,
including
but
not
limited
to
13


final
decisions
issued
by
the
director
in
a
contested
case.
14


The
board
also
has
the
original
jurisdiction
to
review
the
15


director’s
assessments
and
valuations
of
centrally
assessed
16


property
for
purposes
of
property
taxation,
which
means
the
17


taxpayer
appeals
the
assessment
or
valuation
of
the
director
18


directly
to
the
board.
Both
the
taxpayer
and
the
director
have
19


the
right
to
appeal
a
decision
of
the
board
to
district
court.
20


The
division
amends
the
types
of
decisions
of
the
director
21


that
may
be
reviewed
by
the
board
to
specify
that
only
22


decisions
made
under
Code
Title
X,
subtitle
2
(property
taxes),
23


may
be
appealed
to
the
board.
As
a
result,
decisions
of
the
24


director
with
regard
to
income
taxes,
franchise
taxes,
sales
25


and
use
taxes,
and
various
excise
and
other
taxes
will
no
26


longer
be
appealable
to
the
board
and
must
instead
be
appealed
27


directly
to
district

The

takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
to

appeals
made

of

proceedings.
1


Under
current
law,
when
a
taxpayer
appeals
a
decision
of
the
2


director
and
no
settlement
can
be
reached
between
the
parties,
3


the
director
grants
a
contested
case
hearing
pursuant
to
the
4


provisions
of
Code
chapter
17A
(Iowa
administrative
procedures
5


Act).
Following
a
contested
case
decision,
the
director
issues
6


a
final
decision.
The
director
can
and
often
does
transfer
7


contested
cases
to
an
administrative
law
judge
who
presides
8


over
the
hearing
and
issues
a
proposed
decision.
When
this
9


occurs,
the
director
may
adopt
the
proposed
decision
as
the
10


final
decision
of
the
department,
or
may
reverse
or
modify
11


the
proposed
decision
according
to
the
standards
provided
in
12


the
Iowa
administrative
procedures
Act.
Following
the
final
13


decision
of
the
director,
a
taxpayer
may
appeal
the
decision
14


to
the
state
board
of
tax
review
or
may
seek
judicial
review
of
15


the
decision.
16


The
division
requires
the
department
of
revenue
to
adopt
17


small
case
proceedings
that
may
be
used
at
the
election
of
the
18


taxpayer,
and
shall
be
in
lieu
of
a
contested
case
hearing.
19


The
department
is
required
to
adopt
rules
relating
to
small
20


case
proceedings,
including
but
not
limited
to
the
types
21


of
actions
of
the
director
and
amounts
of
tax
that
will
be
22


considered
eligible
for
small
case
proceedings.
The
department
23


is
also
required
to
adopt
rules
relating
to
the
transfer
to
24


the
small
case
proceedings
of
eligible
cases
pending
before
25


the
director
on
the
effective
date
of
the
division.
Actions
26


of
the
director
or
department
relating
to
property
taxes
are
27


not
eligible
for
the
small
case
proceedings.
The
department
28


may
refuse
use
of
the
small
case
proceedings
to
a
taxpayer
29


for
good
cause.
The
division
requires
small
case
proceedings
30


to
be
informal
and
allows
the
department
to
dispense
with
31


or
otherwise
modify
provisions
relating
to
formal
contested
32


case
proceedings
such
as
the
recording
and
transcribing
33


of
proceedings,
the
creation
of
a
detailed
case
record,
ex

communications,
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
