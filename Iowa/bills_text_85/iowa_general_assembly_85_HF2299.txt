The
general

finds
all
of
the
following:
14


1.
Renewable
energy
production
and
energy
efficiency
15


improvements
to
residential,
commercial,
and
industrial
real
16


property,
are
necessary
to
address
the
issue
of
consumer
energy
17


bill
stabilization
and
global
climate
change.
18


2.
The
initial
investment
required
to
make
residential,
19


commercial,
or
industrial
real
property
more
energy-efficient
20


or
to
utilize
renewable
energy
prevents
many
property
owners
21


from
making
such
improvements.
To
make
renewable
energy
22


production
or
energy
efficiency
improvements
more
affordable
23


and
to
promote
their
purchase
and
installation,
it
is
necessary
24


to
authorize
an
alternative
procedure
for
owners
of
a
residence
25


or
business
to
finance
such
improvements.

The

declares
that
a

purpose
27


shall
be

by
authorizing
cities

to
establish
28


property-assessed
clean
energy
programs
and
authorizing
the

After

a

city
or
county
may,
by
resolution,
authorize
and
issue
bonds
in

anticipation
of
the
collection
of
unpaid
special

However,
the

All
special

are

must
state
11


on

that
they
are
issued
under
the
provisions
of
this

chapter,
and
are
payable
as

both
principal
and
interest
from

of

Such

may
bear
14


interest
at
a
rate
not
exceeding
that
permitted
by

15


74A
payable
annually
or

the

the

way
to
25


distinguish
them
from
other
improvement
bonds
of
the
city
or

designate
the

for
27


the
improvement.
Improvement
bonds
issued
for
any

28


must
bear
the
