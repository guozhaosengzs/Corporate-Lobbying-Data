of

The
bill
requires
that
a
person
provide
certain
proof
of
5


identification
at
the
time
that
the
person
votes
and
creates
a
6


criminal
offense
for
falsely
swearing
certain
related
oaths
and
7


affidavits.
8


The
bill
requires
that
a

Those

The

bill

absentee
registration
23


by

25


The
bill
provides
that,

26


in

to
vote,
a
person
may
establish
proof
of

by

and
of
a
person
who
provides
their
own
proof

The

falsely
swear
to
or
affirm
an
oath
pursuant
to
this
2


provision
or
to
falsely

The
bill

requires
that
the
oath
advise
both
persons
that
falsely
stating

or
attesting
to
a
voter’s
identity
is
a
class
“D”

A

class
“D”
felony
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
6


five
years
and
a
fine
of
at

The
bill
provides
that
an
attesting
person
is
prohibited
from
8


signing
any
additional
such
oaths
for
the

election.
9


The
bill
provides
that
if
a

name
is

the
election
10


register
or
the

has
registered
to
vote
at
the
polling

but
the

is
unable

refuses
to
present
proof
of
12


identification,
or
if
the
precinct
election
official
determines
13


that
the
proof
of
identification
does
not
meet
the
specified
14


requirements,
the
person
shall
be
offered
the
option
to
vote
15


a
provisional

If
a

is
casting
a
provisional
16


ballot
under
these
circumstances,
the
person
shall
receive
a
17


printed
statement
giving

and
notice
that
the
person
is
required
to
show
19


acceptable

before
the
provisional

can
20


be
counted.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
a
voter
casting
21


a
provisional
ballot
for
this
reason
may
execute
an
affidavit
22


in
the
form
prescribed
by
the
state
commissioner
of

23


affirming
that
the

is
the

affirming
that
the

is
either
indigent

without
the
payment
of
a
fee
or
26


that
the
voter
has
a
religious
objection
to

27


The
bill
makes
it
a
class
“D”
felony
to
falsify
an
affidavit
28


that
attests
to
identity.
A
class
“D”

a

The

also
provides
that

any
