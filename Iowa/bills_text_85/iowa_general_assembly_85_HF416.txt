1


The
bill
provides
that
an
individual
who,
while
acting
2


as
an
attorney
in
fact
or
agent
under
a
power
of
attorney,
3


financially
exploited
the
principal,
is
prohibited
from
4


receiving
any
property,
benefit,
or
other
interest
following
5


the
death
of
the
principal
as
an
heir,
distributee,
6


beneficiary,
appointee,
or
in
any
other
capacity
whether
7


the
property,
benefit,
or
other
interest
passed
under
any
8


form
of
title
registration,
testamentary
or
nontestamentary
9


instrument,
intestacy,
renunciation,
or
any
other
circumstance.
10


The
property,
benefit,
or
other
interest
shall
pass
as
if
11


the
attorney
in
fact
or
agent
who
financially
exploited
12


the
principal
predeceased
the
decedent.
Additionally,
an
13


individual
who,
while
acting
as
the
attorney
in
fact
or
agent
14


under
a
power
of
attorney,
financially
exploited
the
principal,
15


and
who
is
a
named
beneficiary
of
a
bond,
life
insurance
16


policy,
or
any
other
contractual
arrangement,
following
the
17

of
an
older
individual.
The

vary
depending

value
of
the
resources
involved
in
the
crime.
The
bill
31


defines

for
the
purposes
of
the
crime
of
32


financial
exploitation
of
an
older
individual.
33


The
bill
directs

legislative
council
to
