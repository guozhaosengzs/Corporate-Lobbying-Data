the
terms
used
to
describe
the
standards
for
use
by
school
1


districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
schools.
The
bill
directs
2


the
state
board
to
adopt
rules
to
prohibit
the
department
from
3


entering
into
a
contract
or
memorandums
of
understanding
with

another

implementation
of
statewide

or

standards
6


unless
the
contract
or
memorandum
is
presented
before
the

The
bill
provides
that
the
rules
may
only
8


allow
the
department
to
adopt
and
implement
the
Iowa
excellence
9


academic
standard
and
assessment
standards
identified
or
10


developed
by
Iowa
educators.
11


Each

school
is
12


encouraged
to
develop
local
methods
and
materials
to
assist
13


students
in
reaching
the
standards
set
forth
under
the
Iowa
14


excellence
academic
standard.
15


The
bill
replaces
the
terms
“core
curriculum”,
“Iowa
16


core
curriculum”,
and
“Iowa
common
core”,
which
were
used
to
17


describe
the
academic
standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
18


with
the
term
“Iowa
excellence
academic
standard”.
Also,
19


provisions
directing
school
districts
to
cooperate
with
each
20


eighth
grade
student
on
a
core
curriculum
plan
to
meet
core
21


curriculum
requirements
are
amended
to
replace
“core

plan”
with
“Iowa
excellence
academic
standard
plan”
and
“core
23


curriculum
requirements”
with
“the
Iowa
excellence
academic
24


standard”.
The
term
“core
content
standards”,
which
was
used
25


to
describe
the
assessment
standards
adopted
by
the
state
26


board,
is
replaced
with
the
term
“assessment
standards”.
The
27


assessment
standards
will
remain
applicable
to
all
students
28


in
kindergarten
through
grade
12
in
every
school
district
and
29


accredited

Corresponding
changes
are
made
30


throughout
the
Code,
and
obsolete
language
is
eliminated.
31


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
32


section
25B.3.
The
bill
requires
that
the
state
cost
of
33


any
