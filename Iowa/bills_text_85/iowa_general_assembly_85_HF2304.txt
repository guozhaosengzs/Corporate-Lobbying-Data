who

the
age

20


or
incurred
the
requisite
disability
status.
The
provision
21


of
these
credits
is
triggered
by
an
appropriation
to
and
22


payment
from
the
low-income
tax
credit
and
reimbursement
fund
23


established
in
Code
section
425.40.
An
appropriation
to
this
24


fund
has
not
occurred
since
the
fund’s
creation.
25


The
bill
makes
similar
changes
to
the
credit
schedules
and
26


eligibility
for
the
credits
and
reimbursement
specified
by
law
27


to
be
paid
from
the
low-income
tax
credit
and
reimbursement
28


fund
under
Code
section
425.40.
29


The
bill
provides
for
an
inflationary
adjustment
to
the
new
30


income
threshold
amounts
established
in
the
bill.
31


As
a
result
of
modifying
the
income
threshold
amounts,
the
32


bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
the
income
limitation
33


eligibility
for
filing
a
claim
for
a
special
assessment
credit
34


under
Code
