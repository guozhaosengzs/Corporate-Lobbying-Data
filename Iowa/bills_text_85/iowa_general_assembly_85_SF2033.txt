SERVICE
DOG
ABUSE
——
NEW
CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.
The
bill
creates
21


a
criminal
offense
referred
to
as
service
dog
abuse.
A
service
22


dog
is
a
dog
specially
trained
to
assist
a
person
with
a
23


disability.
Code
chapter
216C
provides
rights
to
persons
24


with
disabilities
including
the
right
to
be
accompanied
by
a
25


service
dog
(Code
section
216C.11).
This
new
offense
would
be
26


committed
when
a
person
owns
or
possesses
a
dog
which
attacks
27


a
service
dog,
if
the
service
dog
was
individually
trained
to
28


perform
functions
related
to
a
diagnosed
disability.
The
bill
29


specifically
excludes
certain
circumstances
including
when
the
30


two
dogs
are
owned
by
the
same
person,
or
a
service
dog
was
31


either
not
under
the
control
of
its
owner
or
handler
or
behaved
32


aggressively.
33


SERVICE
DOG
ABUSE
——
PENALTIES
AND
RESTITUTION.
Generally,
34


a
person
convicted
of
service
dog
abuse
is
guilty
of
a
simple
35


-2-


LSB

S.F.

misdemeanor.
However,
a
person
owning
or
possessing
the
1


attacking
dog
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
attack
2


was
directly
caused
by
the
person’s
willful,
malicious,
or
3


reckless
act;
the
service
dog
was
critically
injured
or
killed;
4


or
the
person
has
been
convicted
three
or
more
times
in
the
5


previous
10
years
of
an
offense
under
the
Code
chapter.
The
6


person
must
also
pay
restitution
to
the
victim
for
certain
7


expenses
incurred
by
the
attack,
including
for
veterinary
care
8


or
for
the
replacement
of
the
service
dog
(see
Code
chapter
9


910).
10


BACKGROUND.
Animal
abuse
is
committed
when
a
person
11


intentionally
causes
an
animal
injury
or
disfigurement
or
kills
12


an
animal.
A
person
committing
animal
abuse
is
guilty
of
an
13


aggravated
misdemeanor
(Code
section
717B.2).
Animal
neglect
14


is
committed
when
a
person
who
confines
an
animal
fails
to
15


properly
care
for
the
animal
or
otherwise
injures
or
kills
an
16


animal
in
a
manner
that
causes
unjustified
suffering.
A
person
17


committing
animal
neglect
is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor,
18


unless
the
person
intentionally
commits
an
act
which
results
19


in
serious
injury
to
or
the
death
of
the
animal.
In
those
20


circumstances
the
person
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor
21


(Code
section
717B.3).
Animal
torture
is
committed
when
a
22


person
inflicts
severe
physical
pain
upon
an
animal
with
a
23


depraved
or
sadistic
intent
to
cause
prolonged
suffering
or
24


death.
For
the
first
conviction,
the
person
is
guilty
of
25


an
aggravated
misdemeanor
and
for
the
second
or
subsequent
26


conviction,
the
person
is
guilty
of
a
class
“D”
felony.
The
27


sentencing
order
must
also
order
the
person
to
submit
to
28


psychological
evaluation
and
treatment
(Code
section
717B.3A).
29


Injury
or
interference
with
a
police
service
dog
is
committed
30


when
a
person
knowingly,
willfully,
or
maliciously
abuses
a
31


police
service
dog.
A
person
committing
the
offense
is
guilty
32


of
a
serious
misdemeanor,
unless
the
person’s
act
involves
33


torture,
serious
injury,
or
death.
In
those
circumstances
the
34


person
is
guilty
of
a
class
“D”
felony
(Code
section
717B.9).
