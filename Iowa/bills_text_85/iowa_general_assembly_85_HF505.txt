EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
approval
and
imposition
of
local
4


option
taxes.
5


Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
imposition
of
local
6


option
taxes,
including
a
local
option
sales
and
services
tax.
7


Currently,
such
a
proposed
tax
is
only
presented
to
the
voters
8


of
a
whole
county
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
signed
by
9


eligible
electors
of
the
county
equal
in
number
to
five
percent
10


of
the
persons
in
the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
preceding
11


general
election
or
upon
receipt
by
the
county
commissioner
of
12


elections
of
motions
requesting
such
submission,
adopted
by
the
13


governing
bodies
of
the
cities
located
within
the
county
or
the
14


governing
body
of
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
15


county,
representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
population
of
the
16


county.
17


The
bill
amends
the
methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
18


the
local
option
sales
and
services
tax
to
the
voters
by
19


allowing
the
eligible
electors
of
individual
cities
and
the
20


unincorporated
area
of
a
county
to
file
a
petition
for
an
21


election
to
be
held
in
the
petitioning
jurisdiction
if
such
22


petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
city
or
the
23


unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
applicable,
equal
in
24


number
to
five
percent
of
the
persons
in
the
applicable
city
25


or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
26


preceding
general
election.
27


The
bill
also
removes
the
requirement
that

to
have
28


the
local
sales
and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
29


motions
must
be
approved
by
cities
or
the
county
for
the

the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area
to
approve
a
33


motion
for
an

on
the
local

and
services
tax
to
34


be
held
in
only

imposition
of
a
local

tax
in
a
city
that
is
4


located
in
more
than
one
county.
5


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
proposition
for
the

6


of
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
submitted
to
the
voters
of
7


a
city
or
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
fails
to
gain
8


approval,
it
shall
not
be
resubmitted
to
the
voters
of
that
9


jurisdiction
in
substantially
the
same
form
for
a
period
of
10


three

of
a
city
12

The
bill
does
not
affect

as
the
result
of
a
19


petition
received
or
a
motion
approved
before
July
1,
2013.
20

bill
