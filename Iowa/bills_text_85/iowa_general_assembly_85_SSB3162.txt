EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

by

This
bill
relates
to
the
rebate
of
sales
tax
imposed
12


and
collected
at
certain
automobile
racetrack
facilities
13


(facility).
14


Under
current
law,
the
owner
or
operator
of
a
facility
may
15


receive
a
rebate
of
the
sales
tax
imposed
and
collected
by
16


retailers
at
the
facility.
The
rebate
is
limited
to
sales
17


occurring
before
January
1,
2016,
and
is
limited
to
a
total
of
18


$12.5
million.
The
rebate
ceases
if
a
“change
in
control”,
as
19


defined
in
statute,
occurs.
A
change
in
control
occurs
when
20


the
original
owners
cease
to
own
at
least
25
percent
of
the
21


voting
equity
interests
in
the
legal
entity
that
is
the
owner
22


or
operator
of
the
facility
or
when
less
than
25
percent
of
23


the
equity
interests
in
the
legal
entity
that
is
the
owner
24


or
operator
of
the
facility
are
owned
by
individuals
who
are
25


residents
of
Iowa
or
an
Iowa
corporation
or
a
combination
26


of
both.
“Iowa
corporation”
is
defined
in
statute
as
a
27


corporation
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
Iowa
where
at
least
28


25
percent
of
the
corporation’s
equity
interests
are
owned
by
29


individuals
who
are
residents
of
Iowa.

The
bill
extends
the
rebate
by
10
years
to
sales
occurring
31


before
January
1,
2026,
and
extends
the
repeal
date
of
the
32


rebate
to
the
same
date.
The
bill
changes
the
definition
33


of

by
removing
the
requirement
that
the
34


original
owners
retain
at
