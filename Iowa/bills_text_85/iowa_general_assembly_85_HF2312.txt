EXPLANATION
10


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


Under
current
law,
an
equipment
dealer
who
rebuilds
or
13


installs
equipment
on
new
vehicles
can
be
licensed
as
a
14


wholesaler
in
order
to
acquire
new
vehicles
without
having
15


to
title
and
register
the
vehicles
or
pay
the
fee
for
new
16


registration.
However,
after
such
a
vehicle
has
been
modified,
17


the
retail
sale
of
the
modified
vehicle
must
be
completed
18


through
a
franchised
dealer
of
the
vehicle’s
line
make.
19


This
bill
establishes
an
alternative
process
for
an
20


equipment
dealer
with
a
motor
vehicle
dealer’s
license
to
21


acquire
a
new
completed
motor
vehicle
without
owing
the
fee
22


for
new
registration
and,
after
modifying
the
vehicle,
sell
it
23


directly
to
a
business
or
government
entity
as
a
used
vehicle.
24


Under
the
bill,
a
new
completed
motor
vehicle
purchased
at
25


retail
by
an
equipment
dealer
licensed
to
sell
motor
vehicles
26


is
exempt
from
the
fee
for
new
registration,
provided
that
27


three
requirements
are
met:
28


1.
The
equipment
dealer
either
rebuilds
the
new
completed
29


motor
vehicle
by
fabricating,
altering,
adding,
or
replacing
30


essential
parts,
components,
or
equipment
for
the
purpose
31


of
building
an
ambulance,
rescue
vehicle,
fire
vehicle,
or
32


towing
or
recovery
vehicle;
or
installs
cranes,
hook
loaders,
33


buckets,
aerial
ladders,
tanks,
or
special
equipment
on
the
new
34


completed
motor
truck
having
a
gross
vehicle
weight
rating
of
35

H.F.
2312


fourteen
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
or
more.
1


2.
The
total
value
of
the
work
performed
and
the
equipment
2


installed
on
the
vehicle
equals
or
exceeds
80
percent
of
the
3


purchase
price
paid
for
the
new
vehicle.
4


3.
The
equipment
dealer
sells
the
modified
vehicle
as
a
used
5


vehicle
to
a
purchaser
that
is
a
business
or
government
entity,
6


and
not
an
individual
consumer.
7


Because
the
equipment
dealer’s
acquisition
of
a
new
8


completed
motor
vehicle
would
be
through
a
retail
sale,
the
9


equipment
dealer
would
be
required
to
obtain
a
certificate
10


of
title
and
registration
for
the
vehicle
under
the
bill.
11


However,
the
bill
exempts
the
equipment
dealer
from
annual
12


registration
fees,
provided
that
the
equipment
dealer
operates
13


the
vehicle
only
for
purposes
incidental
to
a
resale
and
14


displays
a
dealer
plate
on
the
vehicle
or
does
not
drive
the
15


vehicle
or
permit
it
to
be
driven
upon
the
highways.
