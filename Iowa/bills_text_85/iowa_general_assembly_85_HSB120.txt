EXPLANATION
1


This
bill
relates
to
the
issuance
of
and
violations
of
civil
2


protective
orders
and
criminal
no-contact
orders,
and
modifies
3


penalties.
4


Current
law
defines
a
no-contact
order
as
a
court
order
5


issued
in
a
criminal
proceeding
requiring
a
defendant
to
have
6


no
contact
with
the
alleged
victim,
persons
residing
with
the
7


alleged
victim,
or
members
of
the
alleged
victim’s
immediate
8


family,
and
to
refrain
from
harassing
the
alleged
victim,
9


persons
residing
with
the
alleged
victim,
or
members
of
the
10


alleged
victim’s
family.
A
protective
order
is
defined
as
a
11


protective
order
issued
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
232
(juvenile
12


justice),
a
court
order
or
court-approved
consent
agreement
13


entered
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
236
(civil
domestic
abuse),
14


including
a
valid
foreign
protective
order,
a
temporary
or
15


permanent
protective
order
or
order
to
vacate
the
homestead
16


under
Code
chapter
598
(dissolution
of
marriage
and
domestic
17


relations),
an
order
that
establishes
conditions
of
release
18


or
is
a
protective
order
or
sentencing
order
in
a
criminal
19


prosecution
arising
from
a
domestic
abuse
assault
(criminal
20


domestic
abuse),
or
a
civil
injunction
issued
to
restrain
21


harassment
or
intimidation
of
victims
or
witnesses
in
a
22


criminal
case.
The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
protective
23


order
to
eliminate
language
allowing
for
the
issuance
of
a
24


protective
order
in
criminal
proceedings.
The
bill
amends
a
25


related
provision
allowing
the
court
to
issue
a
no-contact
26


order
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
a
protective
order.
27


Current
law
allows
a
court
to
issue
a
temporary
no-contact
28


order
and
a
permanent
no-contact
order.
The
bill
eliminates
29


the
distinction
between
temporary
and
permanent
no-contact
30


orders.
31


Current
law
provides
for
a
mandatory
arrest
procedure
for
32


violations
of
no-contact
orders
but
not
for
violations
of
33


protective
orders.
The
bill
amends
this
provision
to
provide
34


that
a
person
who
violates
a
protective
order
is
also
subject

to

Under
current
law,
if
a
person
violates
a
no-contact
order
or
2


a
protective
order,
the
person
may
be
charged
with
a
criminal
3


offense
(simple
misdemeanor)
or
may
be
held
to
be
in
contempt
4


of
court.
The
bill
eliminates
the
criminal
offense
option
5


for
violations
of
no-contact
orders
or
protective
orders.
A
6


person
held
in
contempt
for
a
violation
of
a
no-contact
order
7


or
a
protective
order
is
subject
to

for
a
minimum
of
seven

and
a
maximum
of
180
