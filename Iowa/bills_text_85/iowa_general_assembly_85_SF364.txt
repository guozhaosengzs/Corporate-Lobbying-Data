EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
collection
of
8


the
fee
for
new
registration
from
vehicle
owners
who
attempt
9


to
evade
payment
of
the
fee,
including
resident
owners
who
10


establish
a
shell
business
in
another
state.
In
addition,
11


the
bill
provides
for
annual
registration
fees
for
electric
12


vehicles
based
on
the
weight
and
value
of
the
vehicle.
13


Under
current
law,
the
nonresident
owner
of
a
motor
vehicle
14


which
is
operated
within
this
state
by
a
resident
of
this
15


state
must
register
the
vehicle
in
Iowa
and
pay
the
same
fees
16


required
for
registration
of
a
vehicle
by
a
resident
owner.
17


However,
registration
is
not
required
for
a
vehicle
owned
by
18


a
nonresident
and
operated
in
this
state
by
an
Iowa
resident
19


for
a
temporary
period
of
not
more
than
90
days.
The
bill
20


provides
that
if
a
vehicle
owned
by
a
nonresident
is
located
in
21


Iowa
for
more
than
90
consecutive
or
nonconsecutive
days
and
is
22


operated
by
an
Iowa
resident
during
that
time,
the
vehicle
is
23


not
considered
to
be
in
the
state
temporarily.
24


The
bill
provides
that
on
or
after
July
1,
2013,
if
the
25


department
of
transportation,
in
consultation
with
the
26


department
of
revenue,
determines
that
the
nonresident
owner
27


of
a
vehicle
is
a
partnership,
limited
liability
company,
or
28


corporation
that
is
a
shell
business,
there
is
a
rebuttable
29


presumption
that
the
Iowa
resident
in
control
of
the
vehicle
30


is
the
actual
owner
of
the
vehicle,
that
the
vehicle
is
31


subject
to
registration
in
this
state,
and
that
the
fee
for
32


new
registration
for
the
vehicle
is
owed
by
the
Iowa
resident.
33


The
90-day
grace
period
does
not
apply
to
such
a
vehicle,
34


and
the
department
of
transportation
shall
notify
the

resident
in
control
of
the
vehicle
of
the
requirement
to
obtain
1


a
certificate
of
title
and
registration
for
the
vehicle
and
2


pay
the
applicable
fee
for
registration
within
30
days
of
the
3


date
of
the
notice.
The
bill
lists
factors
that
identify
a
4


shell
business,
including
but
not
limited
to
lacking
a
specific
5


business
activity
or
purpose,
failing
to
maintain
a
physical
6


location
in
the
foreign
jurisdiction,
failing
to
employ
7


individuals
and
issue
federal
W-2
forms,
and
failing
to
file
8


federal
or
state
tax
returns.
Factors
used
to
identify
the
9


person
in
control
of
the
vehicle
include
that
the
person
was
10


the
original
purchaser
of
the
vehicle;
that
the
person
operated
11


or
stored
the
vehicle
in
Iowa
for
any
period
of
time;
that
the
12


person
is
a
partner,
member,
or
shareholder
of
the
nonresident
13


partnership,
limited
liability
company,
or
corporation
that
14


purports
to
be
the
owner
of
the
vehicle;
or
that
the
person
is
15


insured
to
operate
the
vehicle.
16


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
willfully
attempts
to
17


evade
payment
of
the
fee
for
new
registration
is
guilty
of
18


a
fraudulent
practice.
The
bill
also
provides
that
a
person
19


who
is
found
to
be
in
control
of
a
vehicle
that
is
owned
by
a
20


shell
business
and
for
which
the
fee
for
new
registration
is
21


unpaid
is
guilty
of
a
fraudulent
practice.
In
addition
to
any
22


criminal
penalty,
the
person
shall
be
assessed
a
penalty
of
23


75
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
fee
unpaid
and
required
to
be
24


paid.
These
are
the
same
penalties
that
apply
for
making
a
25


false
statement
in
regard
to
the
purchase
price
of
a
vehicle
26


subject
to
the
fee
for
new
registration.
27


Code
section
321.116,
which
establishes
an
annual
28


registration
fee
of
$25
for
an
electric
motor
vehicle
up
to
29


five
model
years
old
and
a
fee
of
$15
thereafter,
is
repealed.
30


As
a
result,
electric
motor
vehicles
will
be
subject
to
31


registration
fees
based
on
the
weight
and
value
of
the
vehicle.
32


The
change
applies
for
registration
years
beginning
on
or
after
33


January
1,
2014.
However,
current
fees
will
continue
to
apply

to
registration
renewals

vehicles
