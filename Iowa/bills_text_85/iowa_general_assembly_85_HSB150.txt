The

3


July
1
of

7

to
report

8


to
the

On
or
before
a
date
established
by
the
9


department
of
revenue,
the
county
auditor
prepares
a
statement,
10


based
upon
the
report
listing
for
each
taxing
district
in
the
11


county
the
difference
between
assessed
and
actual
values
of
12


such
property
located
in
the
taxing
district,
the
tax
levy
rate
13


per
$1,000
of
assessed
value
for
each
taxing
district,
and
14


the
property
tax
replacement
claim
for

15


The
replacement
claim
is
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
16


assessed
valuation
of
all
such
property
located
in
the
taxing
17


district
and
assessed
for
the
applicable
assessment
year

18


the
total
actual
value
of
all
such
property
located
in
the
19


taxing
district
for
the
same
assessment
year,
multiplied
by
20


the
tax
rate
per
$1,000
of
assessed
value
specified
for
the
21


taxing
district,
and
then
divided
by
$1,000.
If
the
difference
22


between
the
actual
and
assessed
values
is
zero,
there
is
no
23


replacement
claim
for
the
taxing
district
for
that
year.
24


Replacement
claims
are
paid
to
each
county
treasurer
in
25


equal
installments
in
September
and
March
of
each
year.
The
26


county
treasurer
apportions
the
replacement
claim
payments
27


among
the
eligible
taxing
districts
in
the
county.
28


The
bill
defines
a
tax
increment
financing
district
in
29


an
urban
renewal
area
as
a
taxing
district
for
purposes
of
30


allocation
of
replacement
moneys

provides
for
the
method
of
31


allocation
in
those
districts.

The
