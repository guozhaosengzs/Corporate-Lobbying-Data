EXPLANATION
23


This
bill
relates
to
matters
under
the
purview
of
the
banking
24


division
of
the
department
of
commerce.
25


The
bill
amends
provisions
which
currently
prohibit
a
26


depository,
defined
as
a
bank
or
credit
union
in
which
public
27


funds
are
deposited,
from
directly
or
indirectly
paying
28


interest
to
a
public
officer
on
a
demand
deposit
of
public
29


funds,
and
prohibit
a
public
officer
from
taking
or
receiving
30


interest.
The
bill
provides
that
a
depository
may
pay
interest
31


to
a
public
officer
on
deposits
of
public
funds,
and
a
public
32


officer
may
take
or
receive
it.
The
bill
deletes
a
provision
33


that
the
previous
prohibition
did
not
apply
to
interest
on
time
34


certificates
of
deposit
or
savings
accounts
for
public
funds.

The
bill
deletes
a
provision
characterizing
a
borrowing
1


group,
for
purposes
of
loans
and
extensions
of
credit
by
a
2


state
bank,
as
including
a
person
and
any
legal
entity
where
3


the
interests
of
a
group
of
more
than
one
borrower,
or
any
4


combination
of
the
members
of
the
group,
are
so
interrelated
5


that
they
should
be
considered
a
unit
for
the
purpose
of
6


applying
lending
limit
limitations.
7


The
bill
makes
several
similar
modifications
throughout
8


Code
chapters
533A
(relating
to
engaging
in
the
business
of
9


debt
management),
533C
(relating
to
engaging
in
the
business
10


of
money
transmission
and
engaging
in
the
business
of
currency
11


exchange),
and
533D
(relating
to
engaging
in
a
delayed
deposit
12


service
business).
The
bill
provides
that
the
superintendent
13


of
banking
may
authorize
applicants
and
licensees
to
be
14


licensed
through
a
nationwide
licensing
system
and
to
pay
15


the
corresponding
system
processing
fees,
and
that
the
16


superintendent
may
establish
by
rule
or
order
new
requirements
17


including
but
not
limited
to
requirements
that
applicants,
18


including
officers
and
directors
and
those
who
have
control
of
19


the
applicant,
submit
to
fingerprinting
and
criminal
history
20


checks.
The
bill
states
that
in
order
to
reduce
the
points
of
21


contact
which
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
may
have
to
22


maintain
the
superintendent
may
use
the
nationwide
licensing
23


system
as
a
channeling
agent
for
requesting
information
from
24


and
distributing
information
to
the
United
States
department
of
25


justice
or
other
governmental
agency,
or
to
or
from
any
other
26


source
so
directed
by
the
superintendent.
27


Also,
with
reference
to
Code
chapters
533A,
533C,
and
28


533D,
the
bill
provides
that
the
superintendent
may
receive
29


documents,
materials,
or
other
information,
including
otherwise
30


confidential
and
privileged
documents,
materials,
or
other
31


information,
through
a
nationwide
licensing
system
and
from
32


other
local,
state,
federal,
or
international
regulatory
33


agencies,
the
conference
of
state
bank
supervisors
and
34


its
affiliates
and
subsidiaries,
the
national
association

and

and
any
other

associations,
and
shall
2


maintain
as
confidential
and
privileged
any
such
document,
3


material,
or
other
information
received
with
notice
or
the
4


understanding
that
it
is
confidential
or
privileged
under
the
5


laws
of
the
jurisdiction
that
is
the
source
of
the
document,
6


material,
or
other
information.
7


Additionally,
with
reference
to
Code
chapters
533A,
533C,
8


and
533D,
the
bill
makes
licensure
expiration
and
renewal
dates
9


consistent
as
December
1
for
renewal
and
either
December
31
or
10


January
1
(in
the
case
of
a
delayed
deposit
services
business)
11


for
expiration.
12


The
bill
provides
transition
provisions
specifying
that
13


licenses
which
would
otherwise
have
expired
on
or
before
the
14


bill’s
effective
date
of
July
1,
2013,
shall
remain
in
full
15


force
and
effect
until
the
expiration
date
as
modified
by
the
16


bill.
17


The
bill
deletes
outdated
references
to
licensure
under
Code
18


chapter
533B,
Code
2003,
and
related
transition
provisions,
19


contained
in
Code
section
533C.904.
20


The
bill
adds
to
confidentiality
provisions
relating
to
the
21


mortgage
licensing
Act
contained
in
Code
section
535D.15.
The
22


bill
states
that,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
Code
23


chapter,
all
papers,
documents,
examination
reports,
and
other
24


writings
relating
to
the
supervision
of
licensees
are
not
25


public
records
and
are
not
subject
to
disclosure
under
Code
26


chapter
22.
27


The
bill
changes
the
requirements
for
the
five
real
estate
28


appraiser
members
of
the
Iowa
real
estate
appraiser
board
29


to
require
that
they
be
actively
engaged
in
practice
as
a
30


certified
real
estate
appraiser
and
shall
have
been
so
engaged
31


for
five
years
preceding
their
appointment,
with
at
least
32


the
last
two
years
in
this
state.
The
bill
makes
conforming
33


changes
consistent
with
this
modification,
and
provides
34


that
vacancies
occurring
during
a
term
shall
be
filled
by

H.F.
353


appointment
by
the
governor
for
the
unexpired
term.
The
1


bill
permits
a
member
to
serve
for
three
consecutive
terms,
2


an
increase
from
the
current
limit
of
two
such
terms,
and
3


states
that
appointment
to
fill
an
unexpired
term
shall
not
4


be
considered
a
complete
term
for
this
purpose.
The
bill
5


authorizes
members
to
be
eligible
for
per
diem
and
actual
and
6


necessary
expenses.
Further,
the
bill
modifies
provisions
7


which
had
previously
stated
that
the
board
shall
consider
and
8


may
incorporate
any
standards
recommended
by
the
appraisal
9


foundation,
or
by
a
professional
appraisal
organization,
or
10


by
a
public
authority
or
organization
responsible
to
review
11


appraisals
or
for
the
oversight
of
appraisers.
This
provision
12


is
modified
to
refer
to
consideration
and
incorporation
of
any
13


standards
required
or
recommended
by
the
appraisal
foundation
14


or
by
a
federal
agency
with
regulatory
authority
over
appraisal
15


standards
or
the
certification
of
appraisers
for
federally
16


related
transactions.
17


The
bill
provides
that
uniform
appraisal
standards
shall,
18


in
addition
to
the
current
requirements,
require
compliance
19


with
the
uniform
standards
of
professional
appraisal
practice
20


in
all
appraisal
assignments.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
21


board
shall
maintain
a
registry
of
the
names
and
certificate
22


numbers,
instead
of
addresses,
of
certified
appraisers
and
23


the
names
and
registration
numbers
of
registered
associate
24


appraisers.
The
bill
deletes
a
provision,
with
reference
25


to
continuing
education
requirements,
that
instructional
26


hours
by
correspondence
and
home
study
courses
claimed
by
an
27


appraiser
shall
not
exceed
50
percent
of
the
required
hours
of
28


instruction
necessary
for
renewal.
29


Again
with
reference
to
real
estate
appraisers,
the
bill
30


adds
provisions
relating
to
criminal
background
checks.
31


The
bill
states
that
the
board
is
authorized
to
require
a
32


national
criminal
history
check
through
the
federal
bureau
33


of
investigation
for
applicants,
certificate
holders,
or
34


registrants
if
needed
to
comply
with
federal

or

or
the

The
bill
states
that
the
board
is
also
2


authorized
to
request
and
obtain
state
criminal
history
data
3


for
applicants,
certificate
holders,
and
registrants.
The
4


bill
specifies
that
a
request
for
criminal
history
data
shall
5


be
submitted
to
the
department
of
public
safety,
division
6


of
criminal
investigation,
pursuant
to
Code
section
692.2,
7


subsection
1.
The
bill
authorizes
the
board,
in
addition
to
8


any
other
fees,
to
charge
and
collect
such
amounts
as
may
9


be
incurred
by
the
board,
the
department
of
public
safety,
10


or
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
in
obtaining
criminal
11


history
information.
The
board
shall
inform
the
applicant,
12


certificate
holder,
or
registrant
of
the
requirement
of
a
13


national
criminal
history
check
or
request
for
criminal

14


data
and
obtain
a
signed
waiver
from
the
applicant,
certificate
15


holder,
or
registrant
prior
to
requesting
the
check
or
data.
16


Additionally,
the
bill
specifies
that
criminal
history
data
and
17


other
criminal
history
information
relating
to
an
applicant,
18


certificate
holder,
or
registrant
obtained
by

is
19


confidential
but
may
be
used
by
the
board
in
a
certificate
or
20


registration
denial
or
disciplinary
proceeding.
21


The
bill
deletes
references
to
a
“written”
or
“oral”
22


examination
in
relation
to
engineering,
land
surveying,
real
23


estate
broker
and
salesperson,
and
real
estate
appraiser
24


licensing
examinations
in
favor
of
the
nonspecific
reference
25


to
“examinations”.
26


Finally,
the
bill
deletes
current
detailed
provisions
27


contained
in
Code
section
544A.21
imposing
requirements
28


relating
to
the

of

the
public
from
misleading
and
deceptive
30


advertising
and
to
guard
against
the
unlicensed

of

The
provisions
are
replaced
with

statement
32


that
