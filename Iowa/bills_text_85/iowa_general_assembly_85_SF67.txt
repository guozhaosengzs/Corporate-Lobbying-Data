applies
can

continue
to

of
the

to
be
used
for
the

of
the
passenger

who
is
the
subject
of
13


the
exemption.
14


This
bill
provides
that
an
exemption
granted
prior
to
July
4,
15


2012,
does
not
expire
when
the
vehicle
to
which
it
applies
is
16


no
longer
used
for
the
transport
of
the
passenger
or
operator
17


who
is
the
subject
of
the
exemption.
The
person
who
is
the
18


subject
of
the
exemption
may
transfer
the
exemption
to
another
19


vehicle
in
which
that
person
is
a
passenger
or
operator.
To
20


accomplish
the
transfer,
the
person
must
obtain
a
form
from
the
21


department,
to
be
signed
by
the
person’s
physician
and
carried
22


in
the
vehicle
at
all
times,
in
the
same
manner
in
which
the
23


original
exemption
was
obtained.
24


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment
and
applies
25


retroactively
to
July
4,
2012.
