3


WHEREAS,
the
Iowa
income
tax
creates
a
substantial
4


financial
burden
on

future;
and
7


WHEREAS,

represents
a
substantial
expense
to
the
9


state
of
Iowa;
and
10


WHEREAS,

of
the
income
tax
could
have
11


a
positive
impact

growth,
without
limiting
the
state’s
ability
to

provide
for
the

security,
and
benefit
of
14


its
citizens;
NOW
