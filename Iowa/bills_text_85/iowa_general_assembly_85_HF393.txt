EXPLANATION
24


This
bill
relates
to
the
judgment
and
sentencing
procedures
25


for
juveniles
who
are
either
excluded
from
juvenile
court
26


jurisdiction
by
operation
of
law
or
who
may
be
waived
to
adult
27


court,
and
to
juvenile
court
intake
officer
access
to
certain
28


records.
The
bill
also
modifies
the
procedures
relating
to
29


placement
of
a
juvenile
on
youthful
offender
status
by
the
30


district
court.
31


Under
the
bill,
when
a
complaint
is
filed
pursuant
to
Code
32


section
232.28
that
a
juvenile
has
committed
a
delinquent
act,
33


the
juvenile
court
intake
officer
making
a
preliminary
inquiry
34


into
the
complaint
shall
be
granted
access
to
report
data
and

disposition
data
for
cases
of
founded
child
abuse
relating
to
1


the
juvenile
who
is
the
subject
of
the
complaint.
“Report
2


data”
and
“disposition
data”
are
defined
in
Code
section
3


235A.13.
4


Current
law
provides
that
if
a
child
who
has
committed
5


a
delinquent
act
is
over
14
years
of
age
and
certain
other
6


circumstances
apply
the
child
may
be
waived
from
juvenile
7


to
district
court
for
prosecution
as
an
adult.
Children
15
8


years
of
age
or
younger
who
commit
certain
felony
offenses
may
9


also
currently
be
waived
to
district
court
for
purposes
of
10


prosecution
as
a
youthful
offender.
11


A
youthful
offender
who
has
been
waived
from
juvenile
court
12


for
purposes
of
prosecution
in
district
court
is,
after
a
13


guilty
plea
or
conviction,
transferred
by
the
district
court
14


for
disposition
and
supervision
by
juvenile
court
until
the
15


age
of
18.
Upon
the
youthful
offender
attaining
the
age
of
16


18,
under
current
law,
the
district
court
is
required
to
hold
17


a
hearing
regarding
the
youthful
offender’s
status
and
has
18


discretion
to
discharge
the
youthful
offender
or
continue
19


supervision
of
the
youthful
offender
in
district
court
as
20


provided
in
Code
section
907.3A.
21


The
bill
redefines
when
a
child
may
be
considered
for
22


youthful
offender
prosecution
and
sentencing.
The
bill
limits
23


use
of
the
option
to
situations
in
which
the
child
is
12
24


through
15
years
of
age
and
has
committed
offenses
which
would
25


be
less
than
a
class
“A”
felony
if
committed
by
an
adult.
For
26


offenses
which
would
be
classified
as
a
class
“A”
felony,
the
27


bill
permits
children
who
are
10
or
11
years
of
age
to
also
be
28


prosecuted
and
sentenced
as
a
youthful
offender.
29


The
bill
standardizes
the
sentencing
options
and
procedures
30


for
a
juvenile
who
is
prosecuted
as
an
adult
either
because
31


the
offense
is
excluded
from
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
or
32


because
the
juvenile
is
waived
to
district
court,
and
for
any
33


juvenile
prosecuted
as
a
youthful
offender
upon
the
youthful
34


offender
attaining
the
age
of
18.
The
bill
provides
that
once
35


-9-

jm/rj

H.F.

a
juvenile
has
been
waived
to
district
court
for
prosecution
1


as
an
adult
and
convicted,
all
subsequent
proceedings
for
any
2


delinquent
act
committed
by
that
juvenile
are
to
be
commenced
3


in
district
court.
The
bill
further
provides
that
if
a
4


juvenile
has
been
waived
to
district
court
for
prosecution
as
5


an
adult
but
is
not
convicted,
subsequent
proceedings
for
any
6


delinquent
act
committed
by
that
juvenile
are
to
be
commenced
7


in
juvenile
court.
The
bill
also
allows
the
district
court
to
8


defer
judgment,
defer
sentence,
suspend
a
sentence
and
place
9


the
juvenile
or
youthful
offender
on
probation
upon
such
terms
10


and
conditions
as
the
court
may
require,
even
if
those
options
11


are
not
available
to
adults
for
the
offense.
Current
law
12


limits
the
sentencing
options
for
certain
offenses
that
are
13


excluded
from
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
and
does
not
allow
14


the
district
court
to
defer
the
sentence
of
a
juvenile
who
has
15


been
waived
to
district
court
pursuant
to
Code
section
232.45
16


for
prosecution
as
an
adult
or
youthful
offender.
17


Under
the
bill
and
in
current
law,
upon
the
youthful
18


offender
attaining
the
age
of
18,
the
district
court
retains
19


the
power
to
defer
the
sentence
and
place
the
youthful
offender
20


on
probation;
sentence
the
youthful
offender
to
a
term
of
21


confinement,
or
terminate
the
order
placing
the
youthful
22


offender
on
youthful
offender
status
and
discharge
the
youthful
23


offender.
24


A
“deferred
judgment”
means
a
sentencing
option
where
the
25


adjudication
of
guilt
and
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
are
26


deferred
by
the
court.
However,
the
court
retains
the
power
27


to
pronounce
judgment
and
impose
sentence
subject
to
the
28


defendant’s
compliance
with
conditions
set
by
the
court
as
a
29


requirement
of
the
deferred
judgment.
30


A
“deferred
sentence”
means
a
sentencing
option
where
the
31


court
enters
an
adjudication
of
guilt
but
does
not
impose
a
32


sentence.
The
court
does
retain
the
power
to
sentence
the
33


defendant
to
any
sentence
it
originally
could
have
imposed
34


subject
to

A

means
a

option
whereby
2


the

pronounces
