EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
relates
to
the
expungement
of
a
dismissal
or
16


acquittal
of
a
criminal
charge.
17


After
a
dismissal
or
acquittal
of
a
criminal
charge,
the
bill
18


requires
the
court’s
criminal
record
relating
to
the
dismissed
19


or
acquitted
charge
to
be
expunged
as
a
matter
of
law.
The
20


bill
specifies
that
the
court
shall
enter
an
order
directing
21


the
clerk
of
the
district
court
to
expunge
the

criminal
22


record.
23


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
the
dismissal
or
acquittal
24


of
a
criminal
charge
if
a
deferred
judgment
was
entered
25


for
a
charge
related
to
the
dismissed
or
acquitted
charge
26


because
expungement
provisions
are
already
in
place
for
this
27


circumstance
in
Code
section

The
