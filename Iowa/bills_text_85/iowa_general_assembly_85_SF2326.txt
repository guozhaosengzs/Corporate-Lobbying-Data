EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
tax
4


credit
pilot
project,
which
is
a
program
that
allows
pilot
5


project
cities
to
enter
into
withholding
agreements
with
6


businesses
that
meet
certain
job
creation,
capital
investment,
7


and
private
financial
support
requirements
within
the
city.
8


Withholding
agreements
provide
for
the
diversion
of
a
certain
9


percentage
of
the
gross
wages
paid
by
the
business
to
the
pilot
10


project
city
for
a
project
related
to
the
employer
pursuant
to
11


the
agreement.
12


Under
current
law,
the
program
is
restricted
to
four
pilot
13


project
cities;
one
in
a
county
bordering
Nebraska,
one
in
a
14


county
bordering
South
Dakota,
and
two
in
counties
bordering
15


states
other
than
Nebraska
or
South
Dakota.
However,
a
county
16


with
a
population
of
less
than
45,000
residents
may
count
17


two
cities
as
one
pilot
project
city.
The
current
pilot
18


project
cities
are
Sioux
City,
Fort
Madison,
Council
Bluffs,
19


Burlington,
and
Keokuk.

bill
amends

more
census

wholly
contain

more
census
tracts.
23

border
Illinois

be
designated
