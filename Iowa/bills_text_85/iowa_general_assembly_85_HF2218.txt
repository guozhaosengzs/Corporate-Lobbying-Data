——
ELECTRONIC
POSTING
AND
TRANSMISSION
OF
16


INSURANCE
NOTICES
AND
DOCUMENTS.
New
Code
chapter
505B
17


regulates
the
electronic
delivery
and
posting
on
an
electronic
18


network,
of
certain
insurance
notices
and
documents
required
to
19


be
sent
to
a
person
including
but
not
limited
to
an
applicant,
20


an
insured,
a
policyholder,
or
an
annuity
contract
holder
as
21


part
of
an
insurance
transaction.
22


New
Code
section
505B.1
provides
that
any
such
notice
or
23


document
required
to
be
sent
to
such
a
person
under
applicable
24


law
may
be
delivered,
stored,
or
presented
by
electronic
means
25


so
long
as
the
notice
or
document
meets
the
requirements
of
26


the
Uniform
Electronic
Transactions
Act
(Code
chapter
554D)
27


and
the
requirements
of
this
new
Code
section.
Electronic
28


delivery
that
meets
these
requirements
is
considered
equivalent
29


to
delivery
under
other
methods
required
by
law
such
as
first
30


class
mail,
certified
mail,
or
certificate
of
mail.
31


In
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
new
Code
section
505B.1,
32


the
recipient
must
affirmatively
consent
to
electronic
delivery
33


or
posting
and
must
be
provided
with
a
clear
and
conspicuous
34


statement
informing
the
recipient
of
their
rights,
including
35


-10-

H.F.

the
right
to
withdraw
consent
and
any
fees
imposed
for
doing
1


so.
The
recipient
must
also
be
provided
with
the
hardware
and
2


software
requirements
for
accessing
information
in
electronic
3


form
and
notified
if
those
requirements
change.
4


New
Code
section
505B.1
does
not
affect
legal
requirements
5


related
to
the
content
or
timing
of
any
notice
or
document.
6


If
the
legal
requirements
expressly
require
verification
or
7


acknowledgment
of
receipt
of
the
notice
or
document,
the
8


electronic
delivery
must
provide
for
such
verification
or
9


acknowledgment
of
receipt.
The
legal
effectiveness,
validity,
10


or
enforceability
of
any
contract
or
policy
of
insurance
cannot
11


be
denied
solely
because
of
the
failure
to
obtain
electronic
12


consent
or
confirmation
of
the
consent
pursuant
to
the
new
13


Code
section.
A
withdrawal
of
consent
does
not
affect
the
14


legal
effectiveness,
validity,
or
enforceability
of
a
notice
or
15


document
delivered
by
electronic
means
prior
to
the
effective
16


date
of
the
withdrawal
of
consent.
17


If
a
party
had
consented
to
receive
certain
notices
or
18


documents
electronically
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
new
19


Code
chapter
505B,
an
insurer
who
intends
to
deliver
additional
20


notices
or
documents
to
the
party
pursuant
to
the
new
Code
21


chapter
must
provide
notice
of
that
fact
and
inform
the
party
22


of
the
right
to
withdraw
consent
to
such
delivery.
23


Except
as
otherwise
prohibited
by
law,
if
an
oral
24


communication
or
recording
of
an
oral
communication
from
a
25


party
can
be
reliably
stored
and
reproduced
by
an
insurer,
the
26


oral
communication
or
recording
may
qualify
as
a
notice
or
27


document
delivered
by
electronic
means.
Also,
the
electronic
28


signature
of
a
person
is
satisfactory
to
meet
requirements
to
29


notarize,
acknowledge,
verify,
or
make
under
oath
a
signature,
30


notice,
or
document.
31


New
Code
section
505B.1
shall
not
be
construed
to
modify,
32


limit,
or
supersede
the
provisions
of
the
federal
Electronic

National
Commerce
Act.
