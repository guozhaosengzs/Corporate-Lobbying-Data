a

a

of
transportation.
In

the
bill
authorizes
the

2


initiative
or
at
the
request
of
any
other
authority
having
3


control
over
highways
or
traffic.
4


Current
law
requires
any
driver
who
is
involved
in
an
5


accident
resulting
only
in
damage
to
a
vehicle
to
immediately
6


stop
at
the
scene
and
remain
there
until
the
driver
has
7


exchanged
pertinent
information
with
the
person
attending
the
8


other
vehicle
involved
in
the
accident,
or

safely.
The
14


removal
is
to
be
done
