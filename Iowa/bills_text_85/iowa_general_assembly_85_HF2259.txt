EXPLANATION
6


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
7


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
8


This
bill
relates
to
the
Iowa
Indian
child
welfare
Act
(Iowa
9


ICWA)
by
amending
provisions
found
to
be
unconstitutional
by
10


Iowa
courts
and
making
other
changes.
11


Under
Code
section
232B.2,
the
purpose
of
the
Iowa
ICWA
is
to
12


clarify
state
policies
and
procedures
regarding
implementation
13


of
the
federal
Indian
Child
Welfare
Act
(federal
ICWA),
enacted
14


in
1978.
15


The
bill
changes
the
definition
of
“Indian”
and
“Indian
16


child”.
The
bill
eliminates
language
defining
“Indian
child”
17


as
a
child
who
is
under
18
years
of
age
that
an
Indian
tribe
18


identifies
as
a
child
of
the
tribe’s
community.
The
bill
19


provides
that
an
“Indian
child”
is
a
person
under
18
years
of
20


age
that
is
either
a
member
of
an
Indian
tribe,
or
is
eligible
21


for
membership
and
is
the
biological
child
of
a
member
of
an
22


Indian
tribe.
In
the
Iowa
supreme
court
case,
In
re
A.W.
and
23


S.W.,
741
N.W.2d
793
(Iowa
2007),
the
court
found
that
the
24


language
eliminated
by
the
bill
expanded
the
scope
of
the
Iowa
25


ICWA
beyond
the
group
of
children
addressed
by
the
federal
26


ICWA,
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
United
27


States
Constitution
and
the
equality
provision
of
article
I,
28


section
6,
of
the
Iowa
Constitution.
The
bill
eliminates
29


language
defining
“Indian”
as
a
person
who
is
eligible
for
30


membership
in
an
Indian
tribe.
The
definitions
of
“Indian”
31


and
“Indian
child”
provided
in
the
bill
reflect
the
federal
32


language.
33


The
bill
adds
circumstances
that
qualify
as
good
cause
34


for
a
district
court
to
deny
a
petition
to
transfer
Indian

child
custody
proceedings
to
a
tribe.
The
bill
also
adds
1


language
that
a
district
court
can
deny
a
petition
to
transfer
2


Indian
child
custody
proceedings
to
a
tribe
for
good
cause.
3


Circumstances
qualifying
as
good
cause
pursuant
to
the
bill
4


include
that
the
proceeding
was
at
an
advanced
stage
and
5


the
petitioner
did
not
file
a
timely
petition
to
transfer
6


jurisdiction,
the
objection
of
an
Indian
child
over
the
age
7


of
12
to
the
transfer,
and
that
the
transfer
is
not
in
the
8


best
interest
of
the
Indian
child.
The
Iowa
court
of
appeals
9


ruled
in
In
re
J.L.,
779
N.W.2d
481
(Iowa
Ct.
App.
2009),
10


that
the
exclusion
of
the
child’s
right
to
object
to
the
11


transfer
and
the
exclusion
of
the
child’s
right
to
object
to
12


the
transfer
based
on
the
child’s
best
interests
from
the
list
13


of
circumstances
constituting
good
cause
to
deny
transfer
14


of
custody
proceedings
violated
the
child’s
substantive
due
15


process
rights.
In
In
re
J.W.,
528
N.W.2d
657
(Iowa
Ct.
App.
16


1995),
the
court
of
appeals
also
affirmed
the
denial
of
a
17


petition
to
transfer
jurisdiction
when
the
proceeding
was
at
an
18


advanced
stage
and
the
petitioner
did
not
file
the
petition
in
19


a
timely
manner
after
receiving
notice
of
the
hearing.
20


The
bill
also
amends
provisions
in
Code
section
232B.9
21


relating
to
preferences
for
adoption
and
other
permanent
22


placement,
emergency
removal,
foster
care,
or
preadoptive
23


placement
of
an
Indian
child
to
allow
a
good
cause
exception
24


to
the
specified
placement
preferences.
The
bill
eliminates
25


language
that
provides
that
consideration
of
the
preference
26


of
the
Indian
child
or
the
parent
or
parent’s
request
for
27


anonymity
cannot
be
used
as
the
basis
for
deviating
from
28


the
order
of
placement
otherwise
specified
in
the
Iowa
ICWA
29


unless
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
using
the
30


order
of
placement
would
be
harmful
to
the
Indian
child.
The
31


Iowa
supreme
court
ruled
in
In
re
N.N.E.,
752
N.W.2d
1
(Iowa
32


2008),
that
the
federal
ICWA
allows
the
court
to
deviate
33


for
good
cause
from
placement
preferences
and
that
the
high
34


burden
in
the
Iowa
ICWA
to
deviate
from
placement
preferences

H.F.

for
good
cause
violates
a
parent’s
substantive
due
process
1


rights.
Although
the
facts
addressed
in
the
ruling
applied
to
2


a
voluntary
termination
of
parental
rights,
the
court
noted
3


that
the
placement
preferences
in
the
Iowa
ICWA
also
apply
to
4


emergency
removal,
foster
care,
and
preadoptive
placements.
5


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
for
expert
testimony
at
6


an
adoption
hearing
for
an
Indian
child.
