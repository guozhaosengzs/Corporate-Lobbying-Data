The
inclusion
of
this

does
not
constitute
agreement
with

the
explanation’s
substance
by

members
of

21


This
bill
relates
to
the
approval
and
imposition
of
local
22


option
taxes.
Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
23


imposition
of
local
option
taxes,
including
a
local
option
24


sales
and
services
tax.
Currently,
such
a
proposed
tax
is
25


only
presented
to
the
voters
of
a
whole
county
upon
the
filing
26


of
a
petition
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
county
equal
27


in
number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
the
county
who
voted
28


at
the
last
preceding
general
election
or
upon
receipt
by
the
29


county
commissioner
of
elections
of
motions
requesting
such
30


submission,
adopted
by
the
governing
bodies
of
the
cities
31


located
within
the
county
or
the
governing
body
of
the
county
32


for
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
representing
at
33


least
one-half
of
the
population
of
the
county.
34


The
bill
amends
the
methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
the

local
option
sales
and
services
tax
to
the
voters
of
certain
1


qualified
counties
by
allowing
the
eligible
electors
of
2


individual
cities
and
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
to
3


file
a
petition
for
an
election
to
be
held
in
the
petitioning
4


jurisdiction
if
such
petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
5


of
the
city
or
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
6


applicable,
equal
in
number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
7


the
applicable
city
or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
8


voted
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
The
bill
defines
9


“qualified
county”
to
mean
a
county
with
a
population
in
10


excess
of
400,000
or
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
least
11


60,000
but
not
more
than
70,000,
according
to
the
2010
federal
12


decennial
census.
For
those
qualified
counties,
the
bill
also
13


removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
the
local
sales
14


and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
motions
must
be
15


approved
by
cities
or
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area,
16


representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
county’s
population.
17


Instead,
the
bill
allows
individual
cities
or
the
county
for
18


the
unincorporated
area
within
a
qualified
county
to
approve
a
19


motion
for
an
election
on
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
to
20


be
held
in
only
that
jurisdiction.
21


The
bill
provides
that
in
a
qualified
county
a
city
or
the
22


board
of
supervisors
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
23


may
repeal
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
the
city
upon
24


adoption
of
its
own
motion
for
repeal.
25


For
those
counties
that
are
not
qualified
counties,
the
26


methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
the
local
option
sales
and
27


services
tax
to
the
voters
and
the
methods
for
repealing
such
28


a
tax
remain
the
same
as
required
under
current
Code
chapter
29


423B.
30


The
bill
strikes
special
provisions
related
to
the
approval
31


and
imposition
of
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
a
city
that
32


is
located
in
two
or
more
contiguous
counties.
33


The
bill
provides
that
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
is
34


not
applicable
to
transactions
of
a
retailer
holding
a

is
located

part
within
a
city
or
unincorporated
2


area
of
the
county
where
the

is
not

3


Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
imposition
of
a
4


local
sales
and
services
tax
at
a
rate
of
not
more
than
1
5


percent.
The
bill
requires
a
local
sales
and
services
tax,
if
6


imposed,
to
be
1
percent.
7


The
bill
provides
that
the
imposition
of
local
option
8


taxes
in
effect
on
the
effective
date
of
this
Act
shall
not
9


be
affected
by
the
bill
and
such
taxes
shall
continue
to
be
10


imposed
until
their
repeal
pursuant

law
in

at
the
time
of
the
repeal
governs
the
repeal
of
12


the
local
option
taxes.
