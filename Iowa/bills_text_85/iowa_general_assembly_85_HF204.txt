to

and
no

shall

24


EXPLANATION
25


This
bill
relates
to
compulsory
education
standards,
26


penalties,
and
dropout
prevention
efforts.
27


The
bill
raises
the
compulsory
school
attendance
age
from
16
28


to
18.
Each
school
district
must
make
every
effort
to
prevent
29


students
from
dropping
out
of
school,
and
is
directed
to
align
30


and
maximize
all
of
the
funding
streams
that
may
be
used
to
31


support
students
who
are
at
risk
of
dropping
out
of
school.
32


The
department
of
transportation
is
directed
to
reinstate,
33


upon
receipt
of
proof
of
high
school
graduation
from
a
person
34


whose
intermediate
or
full
driver’s
license
was
suspended
or

revoked
because
the
person
was
truant,
the
person’s
license
for
1


a
fee
of
$25,
notwithstanding
a
current
Code
provision
that
2


permits
the
department
to
charge
a
fee
of
$20
for
reinstatement
3


of
a
license.
The
bill
makes
a
technical
change
to
specify
4


that
the
current
Code
provision
which
prohibits
licensure
for
5


failure
to
attend
school
or
classes
applies
only
to
persons
who
6


are
not
exempt
from
the
provision
establishing
the
compulsory
7


attendance
age.
8


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
9


section
25B.3.
The
bill
requires
that
the
state
cost
of
10


any
state
mandate
included
in
the
bill
be
paid
by
a
school
11


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
12


school
district
under
section
257.16.
The
specification
is
13


deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
14


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
15


inclusion
of
this
specification
is
intended
to
reinstate
the
16


requirement
of
political
subdivisions
to
comply
with
any
state
17


mandates
included
in
the
bill.
