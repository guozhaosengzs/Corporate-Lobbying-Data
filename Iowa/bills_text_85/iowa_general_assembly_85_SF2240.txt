,


the

in
anticipation
of
the


collection
of
the
tax
with
a
bank,
investment
banker,
trust


company,
insurance
company,
or
insurance
group.


b.


By
resolution,
the
board
shall
provide
for
an
annual
levy


which
is
within
the
limits
of
the
voter-approved
physical
plant


and
equipment
levy
to
pay
for
the
amount
of
the
principal
and


interest
due
each
year
until
maturity.
The
board
shall
file


a
certified
copy
of
the
resolution
with
the
auditor
of
each


county
in
which
the
district
is
located.
The
filing
of
the


resolution
with
the
auditor
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
auditor


to
annually
levy
the
amount
certified
for
collection
until


funds
are
realized
to
repay
the
loan
and
interest
on
the
loan


in
full.


c.


The
loan
must
mature
within
the
period
of
time
authorized


by
the
voters
and
shall
bear
interest
at
a
rate
which
does
not


exceed
the
limits
under
chapter
74A
.
A
loan
agreement
entered


into
pursuant
to
this
section
shall
be
in
a
form
as
the
board


of
directors
shall
by
resolution
provide
and
the
loan
shall
be


payable
as
to
both
principal
and
interest
from
the
proceeds


of
the
annual
levy
of
the
voter-approved
physical
plant
and


equipment
levy,
or
so
much
thereof
as
will
be
sufficient
to
pay


the
loan
and
interest
on
the
loan.


d.


The
proceeds
of
a
loan
must
be
deposited
in
the
physical


plant
and
equipment
levy
fund.
Warrants
paid
from
this
fund


must
be
for
purposes
authorized
for
the
voter-approved
physical


plant
and
equipment
levy.


2.
This
section
does
not
limit
the
authority
of
the
board


of
directors
to
levy
the
full
amount
of
the
voter-approved


physical
plant
and
equipment
levy,
but
if
and
to
whatever


extent
the
tax
is
levied
in
any
year
in
excess
of
the
amount


of
principal
and
interest
falling
due
in
that
year
under
a


loan
agreement,
the
first
available
proceeds,
to
an
amount


sufficient
to
meet
maturing
installments
of
principal
and


interest
under
the
loan
agreement,
shall
be
paid
into
the


debt
service
fund
for
the
loan
before
the
taxes
are
otherwise


made
available
to
the
school
corporation
for
other
school


purposes,
and
the
amount
required
to
be
annually
set
aside
to










Senate
File

p.
35


pay
principal
of
and
interest
on
the
money
borrowed
under
the


loan
agreement
constitutes
a
first
charge
upon
the
proceeds
of


the
voter-approved
physical
plant
and
equipment
levy,
which
tax


shall
be
pledged
to
pay
the
loan
and
the
interest
on
the
loan.


3.
This
section
is
supplemental
and
in
addition
to
existing


statutory
authority
to
finance
the
purposes
specified
in


section
298.2
for
the
physical
plant
and
equipment
levy,
and


for
the
borrowing
of
money
and
execution
of
loan
agreements
in


connection
with
that
section,
and
is
not
subject
to
any
other


law.
The
fact
that
a
school
corporation
may
have
previously


borrowed
money
and
entered
into
loan
agreements
under
authority


of
this
section
does
not
prevent
the
school
corporation
from


borrowing
additional
money
and
entering
into
further
loan


agreements
if
the
aggregate
of
the
amount
payable
under
all


of
the
loan
agreements
does
not
exceed
the
proceeds
of
the


voter-approved
physical
plant
and
equipment
levy.

(1)
Nonbusiness
interest,
dividends,
rents
and


royalties,

manner

each
of
which
may
still
derive
some
separate
benefits
from
the


separated
portions
of
the
district.


2.


If
the
public
improvement
is
such
as
to
leave
two


separate
portions

that
are
still
operable


and
of
benefit
to
the
land
on
each
side
of
the
division
made
by

may
divide
the
district


into
two
separate
units
so
that
each
may
perform
further
work


on
the
improvements
in
their
respective
parts,
but
neither


shall
be
charged
for
work
completed
on
the
opposite
side
of


the
new
improvement
that
divides
them
and
may
only
be
charged


for
the
work
done
in
that
portion
of
the
district
remaining
on


their
side
of
the
division.


3.


The
same
authority
provided

vest
in

event

manner
relinquishes

may
be
removed

may
be
divided

further
in
dividing
the
district
award
to


each
of
the
separated
portions

the
improvement


remaining
in
each
portion,
determine
the
value
of
the


improvement
so
remaining
on
each
side
and
secondly
determine


the
contributions
of
the
lands
in
the
separated
portions
to
the


improvements
and
the
upkeep
of
the
earlier
district,
and
if


the
contribution
is
proportionate
neither
side
shall
owe
the


other
portion
of
the
district
any
money,
but
if
contribution


is
disproportionate,
the
board
shall
determine
an
equitable


adjustment
and
the
amount
of
payment
required
for
one
portion


to
pay
to
the
other
to
buy
the
existing
improvement.


5.
If
land
is
eliminated
from
any
further
benefits,
there


need
not
be
any
reclassification
and
the
board
may
remove
the


same
from
the
district
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
land
has


been
destroyed
in
whole
by
the
erosion
of
