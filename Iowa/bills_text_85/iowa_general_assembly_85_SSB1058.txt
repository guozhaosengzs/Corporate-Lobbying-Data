FRAMEWORK
AND
TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE.
Though
school
districts
20


have
until
July
1,
2016,
to
implement
approved
frameworks
21


or
comparable
systems
of
career
paths
and
compensation
that
22


contain
differentiated
multiple
leadership
roles,
school
23


districts
may,
prior
to
that
date,
apply
to
the
department
24


for
early
implementation
of
the
framework
or
a
comparable
25


system.
The
department
is
directed
to
establish
criteria
26


and
a
process
for
application
and
approval
of
the
framework
27


and
comparable
systems.
The
bill
appropriates
$500,000
from
28


the
general
fund
of
the
state
annually
to
the
department
to
29


provide
technical
assistance
with
not
more
than
two
full-time
30


equivalent
positions
to
school
districts
and
AEAs
in
the
design
31


and
implementation
of
the
framework.
In
distributing
and
32


expending
these
moneys,
the
department
must
give
priority
to
33


school
districts
with
enrollments
of
fewer
than
600
students.
34


A
teacher
employed
by
an
AEA
may

The

the
awarding
of

11


FRAMEWORK
DESIGN.
The
framework
is
designed
to
attract
able
12

new
teachers
by
offering
competitive
starting
13


salaries
and
offering
short-term
and
long-term

opportunities,
retain
effective

by
providing
enhanced
career
opportunities,
promote
16


collaboration
by
developing
and
supporting
opportunities
for
17


teachers
in
schools
and
school
districts
statewide
to
learn
18


from
each
other,
reward
professional
growth
and
effective
19

by
providing
pathways
for

that
20


involve
increased

is
at

27


which

An
