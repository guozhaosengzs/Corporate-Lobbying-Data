EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
concerns
county
supervisor
districting
plans.
3


Under
current
law,
following
adoption
by
the
county
4


supervisors
of
a
county
supervisor
districting
plan,
an
5


eligible
elector
from
the
county
may
file,
within
14
days
of
6


adopting
the
plan,
a
complaint
with
the
state
commissioner
of
7


elections
(the
secretary
of
state),
alleging
that
the
plan
was
8


drawn
for
improper
political
reasons.
Once
filed,
current
law
9


provides
that
the
complaint
be
forwarded
to
the
ethics
and
10


campaign
disclosure
board
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
11


plan
was
improperly
drawn.
12


The
bill
eliminates
the
complaint
process
relative
to
13


the
ethics
and
campaign
disclosure
board.
Instead,
the
bill
14


provides
that
if
following
the
adoption
of
a
county
supervisor
15


district
plan
a
valid
petition
is
filed
with
the
state
16


commissioner
of
elections,
the
state
commissioner
shall
reject
17


the
plan
and
request
the
legislative
council
to
direct
the
18


legislative
services
agency
to
draw
a
plan.
The
bill
provides
19


that
the
petition
shall
be
filed
within
30
days
after
the
20


adoption
of
the
plan
and
shall
be
signed
by
eligible
electors
21


of
the
county
equal
in
number
to
at
least
2
percent
of
the
total
22


votes
cast
for
the
office
of
governor
in
the
county
at
the
23


last
preceding
general
election
for
governor.
To
be
counted,
24


a
signature
shall
not
be
dated
prior
to
the
date
the
board
of
25


supervisors
approved
the
plan.
26


The
bill
provides
that
once
the
state
commissioner
27


determines
that
a
valid
petition
has
been
filed
and
has
made
a
28


request
to
the
legislative
council,
the
legislative
services
29


agency
shall
draw
a
proposed
county
supervisor
districting
30


plan
and
submit
the
plan
to
the
county
board
of
supervisors
31


who
shall
approve
or
reject
the
plan
within
thirty
days.
If
32


the
plan
is
rejected,
the
bill
provides
that
the
county
shall
33


provide
reasons
for
the
rejection
to
the
state
commissioner
34


of
elections
and
the
state
commissioner
shall
