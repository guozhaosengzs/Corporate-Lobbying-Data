Section
1.
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
1


business
ownership
by
women
is
essential
to
the
economic
2


growth
and
vitality
of
Iowa,
but
that
women
in
Iowa
continue
3


to
experience
barriers
to
entry
into
business
ownership.
4


The
general
assembly
recognizes
that
the
existence
of
these
5


barriers
has
resulted
in
a
very
low
rate,
in
number
and
growth,
6


of
women-owned
businesses
in
Iowa
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
7


nation.
Therefore,
it
is
the
intent
and
goal
of
the
general
8


assembly
to
encourage
and
increase
business
ownership
by
9


women
in
Iowa
and
to
reduce
the
gender
disparity
in
business
10


ownership
in
Iowa
and,
to
that
end,
the
general
assembly
11


finds
that
lowering
financial
barriers
by
creating
the
Iowa
12


woman-owned
business
tax
credit
is
an
appropriate
means
to
13


accomplish
this
goal.

“Eligible

is
defined
as
a
woman

is
a
resident
4


of
this
state.
However,
for

an
eligible
person,
equity
interests
sold
to
or
6


owned
by
a

joint

venture,
association,

11


“Iowa

Several

a
taxpayer
16


is
eligible
for
the
credit.
First,
the
sale
must

upon

least
51

the

21


must
retain
ownership
of
the
equity

for

12
22


consecutive
months
following
the

must
23


provide
a
written
statement
to
the
department
of
revenue
and
24


the
taxpayer
certifying
that
the
ownership
requirement
was
25


met.
An
eligible
person
who
willfully
makes
a
false
statement
26


is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
27


punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
28


at

29


A
taxpayer
shall
not
claim
the

Any

excess
of
31


the
taxpayer’s
tax
liability
may
be
carried
forward
for
seven
32


years
or
until
depleted,
whichever
occurs
earlier.
33


A

tax
credit
must
be
repaid
by
a
34


taxpayer
under
two

that

calculated
using
an
equity
interest
that
is
later
1


reacquired
by
the
taxpayer
must
be
repaid
to
the
extent
the
2


credit
was
calculated
using
that
reacquired
equity
interest.
3


Second,
if
any
amount
of
credit
was
calculated
using
an
amount
4


of

that

represented
by
a
promissory
note,
5


loan,
or
other
form
of
indebtedness
owed
to
the
taxpayer,
and
6


the
taxpayer
later
discharges
or
forgives
all
or
a
portion
7


of
that
indebtedness,
the
credit
shall
be
repaid
unless
the
8


discharge
of
indebtedness
was
excludable
from
gross
income
9


under
section
108
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code,
which,
for
10


purposes
of
this
credit,
generally
covers
situations
where
11


the
debtor
is
in
bankruptcy
or
is
otherwise
insolvent.
The
12


department
of
revenue
is
permitted
to
treat
the
failure
to
make
13


a
repayment
of
a
credit
in
the
same
manner
as
a
failure
to
pay
a
14


tax
due
on
a
return
or
deposit
form.
15


An
individual
may
claim
the
tax
credit
allowed
a
16


partnership,
LLC,
S
corporation,
estate,
or
trust
electing
17


to
have
the
income
taxed
directly
to
the
individual,
based
18


upon
the
pro

share
of
the
individual’s
earnings
of
the
19


applicable
entity.
20


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2015,
and
applies
to
tax
21


years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date,
and
to
sales
of
equity
22


interests
in
Iowa
businesses
occurring
on
or
after
that
date.
