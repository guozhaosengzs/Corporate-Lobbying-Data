treasurer’s
offices
that
12


are
authorized
to
issue
driver’s
licenses
and
nonoperator’s
13


identification
cards
in
Iowa.
The
county
treasurers
retain
14


for
deposit
in
the
county
general
fund
$7
of
the
fee
from
each
15


driver’s
license
or
nonoperator’s

19


Moneys

retained
by
23


the
county
treasurers
from
fees.
The
reimbursement
is
to
24


occur
annually,
on
or

1,

moneys
available
in
25


the
driver’s
license
reimbursement
fund
on

28


cost
per
card
issued
by
all
county
treasurer’s
offices,
as
29


stated
in
the
most
recent
report
on

license
issuance

compiled
by

auditor
of
state,
and

remainder
31


by

number
of

licenses
and
nonoperator’s
32


identification
cards
issued
by
the
county
treasurer’s
office
33


during
the
preceding
fiscal
year.

reimbursement
fund

of

roads
and
