EXPLANATION
1


GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
the
distribution
and
sale
of
2


motor
fuel
by
terminals,
suppliers,
distributors,
and
retail
3


dealers.
Motor
fuel
(e.g.,
gasoline)
and
special
fuel
(e.g.,
4


diesel
fuel)
move
into
this
state
via
a
pipeline
or
marine
5


vessel
to
a
terminal
where
in
turn
the
fuel
is
withdrawn
by
a
6


supplier
and
then
purchased
and
transported
by
a
distributor
7


and
ultimately
a
dealer
who
sells
the
fuel
at
retail.

LIABILITY
PROTECTION.
In
2011,
the
general
assembly
9


enacted
SF
531,
which
provided
that
a
retail
dealer
is
not
10


liable
for
damages
caused
by
the
use
of
incompatible
motor
11


fuel
dispensed
at
the
retail
dealer’s
motor
fuel
site
under
12


certain
conditions.
The
incompatible
motor
fuel
must
comply
13


with
the
specifications
for
that
type
of
motor
fuel,
it
must
14


be
selected
by
a
person
other
than
the
retail
dealer,
and
it
15


must
be
dispensed
from
a
motor
fuel
pump
that
correctly
labels
16


the
type
of
fuel
dispensed
(Code
section
214A.20).
This
bill
17


extends
such
protection
against
liability
