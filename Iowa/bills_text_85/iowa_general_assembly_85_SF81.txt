Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
of
1


the
state
of
Iowa
finds
that:
2


1.
The
people
of
the
several
states
comprising
the
United
3


States
of
America
created
the
federal
government
to
be
their
4


agent
for
certain
enumerated
purposes,
and
nothing
more.
5


2.
The
Tenth
Amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
the
United
6


States
defines
the
total
scope
of
federal
powers
as
being
that
7


which
has
been
delegated
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
8


to
the
federal
government,
and
all
powers
not
delegated
to
the
9


federal
government
in
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
10


are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively,
or
to
the
people
11


themselves.
12


3.
The
assumption
of
power
that
the
federal
government
has
13


made
by
enacting
the
federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
14


Care
Act
interferes
with
the
right
of
the
people
of
the
state
15


of
Iowa
to
regulate
health
care
as
they
see
fit,
and
makes
a
16


mockery
of
James
Madison’s
assurance
in
Federalist
Number
45
17


that
the
powers
delegated
to
the
federal
government
are
few
and
18


defined,
while
those
of
the
states
are
numerous
and
indefinite.

23
