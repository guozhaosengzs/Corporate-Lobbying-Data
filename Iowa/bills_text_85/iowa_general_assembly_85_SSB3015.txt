skipping
transfer
tax
and
Iowa
estate
tax.
Iowa
once
had
an
1


estate
tax
equal
to
the
federal
estate
tax
credit
for
state
2


inheritance
and
estate
taxes
paid.
This
type
of
tax
was
3


referred
to
as
a
“pick-up
tax”
because
it
levied
an
amount
4


of
tax
equal
to
the
credit
against
federal
estate
taxes,
5


thereby
allowing
the
state
to
collect
estate
tax
revenue
6


without
increasing
the
total
amount
of
tax
due
from
the
estate.
7


Similarly,
Iowa
has
a
generation
skipping
transfer
tax
based
on
8


the
same
concept
and
equal
to
the
federal
generation
skipping
9


transfer
tax
credit
for
state
generation
skipping
transfer
tax
10


paid.
11


In
2001,
Congress
enacted
the
Economic
Growth
and
Tax
Relief
12


Reconciliation
Act
which
temporarily
phased
out
these
two
13


federal
tax
credits
and
replaced
them
with
reduced
federal
14


estate
tax
rates
and
an
increased
exemption
level
for
estates.
15


These
federal
tax
credits
were
fully
phased
out
in
2005.
16


Therefore,
Iowa
has
not
collected
any
estate
tax
or
generation
17


skipping
transfer
tax
for
estates
of
decedents
dying,
nor
for
18


generation
skipping
transfers
occurring,
after
December
31,
19


2004.
20


Iowa’s
estate
tax
was
repealed
in
2008
and
then
reenacted
21


in
2010,
but
its
implementation
was
contingent
on
the
22


reimplementation
of
the
federal
tax
credits.
However,
in
23


2013
Congress
enacted
the
American
Taxpayer
Relief
Act
which
24


permanently
eliminated
the
federal
estate
tax
and
generation
25


skipping
transfer
tax
credits.
26


The
division
also
makes
conforming
changes
to
remove
27


references
in
the
Iowa
Code
to
the
Iowa
estate
tax
and
to
Code
28


chapters
450A
and
451.
