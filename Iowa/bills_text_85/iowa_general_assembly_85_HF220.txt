EXPLANATION
14


Under
current
law,
when
a
peace
officer
stops
a
motor
15


vehicle
and
the
driver
is
unable
to
provide
proof
of
financial
16


liability
coverage
for
the
vehicle,
the
peace
officer
17


may
issue
a
warning
or
a
citation
to
the
driver;
issue
a
18


citation
and
remove
the
motor
vehicle’s
license
plates
and
19


registration
receipt;
or
issue
a
citation,
remove
the
plates
20


and
registration
receipt,
and
impound
the
motor
vehicle.
If
21


the
person
receives
a
citation
and
then
produces
to
the
clerk
22


of
court
prior
to
the
date
of
the
person’s
court
appearance
23


proof
that
financial
liability
coverage
was
in
effect
for
the
24


motor
vehicle
at
the
time
the
person
was
stopped
and
cited,
the
25


court
is
required
to
dismiss
the
citation,
but
the
costs
of
the
26


action
are
assessed
against
the
defendant.
In
addition,
if
the
27


peace
officer
who
issued
the
citation
removed
the
vehicle’s
28


license
plates
and
registration
receipt
or
ordered
the
vehicle
29


impounded,
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
is
required
to
pay
a
30


$15
administrative
fee
to
the
county
treasurer
to
obtain
new
31


license
plates
and
registration.
If
the
vehicle
was
impounded,
32


the
cost
of
towing
and
storage
must
also
be
paid.
This
bill
33


strikes
the
requirement
that
court
costs
be
assessed
against
a
34


defendant
whose
citation
is
dismissed
and
the
requirement
that

the
citation
is
dismissed.
