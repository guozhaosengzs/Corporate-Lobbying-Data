EXPLANATION
2


BACKGROUND.
In
1996,
the
general
assembly
enacted
SF
3


2449
(1996
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1197)
which
in
part
provided
4


a
livestock
production
tax
credit
not
to
exceed
$3,000
per
5


operation
in
total
for
a
tax
year.
The
tax
credit
was
made
6


available
to
an
individual
or
corporate
taxpayer
and
was
7


computed
by
multiplying
10
cents
times
the
amount
of
corn
or
8


corn
equivalents
consumed
by
the
livestock
in
the
production
9


operation.
For
example
the
corn
equivalency
for
cow-calf
10


operations
(mature
beef
cattle
bred
or
for
breeding,
bred
11


yearling
heifers,
and
breeding
bulls)
equaled
111.5
(10
cents
12


x
111.5
=
$11.15).
The
Act
also
included
a
standing
limited
13


annual
appropriation
of
$2
million
to
support
the
tax
credit.
14


The
tax
credit
was
not
used
to
directly
reduce
the
taxpayer’s
15


income
tax
liability
but
instead
was
used
to
calculate
the
16


amount
of
a
refund
paid
to
the
taxpayer
who
filed
a
refund
17


claim
with
the
department
of
revenue.
The
Act
also
included
18


procedures
for
use
by
the
department
to
prorate
refund
claim
19


amounts
in
case
the
annual
appropriation
was
not
sufficient
20


to
satisfy
all
claims.
In
addition,
the
Act
provided
that
21


it
would
be
used
only
to
support
cow-calf
operations
for
the
22


current
tax
year.
In
1997,
the
general
assembly
enacted
HF
23


726
(1997
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
206),
which
provided
that
the
24


tax
credit
would
only
apply
to
such
operations.
In
addition
25


the
Act
replaced
a
maximum
threshold
net
worth
requirement
26


for
tax
filers
with
a
federally
taxable
income
threshold
27


equaling
$99,600
for
tax
year
beginning
January
1,
1997,
and
28


automatically
adjusted
each
year
for
inflation.
In
2009,
the
29


general
assembly
enacted
SF
478
repealing
the
tax
credit
(2009
30


Iowa
Acts,
chapter
179).
31


BILL
——
RESTORATION
OF
THE
COW-CALF
CREDIT.
This
bill
32


specifically
provides
for
a
cow-calf
operations
credit
based
33


on
the
provisions
in
the
1996
legislation
establishing
the
34


livestock
production
tax
credit.
The
income
threshold
for
35


-4-


LSB

H.F.
467


qualifying
taxpayers
is
increased
to
not
more
than
$144,358,
1


as
adjusted
each
year
for
inflation.
The
standing
limited
2


appropriation
is
increased
to
$4
million.
However,
the
same
3


method
is
used
for
calculating
the
payment
of
eligible
refund
4


claims
when
the
total
amount
of
such
claims
exceeds
the
5


appropriated
amount.
The
new
cow-calf
credit
applies
to
tax
6


years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2014.
