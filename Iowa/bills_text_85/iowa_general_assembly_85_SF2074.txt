EXPLANATION
23


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
24


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
25


This
bill
relates
to
provisions
currently
contained
in
Code
26


section
22.7,
dealing
with
confidential
public
records.
27


Code
section
22.7,
subsection
5,
provides
that
peace
28


officers’
investigative
reports,
and
specific
portions
29


of
electronic
mail
and
telephone
billing
records
of
law
30


enforcement
agencies
are
to
be
regarded
as
confidential
if
31


that
information
is
part
of
an
ongoing
investigation
unless
32


disclosure
is
authorized
elsewhere
in
the
Code.
There
is

and
circumstances
surrounding
a
crime
or
incident
except
1


where
disclosure
would
plainly
and
seriously
jeopardize
an
2


investigation
or
pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
safety
3


of
an
individual.
4


Similarly,
Code
section
22.7,
subsection
18,
confers
5


confidential
status
on
communications
not
required
by
law,
6


rule,
procedure,
or
contract
made
to
a
government
body
or
7


to
any
of
its
employees
by
identified
persons
outside
of
8


government,
to
the
extent
that
the
government
body
receiving
9


those
communications
from
such
persons
outside
of
government
10


could
reasonably
believe
that
those
persons
would
be
11


discouraged
from
making
them
to
that
government
body
if
they
12


were
available
for
general
public
examination.
Exceptions
13


providing
for
public
access
include
information
conveying
14


the
date,
time,
specific
location,
and
immediate
facts
and
15


circumstances
surrounding
the
occurrence
of
a
crime
or
other
16


illegal
act,
except
to
the
extent
that
its
disclosure
would
17


plainly
and
seriously
jeopardize
a
continuing
investigation
or
18


pose
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
safety
of
any
person.
19


In
both
instances,
the
bill
provides
that
an
enhanced
911
20


audio
recording
received
by
a
public
safety
answering
point,
21


as
defined
in
Code
section
34A.2,
that
conveys
the
date,
22


time,
specific
location,
or
immediate
facts
or
circumstances
23


surrounding
a
crime
or
incident,
and
is
otherwise
not
24


considered
confidential,
shall
be
kept
confidential
but
a
25


written
transcript
of
the
audio
recording
shall
not
be
kept
26


confidential.
