DIVISION

——
HIGHWAYS.
Under
current
law,
the
DOT
has
12


the
responsibility
for
regulating
junkyards
along
interstate
13


highways.
This
bill
extends
the
scope
of
that
responsibility
14


to
include
all
highways
on
the
national
highway
system.
The
15


“national
highway
system”
is
designated
by
the
federal
highway
16


administration
in
consultation
with
the
DOT
and
consists
of
17


certain
interconnected
urban
and
rural
principal
arterials
and
18


highways.
19


The
bill
prohibits
the
establishment,
operation,
or
20


maintenance
of
a
junkyard
within
1,000
feet
of
the
nearest
21


edge
of
the
right-of-way
of
any
highway
on
the
national
22


highway
system
unless
the
junkyard
is
not
visible
from
the
23


main-traveled
portion
of
the
highway
or
is
screened
from
view;
24


is
located
within
areas
zoned
for
industrial
use;
or
is
located
25


in
an
unzoned
industrial
area
defined
by
DOT
regulations.
26


However,
a
junkyard
in
a
zoned
or
unzoned
industrial
area
27


lawfully
in
existence
on
July
1,
2014,
which
is
within
1,000
28


feet
of
the
right-of-way
and
visible
from
the
main-traveled
29


portion
of
the
highway
shall
be
screened,
if
feasible,
by
the
30


DOT
or
by
the
owner
at
the
direction
of
the
DOT.
31


Under
current
law,
the
DOT
regulates
billboards
along
32


interstates
and
primary
highways.
The
bill
expands
the
scope
33


of
that
regulation
by
redefining
“primary
highways”
to
include
34


all
highways
on

indicated
by
the
arrow,
but
must
