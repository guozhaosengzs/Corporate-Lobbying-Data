one

EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
requires
food
items
to
be
labeled
with
information
7


that
identifies
the
food
items
as
genetically
modified.
The
8


department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
is
responsible
9


for
administering
and
enforcing
the
bill’s
provisions.
A
10


person
manufacturing
a
packaged
food
item
must
disclose
whether
11


it
was
or
may
have
been
subjected
to
genetic
engineering
12


when
produced,
and
a
person
selling
an
unpackaged
food
item
13


on
a
retail
basis
must
disclose
whether
it
was
or
may
have
14


been
subjected
to
genetic
engineering
when
produced.
The
15


disclosure
must
appear
on
a
printed
label
and
either
affixed
16


to
a
packaged
food
item
or
placed
near
a
container
holding
17


unpackaged
food
items.
The
label
must
be
based
on
federal
18


ingredient
labeling
standards
unless
the
department
establishes
19


alternative
standards.
The
bill
creates
an
exception
for
a
20


small
business
which
has
either
fewer
than
20
employees
or
21


an
annual
gross
income
of
less
than
$4
million.
A
person
22


manufacturing
a
packaged
food
item
who
fails
to
comply
with
23


the
labeling
standards,
or
a
person
selling
or
offering
to
24


sell
an
unpackaged
food
item
on
a
retail
basis
and
who
fails
25


to
comply
with
the
labeling
standards,
is
subject
to
civil
26


penalties.
The
civil
penalty
equals
$100
per
food
item
that
is
27


not
labeled
in
compliance
with
the
bill’s
provisions.
However,
28


under
certain
circumstances
a
manufacturer’s
civil
penalty
is
29


capped
at
$10,000
for
the
sale
or
offer
for
sale
of
a
single
30


manufactured
lot
of
packaged
food
items
and
a
retail
dealer’s
31


civil
penalty
is
capped
at
$1,000
for
the
sale
or
offer
for
32


sale
of
a
single
container
of
unpackaged
food
items.
