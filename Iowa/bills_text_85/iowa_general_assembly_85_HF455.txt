22


EXPLANATION
23


This
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
vehicular
transportation
24


for
students.
25


The
bill
assigns
to
area
education
agencies
the
duty
of
26


initially
reviewing
transportation
disputes
between
school
27


districts
and
the
authority
to
resolve
such
disputes.
The
28


bill
requires
the
reviewing
agency
board
to
notify
each
29


affected
local
school
board
of
its
decision,
and
allows
an
30


affected
school
district
to
appeal
a
decision
to
the
director
31


of
the
department
of
education.
The
bill
does
not
apply
to
32


transportation
disputes
relating

under
Code
33


section

34


The
bill

H.F.

carry
not
more
than
nine
persons
which
are
used
to
transport
1


pupils
to
activity
events
in
which
students
are
participating
2


must
conform
to
minimum
vehicle
safety
inspection
standards
for
3


school
buses
as
far
as
practicable
and
as
set
out
by
the
state
4


board
of
education
by
rule.
The
bill
directs
the
state
board
5


of
education
to
adopt
rules
for
required,
uniform
inspections
6


of
such
vehicles.
The
rules
must
allow
for
inspections
to
be
7


conducted
by
qualified
private
automobile
mechanics
or
the
8


department
of
education.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
9


drivers
of
such
vehicles,
whether
school-owned
or
privately
10


owned,
are
exempt
from
statutory
requirements
for
a
certificate
11


of
qualification
and
an
approved
course
of
instruction
that
12


apply
to
school
bus
drivers.
13


Current
law
provides
that
a
school
board,
individual,
or
14


organization
must
not
purchase,
construct,
or
contract
for
15


use
of
a
school
bus
that
does
not
comply
with
minimum
state
16


standards.
Current
law
provides
that
any
person
who
authorizes
17


such
an
action
is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor.
The
bill
18


adds
certain
other
vehicles
used
to
transport
students
to
19


school
activities
to
those
requirements.
A
simple
misdemeanor
20


is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
21


of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
both.
22


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
23


section
25B.3.
The
bill
requires
that
the
state
cost
of
24


any
state
mandate
included
in
the
bill
be
paid
by
a
school
25


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
26


school
district
under
Code
section
257.16.
The
specification
27


is
deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
28


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
29


inclusion
of
this
specification
is
intended
to
reinstate
the
30


requirement
of
political
subdivisions
to
comply
with
any
state
31


mandates
included
in
the
bill.
