EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
relates
to
property
taxes
of
veterans
and
members
8


of
the
armed
forces.
9


The
disabled
veterans
tax
credit
under
Code
section
425.15
10


provides
a
credit
on
the
homestead
of
an
eligible
veteran
11


who
acquired
the
homestead
under
specified
federal
programs
12


in
an
amount
equal
to
the
entire
amount
of
the
tax
levied
on
13


the
homestead.
This
bill
modifies
the
qualifications
for
the
14


disabled
veterans
tax
credit
by
adding
to
the
list
of
veterans
15


who
are
eligible
for
the
credit,
the
following:
(1)
a
veteran
16


as
defined
in
Code
section
35.1
with
a
permanent
and
total
17


service-connected
disability
as
certified
by
the
United
States
18


department
of
veterans
affairs;
and
(2)
a
former
member
of
the
19


national
guard
of
any
state
who
otherwise
meets
the
service
20


requirements
for
Iowa
national
guard
members
under
Code
section
21


35.1(2)(b),
subparagraph
(2)
or
(7),
with
a
permanent
and
total
22


service-connected
disability
as
certified
by
the
United
States
23


department
of
veterans
affairs.
The
bill
also
strikes
the
24


income
limitation
qualifications
for
the
disabled
veteran
tax
25


credit.
26


The
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
425.15A,
which
provides
27


that
the
property
tax
on
a
disabled
veteran’s
homestead
shall
28


not
increase
from
year
to
year.
To
receive
this
credit,
the
29


veteran
must
file
on
or
before
June
30
in
a
manner
similar
30


to
filing
for
the
regular
homestead
credit.
Once
the
claim
31


is
filed
and
allowed,
the
veteran
does
not
have
to
file
for
32


successive
years
so
long
as
the
property
is
still
owned
and
33


used
by
the
veteran
as
a
homestead.
34


The
bill
defines
“disabled
veteran”

the
purposes
