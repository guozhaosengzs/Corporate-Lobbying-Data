EXPLANATION
19


BACKGROUND.
The
department
of
natural
resources
20


(department)
is
required
to
regulate
confinement
feeding
21


operations
(operations)
under
Code
chapter
459,
the
“Animal
22


Agriculture
Compliance
Act”.
This
bill
amends
provisions
in
23


subchapter
III
which
govern
water
quality,
including
how
and
24


when
manure
from
such
operations
is
to
be
applied
to
land.
25


CURRENT
ANIMAL
UNIT
CAPACITY
FORMULA
TO
DETERMINE
AN
26


OPERATION’S
SIZE.
To
some
extent,
the
degree
of
regulation
27


depends
upon
an
operation’s
size
which
is
determined
by
28


calculating
its
animal
unit
capacity;
the
maximum
number
29


of
animal
units
that
may
be
maintained
in
all
confinement
30


buildings
(buildings)
at
any
one
time
(Code
section
459.102).
31


Each
of
various
types
of
animals
are
assigned
a
special
32


equivalency
factor.
For
example,
a
butcher
or
breeding
swine
33


weighing
more
than
55
pounds
has
a
factor
of
0.4
animal
units
34


(Code
section
459.102).
Generally,
when
calculating
the
animal
35

S.F.

unit
capacity
of
an
operation,
buildings
constructed
as
part
1


of
the
operation
are
included
regardless
of
whether
they
are
2


occupied,
except
if
a
building
has
been
abandoned,
i.e.,
has
3


been
razed
or
converted
to
another
use
(Code
section
459.301).
4


SMALL
ANIMAL
FEEDING
OPERATIONS.
The
current
law
provides
5


a
special
regulatory
exemption
for
small
animal
feeding
6


operations,
which
have
an
animal
unit
capacity
of
500
or
7


fewer
animal
units
(Code
section
459.102).
For
example,
a
8


confinement
feeding
operation
with
three
buildings
keeping
9


a
maximum
of
400
butcher
or
breeding
swine
in
each
of
two
10


buildings
and
no
animals
in
the
third
empty
building
would
not
11


qualify
as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
if
the
capacity
12


of
the
three
buildings
were
600,
500,
and
300
animal
units,
13


respectively
(1,400
x
0.4
=
560).
14


NEW
FORMULA
——
RECLASSIFYING
CONFINEMENT
FEEDING
OPERATIONS
15


BASED
ON
MAXIMUM
NUMBER
OF
ANIMAL
UNITS.
The
bill
allows
a
16


person
to
elect
to
be
exempt
from
filing
a
manure
management
17


plan
update
(update)
with
the
department
and
paying
an
18


associated
annual
compliance
fee
(fee)
if
the
person
can
19


reclassify
the
operation
as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
20


using
a
new
formula
which
is
based
on
the
maximum
number
21


of
animal
units
actually
housed
at
the
confinement
feeding
22


operation
at
any
one
time
during
the
election
period.
An
23


update
is
required
to
be
filed
by
a
person
who
owns
a
24


confinement
feeding
operation
or
who
applies
manure
from
a
25


confinement
feeding
operation
located
outside
the
state
(Code
26


section
459.312).
Both
the
original
plan
and
the
update
must
27


include
the
latest
information
regarding
manure
application.
28


Using
the
example
above,
the
operation
could
elect
to
be
exempt
29


as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
(800
x
0.4
=
320).
The
30


bill
provides
that
the
department
must
determine
the
period
31


of
election
so
long
as
the
minimum
election
period
equals
the
32


duration
of
the
updated
plan.
However,
the
election
period
33


automatically
terminates
if
the
operation
no
longer
qualifies
34


as
a
small
animal
feeding
operation
as
calculated
using
the
new

CIVIL
PENALTIES.
A
person
who
violates
Code
chapter
459,
2


subchapter
III
is
subject
to
a
civil
penalty.
The
department
3


is
authorized
to
impose
a
range
of
civil
penalties
based
4


on
a
number
of
criteria.
The
general
civil
penalty
cannot
5


exceed
$10,000
(Code
sections
459.603
and
455B.109).
A
6


person
violating
a
provision
is
also
subject
to
judicial
7


action
brought
by
the
attorney
general
(Code
sections
459.603
8


and
455B.191).
The
general
civil
penalty
applicable
for
a
9


violation
cannot
exceed
$5,000.
