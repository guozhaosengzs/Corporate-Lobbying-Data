EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
modifies
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
tax
credit
11


program,
which
is
a
pilot
program
enacted
in
2006
to
allow
12


the
diversion
of
withholding
funds
paid
by
an
employer
to
be
13


matched
by
a
designated
pilot
project
city
to
create
economic
14


incentives
that
can
be
directed
toward
businesses
located
15


within
urban
renewal
areas
in
the
city
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
16


a
withholding
agreement
with
a
business
and
after
approval
of
17


the
agreement
by
the
Iowa
economic
development
authority.
18


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
an
employer
that
is
a
19


party
to
a
withholding
agreement
with
a
pilot
project
city
be
20


located
in
an
urban
renewal
area.
The
bill
removes
a
similar
21


requirement
relating
to
the
definition
of
targeted
job.
The
22


bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
Code
section
403.19A
to
23


reflect
the
removal
of
the
urban
renewal
area
requirement,
24


including
providing
that
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
credits
25


be
deposited
in
a
withholding
project
fund
rather
than
the
26


special
fund
established
for
urban
renewal
purposes.
27


The
bill
allows
a
pilot
project
city
to
provide
for
the
28


deposit
of
the
amount
of
the
targeted
jobs
withholding
credit
29


into
the
city’s
withholding
project
fund
by
resolution,
rather
30


than
by
ordinance.
31


The
bill
provides
a
definition
of
long-term
lease
costs
as
32


part
of
the
definition
of
qualifying
investment
under
the
pilot
33


program
and
provides
a
definition
of
retained
job.

Under

law,

and
the

12


agreement
payment
and
receipt
information
by
the
employer,
13
