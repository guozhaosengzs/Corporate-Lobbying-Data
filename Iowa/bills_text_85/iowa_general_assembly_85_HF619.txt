EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
provides
for
the
registration
of
all-terrain
4


vehicles
for
operation
on
certain
Iowa
roads.
5


Code
section
321.1
defines
“all-terrain
vehicle”
as
a
motor
6


vehicle
designed
to
travel
on
three
or
more
wheels
and
designed
7


primarily
for
off-road
recreational
use.
The
definition
8


includes
off-road
utility
vehicles,
but
excludes
farm
tractors
9


or
equipment,
construction
equipment,
forestry
vehicles,
10


and
lawn
and
grounds
maintenance
vehicles.
Currently,
the
11


department
of
natural
resources
regulates
all-terrain
vehicles
12


for
purposes
of
off-road
recreational
use.
All-terrain
13


vehicles
are
not
permitted
on
Iowa
roads,
except
under
limited
14


circumstances.
15


Under
the
bill,
the
owner
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
designed
16


to
travel
on
four
or
more
wheels
may
register
the
vehicle
17


with
the
department
of
transportation
through
the
county
18


treasurer.
The
annual
registration
fee
is
$50.
The
size
19


of
license
plates
to
be
issued
for
all-terrain
vehicles
will
20


be
determined
by
the
department
of
transportation.
Because
21


all-terrain
vehicles
are
currently
subject
to
sales
tax,
22


the
bill
provides
that
all-terrain
vehicles
are
exempt
from
23


the
fee
for
new
registration
imposed
on
vehicles
subject
to
24


registration,
so
long
as
the
owner
has
paid
the
Iowa
sales
25


tax
or
the
appropriate
tax
in
another
state
at
the
time
of
26


purchase.
If
an
all-terrain
vehicle
is
exempt
from
sales
tax,
27


the
vehicle
is
also
exempt
from
the
fee
for
new
registration.
28


Registration
with
the
department
of
transportation
does
not
29


exempt
the
owner
from
the
current
requirement
to
register
the
30


all-terrain
vehicle
with
the
department
of
natural
resources,
31


and
the
department
of
natural
resources
will
continue
to
32


issue
certificates
of
title
for
all-terrain
vehicles.
The
33


bill
requires
an
applicant
for
registration
of
an
all-terrain
34


vehicle
with
the
department
of
transportation
to
present
a
35

copy
of
the
registration
receipt
issued
by
the
department
of
1


natural
resources
containing
a
description
of
the
vehicle
and
2


identifying
the
applicant
as
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
The
3


bill
specifies
that
a
manufacturer’s
label
certifying
that
the
4


vehicle
meets
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
is
not
5


required
for
registration
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
with
the
6


department
of
transportation,
and
current
provisions
under
7


the
purview
of
the
department
of
transportation
relating
to
8


the
regulation
of
motor
vehicle
dealers,
manufacturers,
and
9


distributors
or
to
the
sale,
rental,
lease,
transfer,
or
10


disposition
of
motor
vehicles
do
not
apply
to
all-terrain
11


vehicles.
12


The
bill
provides
that
an
all-terrain
vehicle
registered
13


with
the
department
of
transportation
may
be
operated
on
14


secondary
roads,
but
not
on
primary
highways,
except
to
15


cross
over
a
primary
highway,
and
not
on
highways
within
the
16


corporate
limits
of
a
city
except
where
all-terrain
vehicles
17


are
permitted
by
ordinance.
Under
the
bill,
a
city
may
18


authorize
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
registered
19


with
the
department
of
transportation
on
highways
under
the
20


city’s
jurisdiction
other
than
municipal
extensions
of
primary
21


highways.
The
bill
strikes
current
provisions
in
Code
chapter
22


321I
that
allow
cities
and
counties
to
designate
roads
under
23


their
jurisdiction
for
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
24


registered
with
the
department
of
natural
resources.
25


The
bill
states
that
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
26


vehicle
on
a
highway
must
be
at
least
16
years
of
age
and
have
27


a
valid
driver’s
license
other
than
a
license
valid
only
for
28


the
operation
of
a
motorized
bicycle.
Iowa
motor
vehicle
laws
29


apply
to
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
30


except
those
equipment
provisions
which
by
their
nature
can
31


have
no
practical
application.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
32


operator
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
must
carry
proof
of
motor
33


vehicle
financial
liability
coverage,
and
the
all-terrain
34


vehicle
must
meet
requirements
for
headlamps,
rear
lamps,

and

signals.
Current
speed
limits
apply
to
all-terrain
1


vehicles
operated
on
a
highway,
except
that
an
all-terrain
2


vehicle
may
not
be
operated
at
a
speed
exceeding
45
miles
per
3


hour.
4


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“vehicles
subject
to
5


registration”
for
purposes
of
the
exemption
from
the
sales
and
6


use
tax,
to
exclude
all-terrain
vehicles
and
off-road
utility
7


vehicles
registered
for
operation
on
highways,
in
order
to
8


continue
the
applicability
of
the
sales
tax
to
those
vehicles.
9


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
10


vehicle
on
a
highway
in
violation
of
current
restrictions
11


commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
12


of
$50.
The
bill
establishes
the
same
penalty
for
a
person
13


who
operates
a
registered
all-terrain
vehicle
in
violation
of
14


minimum
age
and
licensing
requirements
or
on
a
highway
where
15


all-terrain
vehicle
operation
is
not
authorized.
16


The
bill
makes
conforming
amendments
to
Code
chapter
17


321I,
relating
to
the
regulation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
by
18


the
department
of
natural
resources.
The
bill
also
amends
19


definitions
in
Code
chapters
applicable
to
motor
vehicle
20


dealers,
motor
vehicle
franchisers,
the
leasing
and
renting
21


of
motor
vehicles,
vehicle
recyclers,
motor
vehicle
service
22


contracts,
and
motor
vehicle
service
trade
practices,
to
23


continue
to
exclude
all-terrain
vehicles
from
those
provisions.
