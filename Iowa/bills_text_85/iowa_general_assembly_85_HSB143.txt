EXPLANATION
10


BACKGROUND.
The
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
Act”
(Code
11


chapter
490),
a
model
Act
adopted
by
the
American
Bar
12


Association,
governs
the
requirements
for
the
creation,
13


organization,
and
operation
of
corporations
and
the
14


relationship
between
shareholders,
directors,
and
officers
of
15


the
corporation.
Generally,
the
Act’s
provisions
establish
16


default
requirements
and
procedures
which
may
be
modified
by
a
17


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws.
18


PUBLIC
CORPORATIONS.
A
public
corporation
is
a
corporation
19


that
has
a
class
of
voting
stock
that
is
listed
on
a
national
20


securities
exchange
or
held
of
record
by
more
than
2,000
21


shareholders
(Code
section
490.140).
The
bill
amends
the
22


definition
to
eliminate
the
reference
to
a
class
of
shares
23


or
number
of
shareholders.
It
provides
that
a
corporation
24


is
public
if
traded
in
a
market
maintained
by
a
member
of
25


the
national
securities
association.
The
bill
also
amends
26


a
provision
regulating
shareholder
agreements
that
govern
a
27


corporation’s
corporate
affairs
including
by
eliminating
or
28


restricting
the
powers
of
its
board
of
directors
(Code
section
29


490.732).
Specifically,
the
bill
provides
that
a
shareholder
30


agreement
is
automatically
terminated
when
the
corporation
31


becomes
public.
These
provisions
take
effect
January
1,
2015.
32


NOTICES,
DOCUMENTS,
AND
COMMUNICATION.
A
notice
must
be
33


in
writing
unless
oral
notice
is
reasonable
(Code
section
34


490.141).
The
bill
requires
that
notices
be
in
English.

It
provides
for
the
electronic
transmission
and
receipt
1


and
acknowledgment
of
information.
The
bill
replaces
the
2


requirement
that
documents
be
executed
with
a
requirement
3


that
they
be
signed,
including
documents
associated
with
4


the
adoption
or
abandonment
of
articles
of
merger
or
share
5


exchange
(Code
sections
490.1106
and
490.1108).
The
bill
also
6


authorizes
a
corporation
to
keep
its
records
in
an
electronic
7


form
so
long
as
it
can
be
converted
into
a
paper
form
(Code
8


section
490.1601).
The
corporation
is
required
to
deliver
a
9


written
notice,
report,
or
statement
to
shareholders
who
share
10


a
common
address,

with
delivery
requirements,

11


delivering
to
that
address,
unless
a
shareholder
makes
a
timely
12


objection
(Code
section
490.144).
13


QUALIFIED
DIRECTORS.
In
a
number
of
circumstances
a
14


director
must
be
considered
“disinterested”
when
taking
an
15


action
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
corporation.
The
bill
16


eliminates
the
term
“disinterested”
and
replaces
it
with
17


“qualified”
(Code
section
490.143;
see
Code
sections
490.853
18


and
490.855).
The
bill
requires
a
director
to
be
qualified
19


under
different
circumstances
which
may
involve
board
action
20


or
court
proceedings.
For
purposes
of
dismissing
a
derivative
21


proceeding
by
a
court
based
on
a
good-faith
determination
of
22


directors
(Code
section
490.744),
directors
are
qualified
if
23


they
do
not
have
a
material
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
24


proceeding
or
a
material
relationship
with
a
person
who
has
25


such
an
interest.
For
purposes
of
advancing
expenses
to
a
26


board
member
before
the
disposition
of
a
case
(Code
section
27


490.853)
or
later
indemnifying
a
director
(Code
section
28


490.855),
the
authorization
must
be
made
by
directors
who
are
29


qualified
because
they
are
not
parties
to
the
proceeding,
do
30


not
have
a
conflicting
interest
in
the
related
transaction,
31


and
do
not
have
a
material
relationship
with
a
director
32


who
is
a
party
or
has
a
conflicting
interest.
For
purposes

of
voting
to
excuse
a
director
from
a

For

opportunity
because
4


other
directors

DIRECTORS
AND
OFFICERS
——
FUNCTIONS
AND
DUTIES.
Generally,
9


a
corporation
must
have
a
board
of
directors,
unless
dispensed
10


with
pursuant
to
a
shareholder
agreement
(Code
sections
490.801
11


and
490.732).
The
bill
provides
that
the
business
affairs
of
a
12


corporation
may
be
subject
to
the
directors’
oversight
rather
13


than
direct
management.
It

officer
to

recipients
of
compensation
awards
(e.g.,
rights,
15


options,
or
warrants
associated
with
shares)
(Code
section
16


490.624).
The
bill
substitutes
the
term
“functions”
in
lieu
17


of
“duties”
in
some
places
when
referring
to
an
officer’s

SHAREHOLDER
MEETINGS
——

Shareholders
are

to
act
by

21


without
holding
a
meeting
if
the
action
is
taken
by
unanimous
22


written
consent
(Code
section
490.704).
The
bill
provides
that
23


except
for
a
public
corporation,
a
corporation’s
articles
of
24


incorporation
may
provide
for
shareholder
action
by
less

unanimous
written
consent,
if
a
written
consent
is
signed
by
26


shareholders
having
the
minimum

be
required
to
authorize
the
action
at
a
shareholder
meeting
28


assuming
that
all
shareholders
entitled
to
vote
were
present.
29


It
creates
a
corresponding
exception
to
the
requirement
30


that
a
corporation
must
hold
at
least
one
annual
shareholder
31


meeting,
presumably
to

directors
(Code

that
the

SHAREHOLDER
MEETING
——
RECORD
DATE.
A
corporation
3


establishes
procedures
for
providing
notice
to
and
voting
by
4


shareholders
at
a
meeting
(or
by
written
consent)
according
to
5


a

The

date
determines
both
shareholders
6


who
are
entitled
to
notice
of
the
meeting
and
to
vote
at
7


the

The
catch-all

states
that

is
the
date
before
notice
is
mailed
to
a
voting
group
or
9


shareholders
(Code

although
a

10

According

corporation
may
be
required
to
provide
a
list
of
names
of
19


shareholders
entitled

The

date
is
21


also
used
to
determine
when
appraisal
rights
of
shareholders
22


apply
(Code
section
490.1302).
The
bill
requires
shareholders’
23


appraisal
rights
to
be
triggered
on
the
record
date
by
tying
24


it
only
to
when
a
shareholder
is
entitled
to
receive
notice
25


and
not
when
entitled

vote
on
the

The
bill
also
26


provides
that
the

may
fix
a
record
date
for
determining
27


when
a
shareholder
is
entitled

that
is
different
than

the

ELECTIONS
AND
VOTING
——
CUMULATIVE
VOTING.
Generally,
4


directors
are
elected
by
a
plurality
of
votes
cast
unless
the
5


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
provide
for
cumulative
6


voting
allowing
shareholders
to
cast
all
their
votes
for
a
7


single
candidate
(Code

provides
8


that
shareholders

9


cannot
so
vote
unless
the

authorizes
it,
or
a

LEGAL
PROCEEDING
——
DERIVATIVE
ACTIONS.
As
a
result
of
a

derivative
action,
the
court
may
order
a
corporation
to
pay
14


the
plaintiff’s
expenses
(defined
in
Code
section
490.140)
15


if
the
court
determines
that
the
proceeding
has
resulted
in
16


substantial
benefit
to
the
corporation
and
alternatively
may
17


order
the
plaintiff
to
pay
the
defendant’s
expenses
if
it
18


finds
the
proceeding
was
commenced
without
reasonable
cause
19


or
for
an
improper
purpose
(Code

The

21


of
attorney
fees.

PROCEEDINGS
——
COURT
APPOINTMENT
OF
A
CUSTODIAN

from
a
24


court,
due
to
an
injury
suffered
by
the
corporation
due
to
the

inaction
of
the
board
(through
deadlock
or
fraud)
or
26


because
the

all
28


authority

effect,
including
upon
the
31


happening
of
a
specific

provides
that

where
a

was
elected
2


by
a
voting
group
of

only
directors

(Code

6


RIGHT
OF
SHAREHOLDERS

The

provides
that
a

corporation
may
agree
to
submit
a
matter
to
a
vote
of
its
8


shareholders
even
if
the
board
determines
not
to
recommend
9


the
matter
(Code

It
expressly
authorizes
10


such
vote
on
an
amendment
to
the
corporation’s
articles
of
11


incorporation
(Code
section
490.1003),
an

PROCEEDINGS
——
ADVANCING
FUNDS
TO
A
DIRECTOR
OR
INDEMNIFYING
16


A
DIRECTOR
FOR
EXPENSES.
A
corporation
may
advance
funds
to
a
17


director
or
indemnify
the
director
for
legal
expenses
incurred
18


in
the
course
of
a
director’s
defense
of
an
act
or
omission
19


(Code
sections
490.850,
490.853,
490.855,
and
490.858).
The
20


bill
provides
that
in
the
case
of
advances,
writings
required
21


to
be
submitted
to
the
board
(e.g.,
an
affirmation
that
the
22


director
acted
in
compliance
with
applicable
standards
of
23


conduct
or
a
promise
to
repay
advanced
funds)
must
be
in
24


writing
(Code
section
490.853).
It
also
provides
that
when
25


the
board
authorizes
an
advance
or
indemnification,
the
voting
26


directors
must
be
qualified
rather
than
disinterested
(Code
27


sections
490.853
and
490.854).
Finally,
the
bill
provides
that
28


the
defending
director’s
right
to
an
advance
or
indemnification
29


in
effect
prior
to
the
director’s
act
or
omission
cannot
be

eliminated
or
impaired
after
the
conduct
occurred,
unless
that
31


right
was
expressly
qualified
in
the
authorization
(i.e.,
in

DIRECTOR’S
CONFLICT
OF

a
35


-62-


LSB

(2)
85


da/nh
62/

H.F.
_____


director
is
prohibited
from
taking
action
on
a
matter
which
1


would
be
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
corporation.
The
2


bill
replaces
the
current
provision
addressing
a
director’s
3


conflict
of
interest
(Code
section
490.832)
with
four
4


provisions
(Code
sections
490.860
through
490.863)
that
5


govern
conflicting
interest
transactions.
In
order
to
be
so
6


classified,
a
transaction
must
be
effectuated
or
proposed
to
7


be
effectuated
by
the
corporation
or
an
entity
controlled
8


by
the
corporation.
In
addition,
the
director
must
be
in
a
9


special
position
to
take
personal
advantage
of
the
transaction,
10


as
a
party
to
the
transaction
or
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
11


the
director,
or
a
related
person,
has
a
material
financial
12


interest
in
the
transaction.
The
bill
provides
that
a
director
13


is
related
to
a
person
if
the
person
is
a
close
family
member,
14


an
individual
who
lives
in
the
same
home,
or
another
entity
15


controlled
by
the
director.
The
bill
provides
that
in
order
16


for
a
court
to
invalidate
a
transaction
or
otherwise
provide
a
17


legal
or
equitable
remedy,
such
conduct
must
fall
within
the
18


statutory
parameters
(Code
section
490.861).
The
definition
19


of
“director’s
conflicting
interest
transaction”
requires
20


knowledge
of
the
transaction,
except
where
the
director
is
a
21


party.
In
addition,
the
transaction
must
occur
at
a
relevant
22


time,
meaning
the
time
at
the
which
the
director’s
action
is
23


required
(e.g.,
a
board
vote)
or
when
the
director’s
action
24


somehow
consummates
the
transaction
(Code
section
490.862).
25


DIRECTOR’S
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
——
EXCUSED
TRANSACTIONS
26


(SAFE
HARBOR
EXCEPTION).
The
bill
excuses
a
director’s
27


conduct,
and
consequently
validates
the
transaction,
even
if
28


there
exists
a
conflicting
interest
transaction
(Code
section
29


490.861),
sometimes
referred
to
as
“safe
harbor”,
in
certain
30


circumstances.
First,
it
may
be
excused
if
a
majority
of
31


qualified
directors
(but
not
less
than
two)
vote
to
approve
32


the
transaction
or
the
action
is
approved
by
an
authorized
33


committee
in
which
all
members
are
qualified
directors
(Code
34


section
490.862).
The
director
who
has
the
conflict
must
35


-63-


LSB

H.F.
_____


disclose
information
regarding
the
conflict
to
the
extent
that
1


the
information
is
not
required
to
be
protected
under
law
or
2


some
ethical
rule
of
confidentiality
(Code
section
490.862).
3


The
transaction
is
excused
if
the
shareholders
later
ratify
4


the
transaction
according
to
specific
procedural
requirements
5


(Code
section
490.863)
after
disclosure
(but
no
provision
for
6


limited
disclosure).
Finally,
the
transaction
is
excused
if
7


the
transaction
is
fair
to
the
corporation,
although
neither
8


directors’
nor
shareholders’
action
was
taken.
The
bill
9


provides
that
in
any
legal
action
attacking
a
director,
the
10


plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof
(Code
section
490.831).
11


DIRECTOR’S
BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY
(SAFE
HARBOR
EXCEPTION).
12


An
analogous
situation
to
a
conflicting
interest
transaction
13


is
when
a
director
seeks
a
corporation’s
permission
prior
to
14


the
director’s
action.
The
bill
allows
qualified
directors
15


or
shareholders
to
disclaim
the
corporation’s
interest
before
16


the
director
proceeds
in
taking
advantage
of
the
business
17


opportunity
(see
Code
section
490.870).
Instead
of
making
a
18


“required
disclosure”
as
provided
for
conflicts
(Code
sections
19


490.860
and
490.862),
the
director
must
provide
the
corporation
20


material
facts
concerning
the
business
opportunity
then
21


known.
The
qualified
directors
or
shareholders
disclaiming
22


the
corporation’s
interest
must
be
done
in
the
same
manner
23


as
if
the
matter
concerned
a
director’s
conflicting
interest
24


transaction
(Code
sections
490.862
and
490.863).
However,
a
25


director’s
decision
not
to
use
the
procedures
for
disclaimer
26


does
not
create
a
negative
inference
or
alter
a
burden
of
27


proof
in
a
subsequent
action
alleging
an
improper
taking
of
a
28


corporate
opportunity.
29


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
GENERAL
RULE.
A
number
of
30


corporate
actions
may
trigger
the
right
of
a
shareholder
to
31


obtain
an
appraisal
of
the
corporation
and
obtain
fair
payment
32


of
shares,
including
mergers,
share
exchanges,
disposition
33


of
assets,
amendments
to
the
articles
of
incorporation,
and
34


conversion
of
the
corporation

entity

-64-


LSB
1488YC
(2)

H.F.
_____


490.1302).
A
corporation
must
pay
shareholders
the
amount
the
1


corporation
estimates
to
be
the
fair
value
of
the
shares
plus
2


interest
(Code
section
490.1324).
3


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATION
ON
THE
GENERAL
4


RULE
(MARKET-OUT
EXCEPTION).
The
general
rule
is
limited
in
5


the
case
where
there
are
at
least
2,000
shareholders
and
the
6


market
value
of
the
shares
equals
at
least
$20
million
(the
7


so-called
“market-out”
exception),
presumably
because
the
true
8


value
for
the
shares
can
be
obtained
on
the
market.
However,
9


the
amount
does
not
include
shares
held
by
the
corporation’s
10


subsidiaries,
senior
executives,
directors,
and
beneficial
11


shareholders
owning
more
than
10
percent
of
the
shares.
12


“Beneficial
ownership”
refers
to
the
control
of
shares
by
a
13


person
who
does
not
own
them
including
the
power
to
vote,
or
to
14


direct
the
voting
of
the
shares
(Code
section
490.1302).
15


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
NEW
MARKET-OUT
EXCEPTIONS.
16


The
bill
provides
two
new
categories
under
the
market-out
17


exception:
(1)
when
the
shares
are
classified
as
a
covered
18


security
regulated
by
the
United
States
securities
exchange
19


commission
under
the
federal
Securities
Act
of
1933,
and
(2)
20


when
the
shares
are
issued
by
an
open-end
management
investment
21


company
registered
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
22


under
the
federal
Investment
Company
Act
of
1940
(Code
section
23


490.1302).
24


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATIONS
ON
THE
25


MARKET-OUT
EXCEPTIONS.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
26


which
allows
shareholder
appraisal
rights
notwithstanding
27


the
market-out
exception
in
cases
where
the
corporation’s
28


shares
or
assets
are
being
acquired
or
converted,
whether
by
29


merger,
share
exchange,
or
otherwise
(Code
section
490.1302).
30


Instead,
the
bill
allows
such
rights
in
cases
where
the
31


corporate
action
involves
an
interested
transaction,
which
is
a
32


corporate
action,
other
than
a
merger,
involving
an
interested
33


person
in
which
the
shares
or
assets
of
the
corporation
are
34


being
acquired
or
converted.
A

5


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
NOTICE.
A
corporation
must
6


notify
shareholders
of
their
appraisal
rights
when
a
corporate
7


action
is
submitted
to
a
vote
at
a
shareholder
meeting
(Code
8


section
490.1320).
The
bill
provides
for
notice
when
approval
9


is
performed
by
written
consent
in
lieu
of
a
meeting
(Code
10


section
490.704).
A
shareholder
must
provide
notice
of
an
11


intent
to
exercise
appraisal
rights
before
the
corporate
action
12


(vote)
is
taken
(Code
section
490.1321).
In
order
to
remain
13


eligible
to
exercise
those
rights,
the
shareholder
must
not
14


vote
on
the
matter.
A
shareholder
who
plans
on
asserting
15


appraisal
rights
cannot
likewise
exercise
rights
after
signing
16


a
consent
in
favor
of
the
proposal
(Code
section
490.1321).
17


If
a
corporate
action
requiring
appraisal
rights
becomes
18


effective,
the
corporation
must
deliver
a
written
appraisal
19


notice
and
form
(Code
section
490.1322).
The
bill
provides
for
20


the
contents
of
the
notice,
including
information
regarding
21


an
announcement
to
shareholders
made
prior
to
the
date
the
22


corporate
action
became
effective
and
requires
a
shareholder
23


asserting
appraisal
rights
to
certify
beneficial
ownership.
24


The
bill
provides
for
perfecting
shareholder
appraisal
rights
25


by
signing
and
returning
the
form
(Code
section
490.1323).
The
26


bill
provides
an
estimated
(prepaid)
payment
to
shareholders
27


exercising
their
appraisal
rights
after
the
form’s
due
date
28


(Code

such
costs
against
the
corporation
or
shareholders
demanding
1


appraisal
(Code
section
490.1331).
The
bill
amends
the
2


provision
to
eliminate
a
court’s
discretion
to
assess
fees
3


associated
with
attorneys
and
experts.

SHAREHOLDER
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATION
ON
OTHER
REMEDIES.
The
5


bill
provides
that
a
corporate
action
triggering
a
right
to
6


appraisal
(Code
section
490.1302)
cannot
be
enjoined,
set
7


aside,
or
rescinded
by
a
shareholder
after
the
shareholder
8


has
approved
the
corporate
action
(Code
section
490.1340).
9


However,
this
limitation
does
not
apply
to
four
situations:
10


(1)
where
the
process
of
approving
the
corporate
action
was
11


flawed
(e.g.,
unauthorized
in
the
corporation’s
articles
of
12


incorporation),
(2)
the
corporate
action
was
procured
by
fraud,
13


(3)
the
corporate
action
was
an
interested
transaction
in
the
14


same
manner
as
a
director’s
conflicting
interest
transaction
15


(Code
section
490.860),
or
(4)
the
transaction
was
approved,
16


but
without
a
meeting
(Code
section
490.704)
and
by
less
17


than
unanimous
consent
and
the
challenge
is
brought
by
a
18


nonconsenting
director.

JUDICIAL
DISSOLUTION
——
LIMITATION
ON
ACTIONS.
A
court
may
20


dissolve
a
corporation
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
shareholders
21


on
a
number
of
grounds,
including
the
directors
are
deadlocked,
22


the
directors
are
acting
fraudulently,
the
shareholders
23


are
deadlocked,
or
there
is
waste
of
corporate
assets
(Code
24


section
490.1430).
The
bill
adds
a
new
ground,
that
the
25


corporation
has
abandoned
its
business
and
failed
to
liquidate
26


and
distribute
its
assets
and
dissolve.
The
bill
also
27


provides
that
the
right
of
a
shareholder
to
bring
the
action
28


does
not
apply
to
a
corporation
listed
on
the
New
York
stock
29


exchange,
the
American
stock
exchange,
an
exchange
owned
or
30


controlled
by
NASDAQ,
or
listed
on
a
system
owned
or
controlled
31


by
the
national
association
of
security
dealers
(NASD).
32


Alternatively,
it
does
not
apply
to
a
corporation
having
300
33


or
more
shareholders
holding
shares
valued
at
$20
million
34


or
more,

FOREIGN
CORPORATIONS
——

OF

The

provides
for
the
conversion
of
a
foreign

corporation

authorized
to
do

in
this
state
into

REPLACEMENT
OF
FUTURE
REPEALED
PROVISIONS.
In
2011,
the
9


general
assembly
enacted
SF
325
(2011
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
10


2),
carving
out
a
special
provision
which
provided
for
the
11


staggered
terms
of
directors
of
public
corporations
and
12


providing
for
the
repeal
of
the
Act
on
December
31,
2014.
13


The
Act
took
effect
on
March
23,
2011.
The
effect
of
the
14


repeal
is
to
restore
the
provisions
to
their
March
22,
2011
15


effective
date.
This
bill
amends
two
provisions
affected
by
SF
16


325.
First,
it
reenacts
a
definition
of
“public
corporation”
17


which
is
repealed
on
December
31,
2014
(Code
section
490.140).
18


Second,
it
rewrites
a
provision
which
provides
that
a
19


shareholder
agreement
is
nullified
when
a
corporation
becomes
a
20


public
corporation
(Code
section
490.732).
