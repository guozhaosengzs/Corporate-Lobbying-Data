This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
matters
under
the
23


purview
of
the
department
of
transportation
(DOT).
24


DIVISION
I
——
HIGHWAYS.
Under
current
law,
the
DOT
has
25


the
responsibility
for
regulating
junkyards
along
interstate
26


highways.
This
bill
extends
the
scope
of
that
responsibility
27


to
include
all
highways
on
the
national
highway
system.
The
28


national
highway
system
is
designated
by
the
federal
highway
29


administration
in
consultation
with
the
DOT
and
consists
of
30


certain
interconnected
urban
and
rural
principal
arterials
and
31


highways.
32


The
bill
prohibits
the
establishment,
operation,
or
33


maintenance
of
a
junkyard
within
1,000
feet
of
the
nearest

unless
the
junkyard
is
not
visible
from
the

main-traveled
portion
of
the
highway
or
is
screened
from
view;
2


is
located
within
areas
zoned
for
industrial
use;
or
is
located
3


in
an
unzoned
industrial
area
defined
by
DOT
regulations.
4


However,
a
junkyard
in
a
zoned
or
unzoned
industrial
area
5


lawfully
in
existence
on
July
1,
2014,
which
is
within
1,000
6


feet
of
the
right-of-way
and
visible
from
the
main-traveled
7


portion
of
the
highway
shall
be
screened,
if
feasible,
by
the
8


DOT
or
by
the
owner
at
the
direction
of
the
DOT.
9


Under
current
law,
the
DOT
regulates
billboards
along
10


interstates
and
primary
highways.
The
bill
expands
the
scope
11


of
that
regulation
by
redefining
“primary
highways”
to
include
12


all
highways
on
the
national
highway
system
and
all
highways
13


on
the
federal-aid
primary
system
as
it
existed
on
June
1,
14


1991.
Certain
restrictions
on
the
placement
of
advertising
15


devices
are
amended
to
narrow
the
application
to
nonfreeway
or
16


noninterstate
primary
highways.

DIVISION
II
——
MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS.
Code
section
18


321.50
is
amended
to
provide
that
when
a
security
interest
is
19


noted
on
an
Iowa
certificate
of
title
and
in
the
statewide
20


computer
system
and
the
county’s
records,
it
can
be
presumed
21


that
the
security
interest
has
been
discharged
upon
the
22


presentation
of
a
valid
certificate
of
title
subsequently
23


issued
by
the
foreign
jurisdiction
on
which
the
security
24


interest
is
no
longer
noted.
25


The
bill
amends
a
provision
in
Code
section
321.176A
which
26


describes
the
exemption
from
commercial
driver’s
license
27


requirements
that
applies
to
farmers
and
persons
working
for
28


farmers.
The
bill
states
that
the
exemption
applies
to
a
29


farmer
or
a
person
working
for
a
farmer
while
operating
a
30


covered
farm
vehicle
as
defined
in
the
2012
federal
Moving
31


Ahead
for
Progress
in
the
21st
Century
Act,
also
known
as
32


MAP-21,
which
authorizes
surface
transportation
funding.
33


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321.187
to
allow
third-party
34


testers
to

commercial
driver’s
license,
provided
the
third-party
tester
1


administers
the
same
test
as
that
which
would
be
administered
2


by
the
state
and
complies
with
federal
regulations
for
testing
3


which
are
adopted
by
the
department
by
rule.
A
skills
test
4


examiner
used
by
a
third-party
tester
must
also
meet
federal
5


requirements.
The
DOT
is
directed
to
adopt
rules
requiring
6


that
a
third-party
tester,
other
than
a
community
college,
7


be
an
Iowa-based
motor
carrier,
or
its
subsidiary,
whose
8


principal
office
is
within
this
state
and
that
operates
a
9


permanent
commercial
driver
training
facility
in
this
state.
10


The
rules
may
also
require
a
third-party
tester
to
conduct
a
11


number
of
skills
test
examinations
above
the
number
required
12


under
federal
law
in
order
to
remain
qualified
as
a
third-party
13


tester.
The
changes
to
Code
section
321.187
take
effect
upon
14


enactment
and
are
repealed
five
years
later.
15


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321.257
to
describe
new
colored
16


lights
and
lighted
symbols
used
on
official
traffic-control
17


signals.
The
“steady
upraised
hand”
light
means
the
same
as
18


the
“don’t
walk”
light,
and
the
“walking
person”
light
means
19


the
same
as
the
“walk”
light.
The
“flashing
upright
hand”
20


and
the
“upraised
hand
with
countdown”
lights
are
pedestrian
21


signals
that
indicate
when
to
wait
before
crossing
or
proceed
22


to
a
safety
zone,
and
the
“upraised
hand
with
countdown”
23


light
also
indicates
the
time
remaining
for
the
pedestrian
to
24


complete
the
crossing.
The
“flashing
yellow
arrow”
light
means
25


vehicular
traffic
may
cautiously
enter
the
intersection
and
26


proceed
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
arrow,
but
must
yield
27


the
right-of-way
to
other
vehicles
and
pedestrians
lawfully
in
28


the
intersection
or
approaching
closely.
29


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321.258
to
update
descriptions
30


of
the
arrangement
of
lights
on
official
traffic-control
31


signals.
The
bill
adds
steady
and/or
flashing
left-turn
32


and
right-turn
red
arrows,
steady
left-turn
yellow
arrows,
33


and
flashing
left-turn
yellow

to

prescribed
