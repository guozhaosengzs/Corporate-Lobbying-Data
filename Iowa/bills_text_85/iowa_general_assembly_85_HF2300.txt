BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
TAX
CREDIT
TO
REIMBURSE
VETERINARIANS
2


PROVIDING
FEED
TO
LIVESTOCK.
The
bill
also
provides
that
if
a
3


local
authority
or
DALS
involves
a
veterinarian
who
feeds
the
4


livestock,
the
veterinarian
is
entitled
to
claim
an
annual
tax
5


credit
for
unreimbursed
expenses
up
to
$1,000.
6


BACKGROUND.
A
local
authority
may
be
a
party
to
a
civil
7


action
to
maintain
or
dispose
of
livestock
(cattle,
goats,
8


sheep,
horses,
swine,
ostriches,
rheas,
emus,
farm
deer
9


(e.g.,
confined
whitetail),
or
poultry),
in
cases
of
livestock
10


neglect
involving
a
responsible
person’s
failure
to
provide
the
11


livestock
with
care
or
who
injures
or
destroy
the
livestock,
12


including
to
comply
with
customary
animal
practices.
A
13


local
authority
may
rescue
the
livestock
and
provide
for
its
14


maintenance,
including
by
contracting
with
a
livestock
care
15


provider
(Code
section
717.2A).
DALS
may
also
be
a
party
of
16


a
civil
action

supervise,
or
appoint
a
qualified
person
to
17


supervise,
certain
species
of
livestock
(cattle,
sheep,
swine,
18


or
poultry).
In
both
cases,
a
local
authority
or
DALS
must
act
19


in
accordance
with
a
court
order
(Code
sections
717.3,
717.4,
20


and
717.5)
which
may
provide
for
the
sale
of
the
livestock
and
21


the
distribution
of
any
proceeds
to
cover
expenses
incurred
by
22


the
local
authority
or
DALS.
