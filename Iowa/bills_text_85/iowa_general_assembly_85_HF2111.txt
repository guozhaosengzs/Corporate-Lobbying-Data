This

provides
an

Currently,

6


percentage

the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
9


reserve
system
for
the
calendar
month
second
preceding

the
maximum
rate
based
thereon
will
be
11


effective,
rounded
to
the

The

limitation.

exemption.
The
bill
defines

transactions.
The

The
19


bill
defines

The
bill

22


to
mean
any

on
the
condition
that
the

be
redeemed
or
25


repurchased
by
the
seller
for
a
fixed
price
within
a

26


period
of
time.
Finally,
the
bill
defines
