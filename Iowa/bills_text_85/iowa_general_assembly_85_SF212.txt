EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
requires
a
railroad
company
to
post
whistle
11


warning
signs
along
railroad
tracks
owned
by
the
railroad.
12


A
sign
must
be
posted
approximately
1,320
feet
(one-quarter
13


mile)
in
each
direction
in
advance
of
each
public
highway-rail
14


crossing
where
the
sounding
of
a
locomotive
whistle
or
bell
is
15


required
pursuant
to
federal
or
state
law.
The
signs
must
be
16


made
of
reflective
material,
stand
at
least
60
inches
above
17


grade,
be
visible
to
both
the
engineer
and
conductor
of
a
18


train,
and
be
maintained
clear
of
obstructions.
19


A
missing
or
damaged
whistle
warning
sign
may
be
reported
by
20


an
engineer
or
conductor
by
written
notice
to
the
department
21


of
transportation.
Upon
receipt
of
a
report,
the
department
22


shall
notify
the
railroad
company
of
the
damaged
or
missing
23


sign,
and
the
railroad
company
is
required
to
replace
or
repair
24


the
sign
within
30
days
of
notification.
The
requirement
to
25


post
whistle
warning
signs
in
advance
of
public
highway-rail
26


crossings
does
not
apply
to
private
highway-rail
crossings
nor
27


to
public
highway-rail
crossings
that
are
subject
to
a
local
28


whistle
ban.
29


A
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
bill
is
a
schedule
30


“two”
violation.
Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
schedule
“two”
31


penalty
is
usually
imposed
on
a
railroad
company
for
failing
to
32


make
a
repair
of
railroad
facilities
ordered
by
the
department.
33


Each
day
that
a
violation
continues
constitutes
a
separate
34


offense.
