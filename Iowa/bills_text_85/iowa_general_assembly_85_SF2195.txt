Section

subsections

Code

are
amended
by
striking
the
subsections.


Sec.
18.
Section
477.9A,
Code
2014,
is
amended
to
read
as


follows:


477.9A
Deregulated
services.


1.


A
telegraph
or
telephone
company
whose
services
are


deregulated
by
the
board
under
section
476.1D
may
use
public


notice
as
a
means
of
conveying
terms
and
conditions
to


customers
where
identification
of
those
customers
is
infeasible


or
impractical.
Public
notice
may
also
be
used
to
convey


changes
in
terms
and
conditions,
other
than
price
increases
or


limitations
of
liability,
to
all
other
customers,
but
only
if


those
customers
were
put
on
notice
that
this
means
would
be


used
to
convey
subsequent
changes.
Notwithstanding
section


477.7
,
when
services
are
deregulated
by
the
board
under
section


476.1D
,
a
telegraph
or
telephone
company,
in
any
contract,


agreement,
or
by
means
of
public
notice,
may
reasonably
limit


its
liability
under
section
477.7
in
the
course
of
providing


the
deregulated
communications
services
to
its
customers,


except
for
acts
of
willful
misconduct.
However,
this
section


does
not
allow
a
greater
limitation
on
liability
than
exists
in


any
contract
or
approved
tariff
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the


deregulation
of
the
services.


2.


A
telephone
company
whose
services
are
subject
to


regulation
by
the
board
with
respect
to
terms
and
conditions,


but
not
rates,
shall
give
notice
of
rate
changes
to
customers.
