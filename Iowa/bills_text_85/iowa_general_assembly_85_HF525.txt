1


EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
concerns
the
period
of
validity
of
driver’s
3


licenses
and
nonoperator’s
identification
cards
issued
by
the
4


department
of
transportation.
5


The
bill
amends
Code
section
321.190
to
extend
the
validity
6


of
nonoperator’s
identification
cards
from
five
years
to
eight
7


years,
with
a
corresponding
fee
increase
from
$5
to
$8.
In
8


addition,
the
current
provision
that
provides
for
issuance
of
9


a
nonexpiring
nonoperator’s
identification
card
to
a
person
10


age
70
or
over
is
stricken.
Code
section
321.196
is
amended
11


to
extend
the
validity
of
a
driver’s
license
from
five
years
12


to
eight
years
for
licenses
issued
to
persons
between
the
ages
13


of
17
years,
11
months,
and
70
years.
Pursuant
to
current
14


law,
the
fee
for
a
driver’s
license
is
based
on
the
years
of
15


validity;
that
does
not
change
under
the
bill.
16


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
