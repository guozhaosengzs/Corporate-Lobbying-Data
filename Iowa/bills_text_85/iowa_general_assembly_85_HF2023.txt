H.F.
2023


A
person
commits
animal
neglect
by
failing
to
supply
the
1


animal
during
confinement
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
food
or
2


water;
failing
to
provide
a
confined
dog
or
cat
with
adequate
3


shelter;
or
torturing,
depriving
of
necessary
sustenance,
4


mutilating,
beating,
or
killing
an
animal
by
any
means
which
5


causes
unjustified
pain,
distress,
or
suffering.
The
law
does
6


not
apply
to
a
research
facility,
provided
that
the
research
7


facility
performs
functions
within
the
scope
of
accepted
8


practices
and
disciplines
(Code
section
162.2).
9


ANIMAL
TORTURE.
The
bill
increases
the
criminal
penalty
10


for
animal
torture
from
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
to
a
class
11


“D”
felony
beginning
with
the
first
offense.
Currently,
12


a
person
is
subject
to
a
felony
only
after
committing
a
13


second
or
subsequent
offense.
The
bill
also
eliminates
a
14


requirement
that
a
guilty
person
committing
a
first
offense
15


complete
a
community
work
requirement,
which
may
be
performed
16


at
an
animal
shelter.
The
bill
does
not
modify
an
existing
17


provision
requiring
a
guilty
person
to
undergo
psychological
18


evaluation
and
treatment.
It
also
retains
a
provision
that
19


gives
the
juvenile
court
exclusive
original
jurisdiction
in
20


cases
involving
children,
and
precludes
the
juvenile
court
from
21


waiving
jurisdiction
in
a
proceeding
concerning
an
offense
22


alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
a
child
under
the
age
of
17.
23


CRIMINAL
PENALTIES.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
24


confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a

of
at
least
25


$65
but
not
more

both.
A

is
punishable
by

is
punishable
by
