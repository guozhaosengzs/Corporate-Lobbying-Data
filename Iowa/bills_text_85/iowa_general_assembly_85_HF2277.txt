BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
VOTING
TRUSTS
AND
SHAREHOLDER
9


AGREEMENTS.
This
bill
amends
provisions
which
govern
voting
10


trusts
and
shareholder
agreements.
Through
these
arrangements,
11


shareholders
may
fundamentally
affect
how
a
corporation
is
12


controlled,
the
management
of
its
assets,
and
the
rights
and
13


duties
of
its
shareholders
and
officers
by
entering
into
14


certain
arrangements
(Code
sections
490.730
and
490.732).
This
15


bill
eliminates
a
10-year
term
restriction
imposed
on
a
voting
16


trust
or
shareholder
agreement.
However,
a
voting
trust
or
17


shareholder
agreement
formed
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
18


bill
continues
to
be
subject
to
the
10-year
term
restriction.
19


BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
FOR
SHAREHOLDERS.
20


The
bill
provides
that
a
corporation
other
than
a
public
21


corporation
(e.g.,
closed
corporation),
is
not
required
to
22


deliver
financial
statements
to
shareholders
if
the
corporation
23


files
certain
reports
with
a
state
or
federal
agency.
The
24


reports
must
include
a
balance
sheet
as
of
the
end
of
the
25


fiscal
year
and
an
income
statement
for
that
year.
The
reports
26


must
be
filed
with
a
state
or
federal
agency
within
120
days
27


after
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year.
Finally,
the
records
must
28


be
available
to
the
public
without
charge.
29


CURRENT
LAW
——
VOTING
TRUSTS.
A
voting
trust
is
a
special
30


arrangement
between
one
or
more
shareholders
and
a
trustee
31


(either
through
a
single
agreement
or
many
separate
agreements
32


made
between
a
number
of
shareholders
and
a
trustee)
in
which
33


the
shareholder
or
shareholders
surrenders
legal
ownership
of
34


their
respective
shares
of
common
stock
and
the
trustee
acts
35

on
their
behalf
as
a
principal
rather
than
a
proxy.
A
voting
1


trust
becomes
effective
on
the
date
the
first
shares
subject
to
2


the
trust
are
registered
in
the
trustee’s
name,
and
continues
3


for
a
term
not
to
exceed
10
years
but
which
may
be
extended
4


for
additional
terms
each
not
to
exceed
10
years
(Code
section
5


490.730).
6


CURRENT
LAW
——
SHAREHOLDER
AGREEMENTS.
The
shareholders
7


of
a
closed
corporation
(whose
stock
is
not
publicly
traded)
8


may
execute
a
shareholder
agreement
that
governs
the
exercise
9


of
the
corporate
powers
or
the
management
of
its
business
10


and
affairs
(Code
section
490.732).
This
includes
how
it
is
11


controlled;
how
distributions
are
made;
the
management
by
a
12


board
of
directors
or
offices;
the
rights
and
duties
of
its
13


shareholders,
including
voting
rights;
the
management
of
its
14


property,
assets,
and
contracts;
and
its
dissolution.
It
15


must
be
approved
or
signed
by
all
shareholders.
There
is
no
16


requirement
that
a
shareholder
agreement
be
filed
with
the
17


secretary
of
state.
Purchasers
of
shares
take
subject
to
the
18


agreement
only
if
they
are
notified
of
the
agreement
(printed
19


on
the
share
certificates
or
on
an
information
statement).
20


The
shareholder
agreement
may
be
inconsistent
with
another
21


provision
of
the
Code
chapter,
but
presumably
cannot
conflict
22


with
the
corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation.
23


CURRENT
LAW
——
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
FOR
SHAREHOLDERS.
A
24


corporation
is
required
to
prepare
and
submit
to
shareholders
25


various
financial
statements
at
the
end
of
the
corporation’s
26


fiscal
year,
including
a
balance
sheet,
an
income
statement,
27


and
a
statement
of
changes
in
shareholders’
equity.
The
28


financial
statements
are
to
be
sent
to
each
shareholder
within
29


120
days
after
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
(Code
section
30


490.1620(3)).
In
2013,
the
general
assembly
enacted
HF
469
31


(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
31)
which
allows
a
public
corporation
32


to
fulfill
these
requirements
by
delivering
or
making
the
33


financial
statements
available
in
accordance
with
rules
and
34


regulations
