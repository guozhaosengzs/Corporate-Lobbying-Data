This

Currently,
when
the
amount
of
moneys

7

fund
is
equal
to
the

allowed
by

8


the

of

between
the

for

use
tax
fund
21


from
the
economic
emergency
fund
is

22


the

increase
in
the
23


excise
taxes
on
motor

and
special

for

24


of

to

rate
of
the

26


blended

respectively,
provided
the
amount
transferred
from
the

emergency

to
the
road
use
tax
fund
for
the
fiscal
year
2


ending
during
the
immediately
preceding
calendar
year
equals
3


$220
million.
Beginning
January
1,
2015,
and
each
January
4


1
thereafter,
if
the
amount
transferred
for
the
fiscal
year
5


ending
during
the
immediately
preceding
calendar
year
is
less
6


than
$220
million,
the
excise
taxes
on
motor
fuel
and
special
7


fuel
for
diesel
engines
of
motor
vehicles
will
be
temporarily
8


increased
for
one
calendar
year
at
a
rate
calculated
to
reach
9


the
$220
million
target.
The
department
of
revenue
shall
10


determine
the
rate
of
the
increase
in
the
excise
taxes
by
11


calculating
the
difference
between
$220
million
and
the
actual
12


amount
transferred,
dividing
the
difference
by
the
number
of
13


gallons
of
motor
fuel
and
special
fuel
for
diesel
engines
of
14


motor
vehicles
distributed
in
the
state
during
the
fiscal
year
15


ending
during
the
immediately
preceding
calendar
year,
and
16


rounding
that
result
to
the
nearest
one-half
cent.
The
bill
17


specifies
that
aviation
gasoline
is
not
to
be
included
for
18


purposes
of
calculating
the
number
of
gallons
of
motor
fuel
19


distributed.
By
operation
of
law,
the
rate
determined
under
20


the
bill
for
motor
fuel
is
also
the
rate
for
special
fuel
that
21


is
not
for
diesel
engines
of
motor
vehicles
or
for
aircraft,
22


and
under
specified
circumstances,
the
rate
determined
under
23


the
bill
for
motor
fuel
may
also
be
the
rate
for
E-85
gasoline.
24


The
bill
requires
the
director
of
revenue
to
have
an
advisory
25


notice
published
in
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
and
in
a
26


newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
the
state
by
December
15
27


annually
stating
the
rate
of
the
taxes
on

special

fuel
for
diesel
engines
of
motor
vehicles,
and
other
affected
29


fuels
to
be
in
effect
the
following
January

30


Pursuant
to
current

when
the

motor
fuel,
ethanol
blended
gasoline,
undyed
special

by
more
