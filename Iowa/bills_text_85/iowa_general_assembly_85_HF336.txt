This

bill,
one
irrevocable

the

Several
17


requirements
must

capital
stock

of
a
qualified
corporation.
First,
the
stock
19


must
be
either
voting

nonvoting,
common
or
preferred
20


stock.
Stock
rights,
stock

debt
21


securities

Second,
the
corporation
that
issued
22


the
stock
must
be

existence
and
actively
doing
business
23


in
Iowa
for
at
least
10
years.
A
corporation
that
is
part
24


of
an
affiliated
group
will
qualify
if
the
affiliated
group
25


includes
a
member
that
has
been
in
existence
and
actively
doing
26


business
in
Iowa
for
at

10

27


that

the
employee-owner
on
account
of
employment
30


with
the
corporation

by
the
corporation.
A
31


corporation
will
qualify
if
it
is
a
party
to
a
reorganization
32


that
was
entirely
or
substantially
tax
free
as
long
as
the
33


reorganization

or
after
the
employee-owner’s
34


employment.

7


of
the
employee-owner’s
spouse
or

The

employee-owner
on

meets
all
the
requirements
for
an
election,
an
employee-owner
13


dies
without

an
election,
the
surviving
spouse,
or
if
14


there
is
no
surviving
spouse,
the
oldest
surviving
lineal
15


descendant
may
make
the
election.
16


An
election
is
made
by
including
a
written
