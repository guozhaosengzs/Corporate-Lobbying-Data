Sec.

Section
915.92,
Code

is
amended
to
read
as
4


follows:
5


915.92
Right
of
action
against
perpetrator
——
subrogation.
6


1.


A
right
of
legal
action
by
the
victim
against
a
person
7


who
has
committed
a
crime
is
not
lost
as
a
consequence
of
8


a
person
receiving
compensation
under
the
crime
victim
9


compensation
program.
If
a
person
receiving
compensation
10


under
the
program
seeks
indemnification
which
would
reduce
the
11


compensation
under
section
915.87,
subsection
1
,
the
department
12


is
subrogated
to
the
recovery
to
the
extent
of
payments
by
the
13


department
to
or
on
behalf
of
the
person.
The
department
has
14


a
right
of
legal
action
against
a
person
who
has
committed
a
15


crime
resulting
in
payment
of
compensation
by
the
department
to
16


the
extent
of
the
compensation
payment.
However,
legal
action
17


by
the
department
does
not
affect
the
right
of
a
person
to
seek
18


further
relief
in
other
legal
actions.
19


2.


In
case
of
recovery,
the
court
shall
enter
judgment
for
20


distribution
of
the
proceeds
as
follows:


21


a.


A
sum
sufficient
to
repay
any
payments
actually
paid
by
22


the
victim
compensation
fund.
23


b.
A
sum
sufficient
to
repay
the
victim
for
the
damages
24


incurred
as
a
result
of
the
crime.


25


c.


The
balance,
if
any,
shall
be
paid
to
the
clerk
of
the
26


district
court
and
distributed
according
to
any
remaining
27


balances
that
remain
in
the
restitution
plan.

not
constitute
agreement
with
32


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
33


This
bill
relates
to
restitution
to
insurers
in
criminal

cases.

The
bill
changes
the
definition
of
“pecuniary
damages”
in
1


regard
to
restitution
to
be
paid
in
a
criminal
case
to
include
2


compensation
paid
to
a
victim
by
insurer.
3


The
bill
defines
“insurer”
for
purposes
of
restitution
in
4


a
criminal
case
to
mean
an
insurance
company
governed
by
the
5


provisions
of
Code
chapter
515,
518,
or
518A,
or
a
bonding
6


company
authorized
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance.
7


The
bill
specifies
that
if
a
victim
of
a
crime
has
received
8


compensation
from
an
insurer,
the
court
shall
order
restitution
9


to
be
paid
to
the
source
of
such
compensation
in
an
amount
10


which
the
source
of
such
payments
could
recover
against
the
11


offender
in
a
civil
action.
12


When
structuring
the
priority
of
payments
in
a
restitution
13


plan
under
Code
section
910.2(1),
the
bill
specifies
that
an
14


insurer
be
paid
after
the
victim,
governmental
agencies,
and
15


organizations
are
paid.
16


If
an
offender
has
fulfilled
all
of
the
conditions
of
17


probation
or
parole,
except
for
payment
to
an
insurer
under
18


the
plan
of
restitution,
or
the
sentence
has
expired
and
the
19


insurer
remains
unpaid
under
the
plan
of
restitution,
the
bill
20


requires
that
the
court
enter
a
civil
judgment
against
the
21


offender
in
favor
of
the
insurer
for
any
amount
of
restitution
22


remaining
unpaid.
Upon
entry
of
the
civil
judgment
under
the
23


bill,
the
portion
of
the
restitution
payable
to
the
insurer
24


shall
be
considered
paid
in
full
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
25


case
but
not
for
any
future
civil
proceeding.
26


Under
current
law,
damages
paid
by
an
insurer
are
27


specifically
excluded
from
the
definition
of
“pecuniary
28


damages”
and
are
not
included
in
the
restitution
plan
in
a
29


criminal
case.
30


The
bill
does
not
modify
the
right
of
an
insurer
to
seek
31


reimbursement
from
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
through
a
right
32


of
subrogation
in
the
insurance
policy
or
contract
between
the
33


insurer
and
the
victim.
34


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate

subsection

which
would

complying
with
