EXPLANATION
24


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
25


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
26


Current
Code
section
257.11(4)
provides

27


for
school
districts

or
maintain
programs

including
alternative
schools,

establishes
a
supplementary
30


weighting
of
0.0642

for
pupils

grades
one

supplementary
weighting
for
at-risk
pupils
shall,
in
addition

utilized
by

a
school
district
to
establish
or
maintain
approved
programs
3


for
returning
dropouts
and
dropout
prevention.

Under
current
law,
dropout
prevention
programs
may
be
5


funded,
in
part,
using
a
modified
supplemental
amount
6


(previously
referred
to
as
modified
allowable
growth).
Current
7


Code
section
257.41
provides
that
the
budget
of
an
approved
8


dropout
prevention
program,
after
subtracting
funds
received
9


from
other
sources
for
that
purpose,
shall
be
funded
annually

on
a
basis
of
one-fourth
or
more
from
the
district
cost
of
11


the
school
district
and
up

dropout
prevention
programs,
the
bill
15


removes
modified
supplemental
amounts
as
a
funding
source
16


for
dropout
prevention
programs
and
makes
corresponding
17


changes
to
other
provisions
of
law
relating
to
the
approval
18


and
administration
of
dropout
prevention
programs
to
reflect
19


a
school
district’s
authority
to
use
amounts
received
as
the
20


result
of
the
supplementary
weighting
for
at-risk
pupils
for
21


dropout
prevention
programs,
as
established
in
the
bill.
22


The
bill
provides
that
for
budget
years
beginning
on
or
23


after
July
1,
2015,
the
department
of
education
shall
not
24


approve
a
modified
supplemental
amount
for
a
school
district
25


for
programs
for
returning
dropouts
and
dropout
prevention
26


unless
certain
conditions
are
met
relating
to
a
decrease
in
27


funding
as
compared
to
funding
received
by
the
school
district
28


as
a
modified
supplemental
amount
for
programs
for
returning
29


dropouts
and
dropout
prevention
for
the
budget
year
beginning
