Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
and
recognizes
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
Telemedicine
services
are
those
services
that
use
3


electronic
technology
to
overcome
a
geographic
distance
4


between
patients
and
health
care
providers
for
the
purpose
of
5


intervention,
clinical
management,
or
assessing,
monitoring,
6


or
educating
patients.
7


2.
The
provision
of
telemedicine
services
results
in
8


demonstrated
cost-effectiveness,
improvements
in
disease
9


management,
and
improved
patient
outcomes
and
studies
have
10


demonstrated
significant
reductions
in
hospitalizations
and
11


otherwise
necessary
medical
care
as
a
result
of
telemedicine
12


intervention.
13


3.
Geography,
weather,
availability
of
specialists,
14


transportation,
and
other
factors
can
create
barriers
to
15


accessing
appropriate
health
care,
including
behavioral
health
16


care,
and
one
way
to
provide,
ensure,
or
enhance
access
to
17


care
given
these
barriers
is
through
the
appropriate
use
of
18


technology
to
allow
health
care
consumers
access
to
qualified
19


health
care
providers.
20


4.
There
is
a
need
in
this
state
to
embrace
efforts
that
21


will
encourage
health
insurers
and
health
care
providers
to
22


support
the
use
of
telemedicine
and
that
will
also
encourage
23


all
state
agencies
to
evaluate
and
amend
their
policies
and
24


rules
to
remove
any
regulatory
barriers
prohibiting
the
use
of
25


telemedicine
services.
