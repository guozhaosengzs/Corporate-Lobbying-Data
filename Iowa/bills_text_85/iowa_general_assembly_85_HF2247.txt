the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
competency-based
education
by
2


authorizing
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
3


schools
to
issue
credit
toward
meeting
high
school
graduation
4


requirements
to
any
student
at
any
level
who
successfully
5


completes
a
unit
of
high
school
instruction,
expanding
the
6


current
competency-based
education
grant
program,
and
making
a
7


standing
limited
appropriation
of
$1
million
per
year
for
the
8


fiscal
period
beginning
July
1,
2014,
and
ending
June
30,
2019,
9


to
the
department
of
education
for
purposes
of
developing,
10


implementing,
and
supporting
a
statewide
competency-based
11


system;
duties
the
department
is
directed
to
undertake.
12


In
2013,
the
department
was
directed
under
Code
section
13


256.24
to
establish
a
competency-based
education
grant
program
14


to
award
grants
to
not
more
than
10
school
districts.
The
15


bill
rewrites
the
Code
section
to
continue
the
grant
program
16


as
part
of
the
broader
effort
to
develop
a
statewide
system
of
17


competency-based
education
pathways.
In
addition
to
the
10
18


individual
school
districts
receiving
grants,
the
bill
allows
19


the
department
to
award
grants
to
cohorts
of
school
districts.
20


The
department
must
also
employ
at
least
two
consultants
21


full-time
to
lead
the
work
of
school
districts
receiving
22


grants.
The
consultants
must
also
work
to
create
a
framework
23


to
guide
the
statewide
implementation
of
a
competency-based
24


education
system,
and
to
assist
area
education
agencies
and
25


other
school
districts
developing
competency-based
education
26


pathways
for
students.
27


The
date
by
which
the
department
must
submit
its
final
28


report
summarizing
the
projects’
findings,
and
providing
any
29


recommendations
to
the
state
board
of
education,
the
governor,
30


and
the
general
assembly,
is
moved
back
one
year
to
January
15,
31


2020.
32


The
Code
section
is
repealed
July
1,
2020.
