DIVISION

——
LEGISLATIVE
INTENT.
The

finds
that
the
availability
of
broadband
25


access,
and

to
facilitate
that
26


access,
varies
to
a
significant
extent
from
one
area
of

27


state
to
another,
and
that
increasing
access
to
broadband
28


throughout

29


entity
or
organization,

The
bill
adds
several
1


definitions
to
the
Code
chapter
for
use
in
the
Code
chapter

and
in
related
provisions.
The
bill
defines
“broadband”
to
3


mean
a
high-speed,
high-capacity
electronic
transmission
medium
4


that
can
carry
data
signals
from
multiple

sources
by
establishing
different
bandwidth
channels
and
that
6


is
commonly
used

7


The
bill
defines
“broadband

to
mean
the
8

The

defines
15


“communications
service
provider”
to

Additionally,
the
bill
17


defines

to
mean
a
United
18


States
census
bureau
census
block
located
in
Iowa
within
which
19


communications
service
providers

or
facilitate
20


broadband
service
at
or
above
30
megabits
per
second
of

With
27


respect
to
both
definitions,
the
bill
provides
that
they
may
28


be
adjusted
by
the
office
by
rule,
and
that
the
determination
29


of
whether
the

speeds
are
being
met
shall
30


be
by
reference
to

The

to
claims
that
the
