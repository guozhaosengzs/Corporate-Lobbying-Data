10


The
bill
amends
Code
section
53.18
which

11


a
county
commissioner
of
elections
notify
a
voter
that
the
12


voter
is
allowed
the
opportunity

complete
an
affidavit,
13


if
the
affidavit
that
accompanies
the
absentee
ballot
is
14


incomplete,
within
24
hours
of
the
county
commissioner
15


receiving

to
20


a
requirement
that
precinct
election
officials
sign
the
secrecy
21


envelopes

and
other
printed
materials,
and
sell
such
27


materials
to
the
several
counties
of
the
state.
Current
law
28


requires
that
the
department
of
administrative
services
conduct
29


these
functions
at
the
direction
of
the
state
commissioner
of
30


elections.
The
bill
also
directs
general
funds
appropriated
31


for
these
purposes
to
the
state
commissioner
of
elections
32


instead
of
to
the
department
of
administrative
services.
33


In

the
provisions
of
the
2009
Military
