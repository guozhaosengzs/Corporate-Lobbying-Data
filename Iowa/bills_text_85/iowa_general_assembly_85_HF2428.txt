H.F.

following:
1


1.
There
exists
a
serious
problem
in
this
state
regarding
2


the
ability
of
nonestablished
farmers
to
acquire
agricultural
3


land
and
agricultural
improvements
and
depreciable
agricultural
4


property
in
order
to
enter
farming.
5


2.
This
barrier
to
entry
into
farming
is
conducive
to
6


consolidation
of
acreage
of
agricultural
land
with
fewer
7


individuals
resulting
in
a
grave
threat
to
the
traditional
8


family
farm.
9


3.
These
conditions
result
in
a
loss
in
population,
10


unemployment,
and
a
movement
of
persons
from
rural
communities
11


to
urban
areas
accompanied
by
added
costs
to
communities
for
12


creation
of
new
public
facilities
and
services.
13


4.
One
major
cause
of
this
condition
has
been
recurrent
14


shortages
of
funds
in
private
channels
and
the
high
interest
15


cost
of
borrowing.
16


5.
These
shortages
and
costs
have
made
the
sale
and
17


purchase
of
agricultural
land
to
beginning
farmers
a
virtual
18


impossibility
in
many
parts
of
the
state.
19


6.
The
ordinary
operations
of
private
enterprise
have
not
in
20


the
past
corrected
these
conditions.
21


7.
A
stable
supply
of
adequate
funds
for
agricultural
22


financing
is
required
to
encourage
beginning
farmers
in
23


an
orderly
and
sustained
manner
and
to
reduce
the
problems
24


described
in
this
section
.

Article
IX,
2nd
subarticle,
section
3,
of
the

requires
that,
“The

Assembly
shall
encourage,
by
all
suitable
means,
the
28


promotion
of
intellectual,
scientific,
moral,
and
agricultural
29


improvement,”
and
agricultural
improvement
and
the
public
good
30


are
served
by
a
policy
of
facilitating
access
to
capital
by
31


beginning
farmers
unable
to
obtain
capital
elsewhere
in
order
32


to
preserve,
encourage,

which

There

in

regarding
9


the
ability
of
farmers

obtain
affordable
operating
loans
for
10


reasonable
and
necessary
expenses
and
cash
flow
requirements
11


of

12


12.
Farming
is
one
of
the
principal
pursuits
of
the
13


inhabitants
of
this
state.
Many
other
industries
and
pursuits,
14


in
turn,
are
wholly
dependent
upon
farming.
15


13.
The
inability
of
farmers
to
obtain
affordable
operating
16


loans
is
conducive
to
a
general
decline
of
the
economy
in
this
17


state.
18


14.
A
serious
problem
continues
to
exist
in
this
state
19


regarding
the
ability
of
agricultural
producers
to
obtain,
20


retain,
restructure,
or
service
loans
or
other
financing
on
21


a
reasonable
and
affordable
basis
for
operating
expenses,
22


cash
flow
requirements,
and
capital
asset
acquisition
or
23


maintenance.
24


15.
Because
the
Iowa
economy
is
dependent
upon
the
25


production
and
marketing
of
agricultural
produce,
the
inability
26


of
agricultural
producers
to
obtain,
retain,
restructure,
27


or
service
loans
or
other
financing
on
a
reasonable

28


an
affordable
basis
for
operating

cash
flow
29

capital
asset
acquisition

——
2013
LEGISLATION.
In
2013,
the
85th
General
12


Assembly
enacted
HF
607
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
100)
which
13


transferred
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
agricultural
14


development
authority
organized
under
Code
chapter
175
to
IFA.
15


Code
chapter
175
establishes
a
number
of
programs
to
assist
16


farmers,
including
beginning
farmers,
to
start
or
expand
their
17


operations.
Code
chapter

and
Code

include
18


provisions
authorizing
debt
financing,
including
the
issuance
19


of

and
provides
a
framework
for
the

in
order
to
provide
21


affordable

22


GOVERNING

23


appointed

and
is
supervised
by
an

BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
REORGANIZATION.
This
bill
incorporates
28


the
provisions
of
Code
chapter
175
into
Code
chapter
16.
It
29


also
effectively
moves
provisions
within
Code
chapter
16
in
30


order
to
enhance
its
readability.
It
accomplishes
this
goal
by
31


repealing
provisions
in
the
two
Code
chapters
and
reenacting
32


the
provisions
within
Code
chapter
16,
and

The

BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
CONSOLIDATION.
The
bill
consolidates
a
10


number
of
provisions
that
were
included
in
Code
chapter
16
and
11


applicable
to
certain

or
under
Code
chapter
175,
and
12


makes
them
generally
applicable
to
all
programs
administered
13


by
the
authority
under
the
Code
chapter,
including
provisions
14


which
apply

16


BEGINNING
FARMER
TAX
CREDIT
PROGRAM.
In
2013,
the
general
17


assembly
also
enacted
HF
599
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
125)
18


which
created
a
beginning
farmer
tax
credit
program,
which
19


expanded
an
existing
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
20


and
created
a
new
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit.
On
21


December
31,
2017,
the
provisions
of
that
Act
are
repealed
22


and
the
former
version
of
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
23


tax
credit
is
to
be
restored.
The
bill
still
repeals
the
24


provisions
in
HF
599
and
restores
the
old
agricultural
assets
25


transfer
tax
credit
on
the
same
date
but
the
bill
codifies
the
26


old
tax
credit
as
part
of
its
new
subchapter
in
Code
chapter
27


16.
28


TRANSITIONAL
PROVISIONS.
The
bill
includes
a
number
of
29


transitional

that
provide
that

new
Code
chapter
16
as
it
formally
31


did
under
current
Code
chapter
16
or
repealed
Code
chapter
175.
32


EFFECTIVE
DATES.
Generally,
the
bill’s
provisions
take
