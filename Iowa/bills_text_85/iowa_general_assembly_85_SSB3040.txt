27


The

Code
chapter.
The

includes
within
the
definition
of
a
29

acquired
in
the
breach
of

by
2


which
the
personal
information
was
acquired.

Currently,
personal
information
is
defined
in
the
Code
4


chapter
to
include
an
individual’s
first
name
or
first
initial
5


and
last
name
together
with
a
financial
account
number,
credit
6


card
number,
debit

number,
or
unique
electronic
identifier
7


or

code,
in
combination
with
any
required
security
8


code,
access
code,
or
password
that
would
permit
access
to
9


an
individual’s
financial
account.
The
bill
provides
that
10


a
financial
account
number,
credit
card
number,
debit
card
11


number,
or
unique
electronic
identifier
or
routing
code
alone,
12


or
in
addition
to
any
required
security
code,
access
code,
or
13


password
that
would
permit
access
to
an
individual’s
financial
14


account,
may
be
considered
personal
information
when
combined
15


with
an
individual’s
first
name
or
first
initial
and
last
name.
16


The
bill
also
requires
a
person
subject
to
the
chapter’s
17


consumer
notification
requirements
to
notify
the
director
of
18


the
consumer
protection
division
of
the
office
of
the
attorney
19


general
prior
to
giving
the
required
notice
of
the
breach
20


of
security
to
any
consumer.
The
bill
provides
that
this
21


requirement
shall
not
be
subject
to
delay
upon
the
request
of
22


law
enforcement
personnel
otherwise
applicable
to
consumer
23


notification,

apply
regardless
of
whether
a
24


person
is
otherwise
excused

chapter’s
provisions.
Existing
penalty
provisions
regarding
26


unlawful
practice
and
damages
for
violations
of
the
consumer
27


notification
requirements
would
be
applicable
to
the
failure
28


to
provide
notice
of
a
breach
of
security
to
the
director
of
29


the
consumer
protection
division
of
