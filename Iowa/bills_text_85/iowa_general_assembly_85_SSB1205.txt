3


use
of
a

4


standards.
Current
law
provides
that
any
person
who
authorizes
5


such
an
action
is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor.
The
bill
6


adds
vehicles
otherwise
regularly

to
transport
children
7


to
those
requirements.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
8


confinement
for
no

state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
14


school
district
under
