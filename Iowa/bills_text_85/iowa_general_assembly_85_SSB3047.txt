not
constitute
agreement
with
21


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general

This

requires
the
board
of

23


to
issue
an
authorization
to
school
employees
who
are
not
24


currently
under
the
purview
of
the
board,
and
provides
that
25


the
board’s
code
of
professional
rights

responsibilities,
26


practices,
and
ethics
applies
to
any
person
who
holds
27


a

The
bill
defines
“school
employee”
to
mean
any
employee
of
a
3


school
district,
accredited
nonpublic
school,
or
area
education
4


agency.
The
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
relating
to
the
5


adoption
of
the
definition
throughout
the
Code
chapter.
6


The
bill
also
requires
the
board
to
adopt
rules
to
require
7


a
background
investigation
by
the
division
of
criminal
8


investigation
of
the
department
of
public
safety
on
any
9


applicant
for
a
license
and
any
applicant
seeking
to
renew
a
10


license.
Current
law
requires
the
background
check
only
on
11


initial
applicants
for
licensure.
The
bill
exempts
from
such
12


rules
applicants
for
a
school
employee
authorization
or
renewal
13


of
that
authorization.
14


The
bill
also
broadens
Code
language
establishing
reporting
15


and
complaint
requirements
relating
to
disciplinary
actions,
16


and
reports
of
nonrenewal
of
contract,
or
termination
or
17


resignation
of
an
employee
for
reasons
of
alleged
or
actual
18


misconduct,
by
school
districts,
schools,
and
area
education
19


agencies
and
their
administrators,
to
cover
all
school
20


employees,
not
just
licensed
employees
or
those
employees
21


currently
holding
certificates
or
authorizations.
22


The
bill
also
amends
the
definition
of
“school
employee”
23


used
for
purposes
of
the
Code
provision
that
establishes
24


criminal
penalties
for
sexual
exploitation
by
a
school
25


employee.
The
bill
broadens
the
definition
to
include
not
just
26


a
practitioner
but
any
individual
to
whom
the
board
issues
a
27


license,
certificate,
statement
of
professional
recognition,
28


or
authorization.
This
broadening
of
the
offense
of
sexual
29


exploitation
results
in
making
school
employees
subject
to
the
30


sex
offender
registry,
but
does
not
classify
the
offense
as
a
31


forcible
felony.
Under
the
bill,
a
school
employee
who
commits
32


sexual
exploitation
in
violation
of
Code
section
709.15(5)
33


commits
either
an
aggravated
