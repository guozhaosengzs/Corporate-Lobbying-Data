STATEWIDE
FIRE
AND
POLICE
RETIREMENT
SYSTEM.
1


New
Code
section
411.19
provides
for
a
state
appropriation
2


to
the
statewide
fire
and
police
retirement
system
established
3


in
Code
chapter
411
equal
to
3.79
percent
of
the
covered
4


earnable
compensation
of
the
members.
The
percentage
5


represents
the
cost
of
benefits
provided
by
Acts
of
the
6


66th
General
Assembly.
The
bill
restores
the
standing
state
7


appropriation
to
the
retirement
system
that
was
repealed
by
8


2010
Acts,
chapter
1167.
The
repealed
language
had
set
the
9


state
appropriation
based
upon
the
cost
of
benefits
provided
10


by
the
Acts
of
the
66th
General
Assembly
but
did
not
specify
a
11


percentage.
