This

and
references
to

22


(Iowa)

and
to

but
23


continues
to
direct
the
state

to
adopt
high
24


school
graduation

and
assessment
standards.
25


Provisions
directing
school
districts
to
cooperate
with
26


each
eighth
grade
student
on
a
core
curriculum
plan
to
meet
27


core
curriculum
requirements
are
amended
to
replace
“core
28


curriculum
plan”
with
“graduation
plan”
and
“core
curriculum
29


requirements”
with
“high
school
graduation
requirements”.
The
30


term
“core
content
standards”,
which

by
the
state
board,
is
replaced
32


with
the
term
“assessment

standards
33


will
remain
applicable
to
all
students
in
kindergarten
through
34


grade

in
every
