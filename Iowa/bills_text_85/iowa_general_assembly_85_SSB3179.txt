S.F.
_____


The
bill
separates
requirements
for
residents
from
1


requirements
for
nonresidents.
Pursuant
to
current
law,
the
2


owner
of
a
snowmobile
who
is
a
resident
of
this
state
is
3


required
to
register
the
snowmobile
and
obtain
a
user
permit.
4


That
requirement
is
retained
in
Code
section
321G.3.
In
5


addition,
that
Code
section
is
amended
to
provide
for
the
6


issuance
of
a
special
farm
registration
certificate
for
a
7


snowmobile
that
is
exempt
from
registration
but
is
titled.
8


The
applicant
for
the
special
farm
registration
certificate
9


is
required
to
pay
a
writing
fee
and
an
administrative
fee,
10


but
not
a
registration
fee.
The
special
farm
registration
is
11


nonexpiring,
so
long
as
the
snowmobile
retains
the
exemption
12


from
regular
registration.
13


The
bill
moves
current
requirements
and
penalty
provisions
14


for
nonresidents
into
new
Code
section
321G.4B.
Current
15


requirements
do
not
change:
A
nonresident
who
operates
16


a
snowmobile
on
public
land,
public
ice,
or
a
designated
17


snowmobile
trail
in
this
state
must
obtain
a
user
permit
in
18


this
state.
In
addition,
a
nonresident
must
either
register
19


the
snowmobile
in
this
state
or
display
a
current
registration
20


decal
or
other
evidence
of
registration
or
numbering
required
21


by
the
owner’s
state
of
residence,
if
required
by
that
state.
22


Pursuant
to
current
law,
the
penalty
for
a
violation
of
23


registration
or
user
permit
requirements
by
a
resident
or
a
24


nonresident
is
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
Within
25


30
days
after
payment
of
the
fine,
a
resident
or
nonresident
26


must
submit
proof
that
a
user
permit
and
registration,
27


if
applicable,
have
been
obtained.
A
violation
of
that
28


requirement
is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
29


The
bill
provides
that
a
snowmobile
manufactured
prior
30


to
1984
may
be
registered
as
an
antique
snowmobile
for
a
31


one-time
fee
of
$25,
which
provides
an
exemption
from
annual
32


registration
and
fee
requirements
for
that
snowmobile.
Current
33


law
allows
the
one-time
fee
registration
for
snowmobiles
that
34


are
more
than
30
years
old.

the

as
required
under
this
subsection.
The
bill
2


also
provides
that
an
antique
snowmobile
may
be
registered
with
3


only
a
signed
bill
of
sale
as
evidence
of
ownership.
4


Currently,
a
person
under
12
years
of
age
is
not
permitted
5


to
operate
a
snowmobile
on
a
designated
snowmobile
trail,
6


public
land,
or
public
ice
unless
accompanied
on
the
same
7


snowmobile
by
a
responsible
person
who
is
at
least
18
years
of
8


age,
is
experienced
in
snowmobile
operation,
and
possesses
a
9


valid
driver’s
license
or
a
snowmobile
education
certificate.
10


A
person
age
12
through
15
must
have
a
snowmobile
education
11


certificate
and
be
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
parent,
12


guardian,
or
another
adult
authorized
by
the
parent
or
guardian
13


who
is
experienced
in
snowmobile
operation
and
possesses
a
14


valid
driver’s
license
or
a
snowmobile
education
certificate.
15


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
the
person
under
12
16


years
of
age
be
accompanied
on
the
same
snowmobile,
provided
17


the
snowmobile
is
approved
for
operation
by
a
person
under
18


12
years
of
age
pursuant
to
rules
adopted
by
the
department
19


of
natural
resources.
The
direct
supervision
requirement
is
20


amended
to
apply
to
any
person
under
16
years
of
age.
21


Current
law
prohibits
a
person
under
18
years
of
age
but
22


over
the
age
of
15
from
operating
a
snowmobile
on
or
across
23


a
public
highway
without
a
snowmobile
education
certificate
24


in
the
person’s
possession.
That
provision
is
stricken,
and
25


the
bill
instead
requires
that
any
person
age
12
through
26


17
have
an
education
certificate
in
order
to
operate
a
27


snowmobile
on
a
designated
trail,
public
land,
or
public
ice
28


unless
the
person
is
accompanied
on
the
same
snowmobile
by
a
29


responsible
person
at
least
18
years
of
age
who
is
experienced
30


in
snowmobile
operation
and
possesses
a
valid
driver’s
license
31


or
a
snowmobile
education
certificate.
32


The
bill
makes
a
conforming
amendment
to
Code
section
805.8B
33


to
reflect
the
new
location
of
the
penalty
provision
for

nonresidents.
