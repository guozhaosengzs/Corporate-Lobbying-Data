BILL’S
PROVISIONS.
This
bill
reduces
from
three
to
two
13


the
number
of
hours
of
continuing
education
that
a
commercial
14


manure
service
representative
must
attend
in

of
passing
15


an
examination,
in
order
to
be
certified
by
the
department
of
16


natural
resources
(DNR).
The
continuing
education
hours
would
17


equal
the
number
of
hours
of
required
attendance
by
confinement
18


site
manure
applicators.
19


BACKGROUND.
The
provision
amended
by
the
bill
(Code
section
20


459.315)
is
part
of
the
“Animal
Agriculture
Compliance
Act”
21


(Code
section
459.101).
There
are
two
classes
of
persons
22


required
to
be
certified
in
order
to
manage
manure:
(1)
23


persons
associated
with
a
service
engaged
in
the
business
of
24


transporting,
handling,
storing,
or
applying
manure,
and
(2)
25


persons
involved
in
livestock
production
and
specifically
26


confinement
feeding
operations
who
are
engaged
in
the
27


application
of
manure
originating
from
their
operations
(see
28


Code
section
459.102
defining
a
“commercial
manure
service
29


representative”
and
“confinement
site
manure
applicator”).
30


In
both
cases,
the
person
must
either
pass
an
examination
or
31


annually
attend
a
designated
number
of
continuing
instruction
32


courses.
A
commercial
manure
service
representative
is
33


required
to
attend
three
hours
and
a
confinement
site
34


manure
applicator
is
required
to
attend
two
hours.
