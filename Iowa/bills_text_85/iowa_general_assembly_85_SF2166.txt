for
an
agricultural
purpose
10


(Code

by
the

19


(Code
section

20


CURRENT
LAW
——
FINANCES.
A
commercial
establishment
must
21


pay
a

22


for
the
issuance
or

of
a

and
the

The

establishment
fund
dedicated
for
use
by
DALS
in
administering
28


the
Code
chapter
(Code

33


onto
its
business

However,
5


all
commercial

with
a
common
6


standard
of

ensure
7


that

A

registrant
or
state
licensee
must
comply
with
DALS’
rules,
with
12


one
exception.
DALS
may
adopt

complete
a

operates
a

without
an
authorization
22


or
who
fails
to
meet
a

is
guilty
of
a
simple
23


misdemeanor.
The
department
may
provide
for
the
animals’
24


seizure
and
impoundment
and
they
may
be
sold
or
destroyed
25


(Code

BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——

dual
