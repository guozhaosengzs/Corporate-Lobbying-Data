When

Sec.
5.
Section
915.92,
Code
2013,
is
amended
to
read
as
13


follows:
14


915.92
Right
of
action
against
perpetrator
——
subrogation.
15


1.


A
right
of
legal
action
by
the
victim
against
a
person
16


who
has
committed
a
crime
is
not
lost
as
a
consequence
of
17


a
person
receiving
compensation
under
the
crime
victim
18


compensation
program.
If
a
person
receiving
compensation
19


under
the
program
seeks
indemnification
which
would
reduce
the
20


compensation
under
section
915.87,
subsection
1
,
the
department
21


is
subrogated
to
the
recovery
to
the
extent
of
payments
by
the
22


department
to
or
on
behalf
of
the
person.
The
department
has
23


a
right
of
legal
action
against
a
person
who
has
committed
a
24


crime
resulting
in
payment
of
compensation
by
the
department
to
25


the
extent
of
the
compensation
payment.
However,
legal
action
26


by
the
department
does
not
affect
the
right
of
a
person
to
seek
27


further
relief
in
other
legal
actions.
28


2.


In
case
of
recovery,
the
court
shall
enter
judgment
for
29


distribution
of
the
proceeds
as
follows:
30


a.


A
sum
sufficient
to
repay
any
payments
actually
paid
by
31


the
victim
compensation
fund.


32


b.


A
sum
sufficient
to
repay
the
victim
for
the
damages
33


incurred
as
a
result
of
the
crime.


34


c.


The
balance,
if
any,

Sec.

IMPLEMENTATION
OF
ACT.
Section
25B.2,
subsection
3


3,
shall
not
apply
to
this
Act.

EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
permits
an
insurer
to
be
part
of
a
plan
of
6


restitution
in
a
criminal
case.
7


The
bill
changes
the
definition
of
“pecuniary
damages”
in
8


regard
to
restitution
to
be
paid
in
a
criminal
case
to
include
9


compensation
paid
to
a
victim
by
insurer.
10


The
bill
specifies
that
if
a
victim
of
a
crime
has
received
11


compensation
from
an
insurer,
the
court
shall
order
restitution
12


to
be
paid
to
the
source
of
such
compensation.
13


When
structuring
the
priority
of
payments
in
a
restitution
14


plan
under
Code
section
910.2(1),
the
bill
specifies
that
an
15


insurer
be
paid
after
the
victim,
governmental
agencies,
and
16


organizations
are
paid.
17


Under
current
law,
damages
paid
by
an
insurer
are
18


specifically
excluded
from
the
definition
of
“pecuniary
19


damages”
and
are
not
included
in
the
restitution
plan
in
a
20


criminal
case.
21


The
bill
does
not
modify
the
right
of
an
insurer
to
seek
22


reimbursement
from
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
through
a
right
23


of
subrogation
in
the
insurance
policy
or
contract
between
the
24


insurer
and
the
victim.
25


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
26


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
27


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
28


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
29


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
30


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
31


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
