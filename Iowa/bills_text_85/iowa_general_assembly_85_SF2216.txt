EXPLANATION

The

This

facilities.
18


Under
current
law,
a
governmental
body
may
hold
a
closed
19


session
for
certain
reasons,
and
members
of
the
public
may
be
20


denied
access
to
the
session.
Current
law
provides
that
one
21


such
reason
is
to
discuss
patient
care
quality
and
process
22


improvement
initiatives
in
a
meeting
of
a
public
hospital
or
to
23


discuss
marketing
and
pricing
strategies
or
similar
proprietary
24


information
in
a
meeting
of
a
public
hospital,
where
public
25


disclosure
of
such
information
would
harm
such
a
hospital’s
26


competitive
position
when
no
public
purpose
would
be
served
by
27


public
disclosure.
The
bill
provides
that
such
a
hospital
may
28


also
hold
a
closed
session
to
discuss
strategic
planning.
By
29


operation
of
current
law,
the
minutes
and
the
audio
recording
30


of
a
closed
session
to
discuss
strategic
planning
shall
be
31


available
for
public
inspection
when
the
public
disclosure
32


would
no
longer
harm
the
hospital’s
competitive
position.
33


Under
current
law,
a
city
council
may
adopt
an
ordinance
34


to
provide
for
the
election
of
an
initial
three-member
board

trustees
for
a

The
bill
provides
that
a
city
council
2


may
also
adopt
an
ordinance
to
provide
for
the
election
of
an
3


initial
three-member
board
of
trustees
for
a
city
hospital
4


or
health
care
facility
to
serve
three-year
terms.
The
bill
5


further
provides
that
a
city
may
adopt
an
ordinance
to
reduce
6


the
terms
of
trustees
from
four
to
three
years
for
an
existing
7


board
of
trustees
with
three,
five,
or
seven
members.
The
bill
8


requires
that
such
an
ordinance
include
specific
provisions
9


for
the
reduction
of
terms
of
current
trustees
and
specific
10


provisions
for
the
subsequent
election
of
trustees.
