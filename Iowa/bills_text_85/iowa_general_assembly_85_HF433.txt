to
receive
a
linked
7


investment,
the
lending
institution
must
send
a
loan

The

may
negotiate
the
9


terms

the
linked

and
accept
a
certificate
of
10


deposit
from
the
lending
institution.
The
lending
institution
11


must
agree
to
loan
an

interest
more
than
4
percent
above

The
linked
investments
do
not
constitute
the
payment
of
a
19


business
debt
by
the
state
nor
do
they
pledge
the
credit
or
20


taxing
power
of
the
state.
21


The
authority
is
directed
to
adopt
rules
for
the
