Legislative
findings
and
purposes.
11


1.


The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
that
a
central
12


registry
is
required
to
provide
a
single
source
for
the
13


statewide
collection,
maintenance,
and
dissemination
of
elder
14


and
dependent
adult
abuse
information.
Such
a
registry
is
15


imperative
for
increased
effectiveness
in
dealing
with
the
16


problem
of
elder
and


dependent
adult
abuse.
The
general
17


assembly
also
finds
that
vigorous
protection
of
rights
of
18


individual
privacy
is
an
indispensable
element
of
a
fair
and
19


effective
system
of
collecting,
maintaining,
and
disseminating
20


elder
and


dependent
adult
abuse
information.
21


2.


The
purposes
of
this
section
and
sections
235B.5
to
22


235B.13
are
to
facilitate
the
identification
of
victims
or
23


potential
victims
of
elder
or
dependent
adult
abuse
by
making
24


available
a
single,
statewide
source
of
elder
and


dependent
25


adult
abuse
data;
to
facilitate
research
on
elder
and


dependent
26


adult
abuse
by
making
available
a
single,
statewide
source
of
27


elder
and
dependent
adult
abuse
data;
and
to
provide
maximum
28


safeguards
against
the
unwarranted
invasions
of
privacy
which
29


such
a
registry
might
otherwise
entail.
30


Sec.

EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
7


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
8


This
bill
expands
provisions
relating
to
dependent
adult
9


abuse
including
reporting
of
dependent
adult
abuse,
the
10


dependent
adult
abuse
registry,
and
provision
of
protective
11


services
to
be
applicable
to
elders
and
elder
abuse.
The
bill
12


defines
“elder”
to
be
a
resident
of
this
state
who
is
65
years
13


of
age
or
older.
14


The
bill
eliminates
the
restriction
of
the
definition
15


of
abuse
to
only
perpetration
of
abuse
by
caretakers
and
16


instead
provides
that
abuse
may
be
perpetrated
by
any
person
17


including
a
caretaker.
The
bill
defines
“abuse”
to
include
18


financial
exploitation
which
means
the
illegal,
unauthorized,
19


or
improper
taking
or
use
of
an
elder’s
or
dependent
adult’s
20


funds,
property,
or
assets
for
the
personal
or
pecuniary
profit
21


or
benefit
of
a
person
other
than
the
elder
or
dependent
22


adult.
Financial
exploitation
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
23


possessing
or
using
an
elder’s
or
dependent
adult’s
funds,
24


property,
or
other
assets
through
undue
influence,
harassment,
25


duress,
deception,
or
misrepresentation
for
the
profit
or
26


benefit
of
a
person
other
than
the
elder
or
dependent
adult.
27


However,
the
bill
specifically
excludes
from
the
definition
28


of
abuse,
good-faith
assistance
in
managing
the
financial
29


affairs
of
an
elder
or
dependent
adult
by
a
family
or
household
30


member
or
other
person,
undertaken
at
the
request
of
an
elder,
31


dependent
adult,
or
a
family
member,
guardian
or
conservator
32


of
an
elder
or
dependent
adult.
33


The
bill
adds
a
provision
regarding
the
making
of
a
report
34


of
suspected
elder
or
dependent
adult
abuse

appropriate

enforcement
agency.
3


The
bill
provides
other
criminal
relief
for
older
4


individuals.
5


The
bill
establishes
the
crime
of
theft
against
an
older
6


individual
which
enhances
the
penalties
for
the
existing
crime
7


of
theft
by
one
degree
based
upon
the
victim
being
an
older
8


individual.
9


The
bill
amends
the
criminal
provision
providing
for
10


additional
civil
penalties
for
consumer
frauds
against
the
11


elderly
to
apply
to
the
provision
to
consumer
frauds
against
12


older
individuals
60
years
of
age
or
older.
13


The
bill
establishes
the
crime
of
financial
exploitation
of
14


an
older
individual.
A
person
commits
financial
exploitation
15


of
an
older
individual
when
the
person
stands
in
a
position
of
16


trust
or
confidence
with
the
older
individual
and
knowingly
17


and
by
undue
influence,
deception,
coercion,
fraud,
breach
of
18


fiduciary
duty,
or
extortion,
obtains
control
over
or
otherwise
19


uses
the
benefits,
property,
resources,
belongings,
or
assets
20


of
the
older
individual.
The
criminal
penalties
range
from
a
21


serious
misdemeanor
to
a
class
“B”
felony
based
on
the
amount
22


of
benefits,
property,
resources,
belongings,
or
assets
of
the
23


older
individual
involved.
In
addition,
the
application
of
24


the
class
“B”
felony
is
adjusted
based
on
the
increased
age
of
25


the
older
individual
in
addition
to
the
value
of
the
benefits,
26


property,
resources,
belongings,
or
assets
involved.
27


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes
throughout
the
Code
to
28


provide
that
provisions
currently
applicable
to
dependent
adult
29


abuse
are
also
applicable
to
elder
abuse.
