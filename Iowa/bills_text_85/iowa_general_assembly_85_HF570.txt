This
bill
relates
to
informal
conferences
on
contested
1


citations
in
health
care
facilities
or
assisted
living
2


programs.
Currently,
the
director
of
the
department
of
3


inspections
and
appeals
(DIA)
assigns
a
representative
of
the
4


department
who
was
not
involved
in
the
contested
citation
5


to
hold
an
informal
conference
with
a
health
care
facility
6


within
10
working
days
after
receipt
of
a
request
made
by
the
7


facility
to
contest
a
citation.
The
bill
would
require
that
an
8


independent
reviewer
hold
the
informal
conference
concurrently
9


with
any
informal
dispute
resolution
required
by
federal
10


regulations
rather
than
a
representative
of
DIA.
The
bill
11


provides
that
the
independent
reviewer
must
be
an
Iowa-licensed
12


attorney
that
has
not
appeared
in
front
of
DIA
on
behalf
of
a
13


health
care
facility
in
the
past
eight
years
and
has
not
been
14


employed
by
DIA
in
the
last
eight
years.
Preference
for
the
15


position
of
independent
reviewer
is
given
to
persons
who
have
16


experience
or
training
in
geriatric
long-term
care.
17


The
bill
also
changes
the
process
for
assisted
living
18


programs
that
receive
a
regulatory
insufficiency
and
wish
to
19


contest
that
finding.
Current
law
allows
assisted
living
20


programs
to
request
an
informal
review
of
contested
regulatory
21


insufficiencies,
but
does
not
provide
for
an
exit
interview
or
22


an
informal
conference.
The
bill
removes
the
current
informal
23


review
process
and
replaces
it
with
an
exit
interview
and
24


informal
conference
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
provided
for
25


health
care
facilities,
as
amended
in
the
bill.
26


At
the
completion
of
the
informal
conference,
the
27


independent
reviewer
may
affirm,
modify,
or
dismiss
the
28


regulatory
insufficiency.
The
reviewer
must
provide
written
29


specific
reasons
for
the
decision
and
immediately
transmit
30


copies
of
the
written
statement
to
DIA
and
to
the
program.
If,
31


after
receiving
the
reviewer’s
statement,
the
program
no
longer
32


wishes
to
contest
the
decision,
the
program
shall
comply
with
33


the
payment
of
any
civil
penalty.
34


If
an
assisted
living
program
wants
to
further
contest
the
35


-5-

H.F.

independent
reviewer’s
affirmation
or
modification
of
the
1


regulatory
insufficiency,
the
program
may
do
so
pursuant
to
2


chapter
17A
for
contested
cases.
The
program
must
provide
3


DIA
with
written
notice
of
the
intent
to
formally
contest
a
4


regulatory
insufficiency
within
five
days
of
receiving
the
5


independent
reviewer’s
written
decision.
A
formal
hearing
will
6


be
conducted
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
17A
and
rules
adopted
by
7


DIA.
After
exhausting
administrative
remedies,
a
program
may
8


petition
for
judicial
review
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
17A.
9


The
bill
applies
to
an
informal
conference
requested
by
10


a
health
care
facility
under
Code
chapter
135C
on
or
after
11


January

and
to
