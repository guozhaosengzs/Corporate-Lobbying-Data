EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
provides
for
an
increase
in
the
regular
program
8


foundation
base
under
the
state
school
foundation
program.
The
9


regular
program
foundation
base
is
the
specified
percentage
10


of
the
regular
state
program
cost
per
pupil
calculation
which
11


is
paid
as
state
aid
to
school
districts,
above
and
beyond
12


the
uniform
property
tax
levy
imposed
in
Code
section
257.3.
13


Beginning
with
the
budget
year
commencing
July
1,
2013,
the
14


increase
is
phased
in
over
a
five-year
period
in
equal
annual
15


increments
of
two
and
five-tenths
percentage
points,
from
the
16


current
regular
program
foundation
base
level
of
87.5
percent
17


of
the
regular
program
state
cost
per
pupil
to
the
level
of
100
18


percent
in
the
fifth
year.
19


The
bill
provides
that
the
department
of
management’s
20


determination
of
an
adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
and
a
21


statewide
maximum
adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
rate
22


only
applies
to
budget
years
beginning
before
July
1,
2017.
23


The
bill
also
provides
that
adjusted
additional
property
tax
24


levy
aid
to
school
districts
is
only
provided
for
budget
years
25


beginning
before
July
1,
2017.
The
elimination
of
adjusted
26


additional
property
tax
levy
aid
is
the
result
of
the
regular
27


program
foundation
base
percentage
reaching
100
percent.
28


The
bill
sunsets
the
annual
appropriation
of
$24
million
for
29


adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
aid
under
Code
section
30


257.15(4)
for
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,

and

program
foundation
32


base
percentage
is

percent,
the
department
of
management
33


shall
deposit
in
the
taxpayers
trust
fund
those
remaining
funds
34


allocated
for
adjusted
additional
property
tax
levy
aid.
