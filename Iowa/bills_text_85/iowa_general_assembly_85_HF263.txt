EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
provides
for
the
registration
of
all-terrain
3


vehicles
for
operation
on
certain
Iowa
roads.
4


Code
section
321.1
defines
“all-terrain
vehicle”
as
a
motor
5


vehicle
designed
to
travel
on
three
or
more
wheels
and
designed
6


primarily
for
off-road
recreational
use.
The
definition
7


includes
off-road
utility
vehicles,
but
excludes
farm
tractors
8


or
equipment,
construction
equipment,
forestry
vehicles,
9


and
lawn
and
grounds
maintenance
vehicles.
Currently,
the
10


department
of
natural
resources
regulates
all-terrain
vehicles
11


for
purposes
of
off-road
recreational
use.
All-terrain
12


vehicles
are
not
permitted
on
Iowa
highways,
except
under
13


limited
circumstances.
14


Under
the
bill,
the
owner
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
may
15


register
the
vehicle
with
the
department
of
transportation
by
16


applying
for
a
certificate
of
title
and
registration
from
the
17


county
treasurer.
The
annual
registration
fee
is
$50.
The
18


size
of
license
plates
to
be
issued
for
all-terrain
vehicles
19


will
be
determined
by
the
department
of
transportation.
20


Because
all-terrain
vehicles
are
currently
subject
to
sales
21


tax,
the
bill
provides
that
all-terrain
vehicles
are
exempt
22


from
the
fee
for
new
registration
imposed
on
vehicles
subject
23


to
registration,
so
long
as
the
owner
has
paid
the
sales
tax
24


at
the
time
of
purchase.
Registration
with
the
department
25


of
transportation
does
not
exempt
the
owner
from
the
current
26


requirement
to
register
the
all-terrain
vehicle
with
the
27


department
of
natural
resources,
but
if
the
owner
obtains
a
28


certificate
of
title
from
the
department
of
transportation,
the
29


owner
does
not
have
to
repeat
that
process
when
registering
the
30


vehicle
with
the
department
of
natural
resources.
31


The
bill
provides
that
an
all-terrain
vehicle
registered
32


with
the
department
of
transportation
may
be
operated
on
33


secondary
roads,
but
not
on
primary
highways,
except
to
34


cross
over
a
primary
highway,
and
not
on
highways
within
the

H.F.

corporate
limits
of
a
city
except
where
all-terrain
vehicles
1


are
permitted
by
ordinance.
Under
the
bill,
a
city
may
2


authorize
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
registered
3


with
the
department
of
transportation
on
highways
under
the
4


city’s
jurisdiction
other
than
municipal
extensions
of
primary
5


highways.
6


The
bill
states
that
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
7


vehicle
on
a
highway
must
be
at
least
16
years
of
age
and
have
8


a
valid
driver’s
license
other
than
a
license
valid
only
for
9


the
operation
of
a
motorized
bicycle.
Iowa
motor
vehicle
laws
10


apply
to
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
highways
11


except
those
equipment
provisions
which
by
their
nature
can
12


have
no
practical
application.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
13


operator
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
must
carry
proof
of
motor
14


vehicle
financial
liability
coverage,
and
the
all-terrain
15


vehicle
must
meet
requirements
for
headlamps,
rear
lamps,
16


and
turn
signals.
Current
speed
limits
apply
to
all-terrain
17


vehicles
operated
on
a
highway,
except
that
an
all-terrain
18


vehicle
may
not
be
operated
at
a
speed
exceeding
45
miles
per
19


hour.
20


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
operates
an
all-terrain
21


vehicle
on
a
highway
in
violation
of
current
restrictions
22


commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
23


of
$50.
The
bill
establishes
the
same
penalty
for
a
person
24


who
operates
a
registered
all-terrain
vehicle
in
violation
of
25


minimum
age
and
licensing
requirements
or
on
a
highway
where
26


all-terrain
vehicle
operation
is
not
authorized.
27


The
bill
makes
conforming
amendments
to
Code
chapter
321I,
28


relating
to
the
regulation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
by
the
29


department
of
natural
resources
and
to
permissible
operation
on
30


city
and
county
roads
pursuant
to
that
Code
chapter.
