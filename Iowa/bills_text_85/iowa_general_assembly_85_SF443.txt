been
on
the
same
preference
items
which
were
taxed
by
the
12


other
state
or
foreign
country.
The
limitation
on
this
credit
13


shall
be
computed
according
to
the
following
formula:
The
14


total
of
preference
items
earned
outside
of
Iowa
and
taxed
15


by
another
state
or
foreign
country
shall
be
divided
by
the
16


total
of
preference
items
of
the
resident
taxpayer
of
Iowa.
In
17


computing
this
quotient,
those
items
excludable
under
section
18


422.5,
subsection
2
,
paragraph
“b”
,
subparagraph
(1),
shall
19


not
be
used
in
computing
the
preference
items.
This
quotient
20


multiplied
times
the
net
state
alternative
minimum
tax
as
21


determined
in
section
422.5,
subsection
2
,
on
the
total
of
22


preference
items
as
if
entirely
earned
in
Iowa
shall
be
the
23


maximum
tax
credit
against
the
Iowa
alternative
minimum
tax.
24


However,
the
maximum
tax
credit
will
not
be
allowed
to
the
25


extent
that
the
minimum
tax
imposed
by
the
other
state
or

is
less
than
the
maximum
tax
credit
computed

DIVISION
II
——
ALTERNATIVE
PERSONAL
NET
INCOME
TAX.
The
12


division
creates
an
alternative
personal
net
income
tax
imposed
13


at
the
election
of
the
taxpayer.
In
lieu
of
the
regular
14


personal
net
income
tax
imposed
under
Code
section
422.5,
a
15


taxpayer
may
elect
to
be
subject
to
an
alternative
personal
net
16


income
tax
as
provided
in
new
Code
sections
422.4A,
422.5A,
17


and
422.9A,
beginning
with
the
2014
tax
year.
An
election
18


must
be
made
not
later
than
the
due
date
for
filing
the
return
19


for
the
taxable
year,
including
extensions,
under
rules
to
be
20


prescribed
by
the
director.
For
married
taxpayers,
an
election
21


must
be
made
by
both
spouses
to
be
effective.
22


The
alternative
personal
net
income
tax
is
computed
using
23


three
tax
brackets.
The
first
bracket
includes
taxable
income
24


from
zero
to
$8,000.
The
second
bracket
includes
taxable
25


income
from
$8,001
to
$100,000.
The
third
bracket
includes
all
26


taxable
income
exceeding
$100,000.
The
dollar
amounts
in
each
27


of
these
three
brackets
are
indexed
for
inflation.
For
tax
28


years
beginning
in
2014,
the
tax
rates
for
each
bracket
are
1.9
29


percent,
5.2
percent,
and
6.3
percent,
respectively.
For
tax
30


years
beginning
in
2015,
and
for
each
year
thereafter,
the
tax
31


rates
for
each
bracket
are
1.9
percent,
4.8
percent,
and
6.0
32


percent,
respectively.
33


Taxpayers
electing
the
alternative
personal
net
income
tax
34


are
not
allowed
a
deduction
for
federal
income
tax
paid
or
for

other
itemized
deductions
in
computing
taxable
income
but
do
1


retain
the
ability
to
deduct
net
operating
loss.
Electing
2


taxpayers
are
allowed
a
basic
standard
deduction
equal
to
3


$3,000
for
a
single
individual,
or
a
married
individual
who
4


files
a
separate
tax
return,
or
equal
to
$6,000
for
a
married
5


couple
filing
a
joint
return,
a
surviving
spouse,
or
a
head
of
6


household.
Electing
taxpayers
are
also
allowed
an
additional
7


standard
deduction
equal
to
$2,000
for
each
dependent,
$1,000
8


if
the
taxpayer
is
age
65
or
older,
and
$1,000
if
the
taxpayer
9


is
blind.
These
standard
deduction
amounts
are
indexed
for
10


inflation.
11


In
comparison
to
the
regular
personal
net
income
tax,
the
12


alternative
personal
net
income
tax
increases
the
personal
13


exemption
credit
from
$40
to
$60
for
an
estate
or
trust,
a
14


single
person,
and
a
married
person
filing
a
separate
return,
15


from
$80
to
$120
for
a
head
of
household
or
a
married
couple
16


filing
a
joint
return,
and
from
$40
to
$60
for
each
additional
17


dependent.
The
$20
personal
exemption
credit
available
under
18


the
regular
personal
net
income
tax
for
a
taxpayer
who
is
65
19


or
older,
or
blind,
is
not
available
under
the
alternative
20


personal
net
income
tax.
21


Also
in
comparison
to
the
regular
personal
net
income
tax,
22


the
alternative
personal
net
income
tax
increases
the
filing
23


threshold
from
$13,500
to
$15,000
for
married
taxpayers
filing
24


jointly
or
separately
on
a
combined
return,
heads
of
household,
25


and
surviving
spouses,
and
from
$9,000
to
$11,000
for
all
other
26


persons.
The
filing
threshold
for
taxpayers
who
are
65
years
27


of
age
or
older
remains
unchanged
at
$32,000
and
$24,000,
28


respectively.
29


The
division
eliminates
the
alternative
minimum
tax
and
30


the
related
minimum
tax
credit
for
taxpayers
electing
the
31


alternative
personal
net
income
tax.
32


The
division
makes
several
conforming
changes
to
the
33


personal
net
income
tax
in
division
II
of
Code
chapter
422,
and
