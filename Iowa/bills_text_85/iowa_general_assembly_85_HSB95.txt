1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
Restraining
a
pregnant
woman
can
pose
undue
health
risks
3


to
the
woman
and
her
pregnancy.
4


2.
The
vast
majority
of
female
inmates
or
detainees
in
this
5


state
are
nonviolent
offenders.
6


3.
Restraining
pregnant
prison
inmates
increases
the
7


potential
for
physical
harm
from
an
accidental
trip
or
fall.
8


4.
Freedom
from
physical
restraints
is
especially
critical
9


during
labor,
delivery,
and
postpartum
recovery
after
delivery,
10


because
a
woman
often
needs
to
move
around
during
labor
and
11


recovery.
12


5.
Restraints
on
a
pregnant
woman
can
interfere
with
the
13


ability
of
medical
staff
to
appropriately
assist
in
childbirth
14


or
to
conduct
sudden
emergency
procedures.
