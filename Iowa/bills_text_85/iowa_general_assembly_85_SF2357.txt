EXPLANATION
6


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
7


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
8


This
bill
expands
the
Code
provision
that
establishes
9


the
criminal
offense
of
sexual
exploitation
to
include
10


persons
issued
a
coaching
authorization
and
provides
criminal
11


penalties.
12


The
Code
currently
defines
“school
employee”
in
Code
13


section
709.15
to
mean
a
practitioner
as
defined
in
Code
14


section
272.1.
That
provision
defines
“practitioner”
to
mean
15


an
administrator,
teacher,
or
other
licensed
professional,
16


including
an
individual
who
holds
a
statement
of
professional
17


recognition,
who
provides
educational
assistance
to
students.
18


The
bill
expands
the
definition
to
include
a
person
issued
a
19


coaching
authorization
by
the
board
of
educational
examiners.
20


This
broadening
of
the
offense
of
sexual
exploitation
21


results
in
making
such
persons
subject
to
the
sex
offender
22


registry,
but
does
not
classify
the
offense
as
a
forcible
23


felony.
Such
a
person
who
commits
sexual
exploitation
24


in
violation
of
Code
section
709.15(3)
commits
either
an
25


aggravated
misdemeanor,
which
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
26


no
more
than
two
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$625
but
not
more
27


than
$6,250;
or
a
class
“D”
felony,
which
is
punishable
by
28


confinement
for
no
more
than
five
years
and
