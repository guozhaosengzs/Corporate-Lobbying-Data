EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
relates
to
economic
development
by
modifying
the
11


innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
and
allowing
the
Iowa
12


innovation
corporation
to
establish
an
innovation
fund.
13


Under
current
law,
the
economic
development
authority
is
14


required
to
issue
nontransferable
tax
credit
certificates
15


equal
to
20
percent
of
a
taxpayer’s
equity
investment
in
an
16


innovation
fund.
The
tax
credits
available
for
issuance
are
17


under
the
aggregate
tax
credit
limit
for
certain
economic
18


development
programs
in
Code
section
15.119,
and
are
limited
to
19


a
total
of
$8
million
per
fiscal
year.
20


The
bill
modifies
the
credit
by
removing
the
credit
from
21


the
aggregate
tax
credit
limit
and
thereby
removing
the
$8
22


million
allocation
limit,
removing
the
20
percent
limitation,
23


and
specifying
that
innovation
fund
investment
tax
certificates
24


shall
be
issued
according
to
the
following
procedure.
First,
25


when
a
nonprofit
corporation
receives
binding
investment
26


commitments
to
invest
in
an
innovation
fund
it
shall
certify
27


those
amounts
to
the
economic
development
authority.
After
28


receiving
certification
of
an
amount
of
binding
investment
29


commitments,
the
economic
development
authority
shall
issue
to
30


the
nonprofit
corporation
operating
the
innovation
fund
one
or
31


more
certificates
totaling
an
amount
of
tax
credits
equal
to
50
32


percent
of
the
amount
of
the
binding
investment
commitments.
33


Certificates
are
to
be
issued
by
the
economic
development
34


authority
in
the
order

which

The
bill
provides
that
the
aggregate
amount
of
tax
credits
2


that
may
be
issued
by
the
economic
development
authority
3


shall
not
exceed
$50
million.
The
bill
makes
the
tax
credit
4


certificates
transferable
and
establishes
procedures
for
5


transferring
the
credit
to
another
person
or
entity.
A
6


nonprofit
corporation
which
receives
a
tax
credit
certificate
7


from
the
authority
shall
only
transfer
the
certificate
to
8


taxpayers
who
make
an
equity
investment
in
the
form
of
cash
in
9


an
innovation
fund
operated
by
the
nonprofit
corporation,
which
10


taxpayer
shall
receive
a
total
amount
of
tax
credits
equal
to
11


50
percent
of
the
taxpayer’s
investment
in
the
innovation
fund.
12


However,
the
nonprofit
corporations
to
which
certificates
have
13


been
issued
shall
not
transfer
an
amount
of
tax
credits
that,
14


in
the
aggregate,
exceed
$8
million
per
fiscal
year.
15


The
bill
provides
that
any
innovation
tax
credit
16


certificates
issued
by
the
authority
are
deemed
to
be
a
vested
17


right
of
the
original
holder
or
transferee
and
the
state
shall
18


not
cause
them
to
be
redeemed
in
such
