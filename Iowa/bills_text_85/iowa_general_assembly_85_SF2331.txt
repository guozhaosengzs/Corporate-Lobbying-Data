EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
relates
to
the
approval
and
imposition
of
local
20


option
taxes.
21


Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
imposition
of
local
22


option
taxes,
including
a
local
option
sales
and
services
tax.
23


Currently,
such
a
proposed
tax
is
only
presented
to
the
voters
24


of
a
whole
county
upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
signed
by
25


eligible
electors
of
the
county
equal
in
number
to
5
percent
26


of
the
persons
in
the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
preceding
27


general
election
or
upon
receipt
by
the
county
commissioner
of
28


elections
of
motions
requesting
such
submission,
adopted
by
the
29


governing
bodies
of
the
cities
located
within
the
county
or
the
30


governing
body
of
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
31


county,
representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
population
of
the
32


county.
33


The
bill
amends
the
methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
34


the
local
option
sales
and
services
tax
to
the
voters
by

S.F.

allowing
the
eligible
electors
of
individual
cities
and
the
1


unincorporated
area
of
a
county
to
file
a
petition
for
an
2


election
to
be
held
in
the
petitioning
jurisdiction
if
such
3


petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
city
or
the
4


unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
applicable,
equal
in
5


number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
the
applicable
city
6


or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
7


preceding
general
election.
8


The
bill
also
removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
9


the
local
sales
and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
10


motions
must
be
approved
by
cities
or
the
county
for
the
11


unincorporated
area,
representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
12


county’s
population.
Instead,
the
bill
allows
individual
13


cities
or
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area
to
approve
a
14


motion
for
an
election
on
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
to
15


be
held
in
only
that
jurisdiction.
16


The
bill
consequently
removes
the
requirements
related
to
17


approval
of
a
ballot
question
by
cities
that
are
contiguous
to
18


each
other
and
special
provisions
related
to
the
approval
and
19


imposition
of
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
a
city
that
is
20


located
in
more
than
one
county.
21


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
proposition
for
the
imposition
22


of
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
submitted
to
the
voters
of
23


a
city
or
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
fails
to
gain
24


approval,
it
shall
not
be
resubmitted
to
the
voters
of
that
25


jurisdiction
in
substantially
the
same
form
for
a
period
of
26


three
years
following
the
election
and
may
only
be
resubmitted
27


on
a
day
specified
in
statute
for
special
elections
of
a
city
28


or
county.
29


Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
imposition
of
a
30


local
sales
and
services
tax
at
a
rate
of
not
more
than
1
31


percent.
The
bill
requires
a
local
sales
and
services
tax,
if
32


imposed,
to
be
1
percent.
33


The
bill
also
modifies
how
local
sales
and
services
revenues
34


are
distributed
to
local
jurisdictions
within
the
county.
The

-14-

S.F.

bill
provides
that
for
each
county
where,
on
July
1,
2014,
a
1


majority
of
the
county’s
population
lives
in
an
area
of
the
2


county
where
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
is
imposed,
the
3


distribution
formula
for
local
sales
and
services
tax
revenue
4


remains
the
same
as
is
required
under
current
Code
section
5


423B.7,
which
includes
an
allocation
of
25
percent
of
each
6


county’s
account
based
on
the
pro
rata
share
of
property
tax
7


dollars
levied
during
the
three-year
period
beginning
July
1,
8


1982,
and
ending
June
30,
1985,
by
local
jurisdictions
where
9


the
local
sales
and
services
tax
is
imposed.
10


Under
the
bill,
for
each
county
where,
on
July
1,
2014,
less
11


than
a
majority
of
the
county’s
population
lives
in
an
area
of
12


the
county
where
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
is
imposed,
13


25
percent
of
each
county’s
account
shall
be
remitted
based
14


on
the
pro
rata
share
of
property
tax
dollars
levied
during
15


the
three-year
period
beginning
July
1,
2010,
and
ending
June
16


30,
2013,
by
local
jurisdictions
where
the
local
sales
and
17


services
tax
is
imposed.
The
bill
further
provides
that
on
18


July
1,
2017,
and
on
July
1
of
each
third
year
thereafter,
such
19


three-year
period
shall
be
adjusted
by
the
director
of
revenue
20


by
replacing
the
three-year
period
previously
in
effect
with
21


the

period
immediately
following

period
previously
