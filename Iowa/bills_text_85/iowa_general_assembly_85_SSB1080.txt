EXPLANATION
25


This
bill
relates
to
matters
under
the
purview
of
the
banking
26


division
of
the
department
of
commerce.
27


The
bill
amends
provisions
which
currently
prohibit
a
28


depository,
defined
as
a
bank
or
credit
union
in
which
public
29


funds
are
deposited,
from
directly
or
indirectly
paying
30


interest
to
a
public
officer
on
a
demand
deposit
of
public
31


funds,
and
prohibit
a
public
officer
from
taking
or
receiving
32


interest.
The
bill
provides
that
a
depository
may
pay
interest
33


to
a
public
officer
on
deposits
of
public
funds,
and
a

certificates

for

2


The
bill
deletes
a
provision
characterizing
a
borrowing
3


group,
for
purposes
of
loans
and
extensions
of
credit
by
a
4


state
bank,
as
including
a

and
any
legal
entity
where
5


the
interests
of
a

of
more
than
one
borrower,
or
any
6


combination
of
the
members
of
the

are
so
interrelated
7


that
they
should
be
considered
a
unit
for
the
purpose
of
8


applying
lending
limit
limitations.
9


The
bill
makes
several
similar
modifications
throughout
10


Code
chapters
533A
(relating
to
engaging
in
the
business
of
11


debt
management),
533C
(relating
to
engaging
in
the
business
12


of

the
business
of
currency
13


exchange),
and
533D
(relating
to
engaging
in
a
delayed
deposit
14


service
business).
The
bill
provides
that
the
superintendent
15


of
banking
may
authorize
applicants
and
licensees
to
be
16


licensed
through
a
nationwide
licensing
system
and
to
pay
17


the
corresponding
system
processing
fees,
and
that
the
18


superintendent
may
establish
by
rule
or
order
new
requirements
19


including
but
not
limited
to
requirements
that
applicants,
20


including
officers
and
directors
and
those
who
have
control
of
21


the
applicant,
submit
to
fingerprinting
and
criminal
history
22


checks.
The
bill
states
that
in
order
to
reduce
the
points
of
23


contact
which
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
may
have
to
24


maintain
the
superintendent
may
use
the
nationwide
licensing
25


system
as
a
channeling
agent
for
requesting
information
from
26


and
distributing
information
to
the
United
States
department
of
27


justice
or
other
governmental
agency,
or
to
or
from
any
other
28


source
so
directed
by
the
superintendent.
29


Also,
with
reference
to
Code
chapters
533A,
533C,
and
30


533D,
the
bill
provides
that
the
superintendent
may
receive
31


documents,
materials,
or
other
information,
including
otherwise
32


confidential
and
privileged
documents,

Additionally,
with

and
533D,
the

shall

17


force

19


The
bill
reduces

and

license
20


fees

The
license
fee
is
21

and
the

is
reduced
22

appraiser
members
of
the
Iowa
real
estate
appraiser
board
3


to
require

8


that

occurring
during
a

The

permits
a
member
to
serve
for
three
consecutive
terms,
11


an
increase
from
the
current

states

The
bill
14


authorizes

15


necessary

Further,
the
bill

17


may
incorporate
any

recommended
by
the

18


foundation,
or
by
a
professional

or
19


by
a
public
authority
or
organization
responsible
to
review
20


appraisals
or
for
the
oversight
of
appraisers.
This
provision
21


is
modified
to
refer
to
consideration
and
incorporation
of
any
22


standards
required
or
recommended
by
the
appraisal
foundation
23


or
by
a
federal
agency
with
regulatory
authority
over
appraisal
24


standards
or
the
certification
of
appraisers
for
federally
25


related
transactions.
26


The
bill
provides
that
uniform
appraisal
standards
shall,
27


in
addition
to
the
current
requirements,
require
compliance
28


with
the
uniform

The

also
provides
that

instead
of

Again
with

The
