EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
relates
to
the
rulemaking
process
and
more
20


generally
to
agency
decision
making.
As
it
relates
to
the
21


rulemaking
process,
the
bill
requires
that
the
preamble
22


to
proposed
rulemaking
specifically
cite
the
statute
being
23


implemented,
and
that
agencies
accept
written
material
in
an
24


electronic
format,
and
allow
persons
to
make
oral
presentations
25


on
rules
through
the
Iowa
communications
network
or
other
26


electronic
means.
27


The
bill
provides
that
an
agency
shall
not
implement
a
28


federal
statute,
regulation,
or
policy
in
a
manner
that
exceeds
29


the
specific
requirements
of
the
federal
statute,
regulation,
30


or
policy,
unless
explicitly
authorized
by
state
law.
31


As
it
relates
to
agency
decision
making
generally,
the
bill
32


requires
that
boards
and
commissions
operate
under
Robert’s
33


rules
of
order.
34


The
bill
also
relates
to
agency
action
concerning
35

professional
or

The
bill
restricts
the
1


ability
of
a
licensing
board
to
consider
a
deferred
judgment
2


when
deciding
whether
to
suspend
or
revoke
a
license
or
impose
3


some
other
licensee
discipline.
The
bill
also
generally
limits
4


offenses
which
may
be
so
considered
to
aggravated
misdemeanors
5


and
felonies.
