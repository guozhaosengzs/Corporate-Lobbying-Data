to
1


schedule
a
follow-up
visit
for
the
woman
within
14
days

5


the

appointment.
The
physician
6


is
directed
to
include
a
brief
description
of
the
follow-up
7


efforts
made,
including
the
date,
time,

10


The

requires
a

to
report

11


that
the

12


after
the
use
of
the
drug
within
three
days
of
the
event
to
13

received.
The

but
15


DPH

penalty
is
not
to
be
assessed
24


against
the
pregnant
woman
upon
whom
the
drug-induced
abortion
25


is

The

provides
that
in
addition
to
any
26


other
remedies
available
under
the
common
or
statutory
law
of
27


the
state,
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
bill
28


provides
the
basis
for
a
civil
malpractice
action
for
actual
29


and
punitive
damages,
a
professional
disciplinary
action,
or
30


recovery
by
the

for
the
wrongful

of
the

woman.
However,
civil
liability
is
not
to
be

against
32


the
pregnant
woman
upon
whom
the
drug-induced
abortion
is
33

The
bill
provides

in
any
action
the
court
may
34


allow
