This
bill
continues
to
direct
the
state
board
of
education
1


to
adopt
sets
of
academic
and
assessment
standards,
but
amends
2


the
terms
used
to
describe
the
standards
and
makes
use
of
the
3


academic
standards
by
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
4


schools
voluntary.
The
bill
directs
the
state
board
to
adopt
5


rules
to
prohibit
the
department
from
adopting
and
implementing
6


common
core
state
standards
and
from
entering
into
a
contract
7


or
memorandums
of
understanding
with
another
state
or
national
8


organization
for
the
development
or
implementation
of
statewide
9


content
or
assessment
standards
unless
the
contract
or
10


memorandum
is
presented
before
the
general
assembly.
The
11


bill
provides
that
the
rules
may
only
allow
the
department
to
12


adopt
and
implement
the
Iowa
content
and
assessment
standards
13


identified
or
developed
by
Iowa
educators.
14


The
bill
replaces
the
terms
“core
curriculum”,
“Iowa
15


core
curriculum”,
and
“Iowa
common
core”,
which
were
used
to
16


describe
the
academic
standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
17


with
the
term
“Iowa
content
standards”.
Also,
provisions
18


directing
school
districts
to
cooperate
with
each
eighth
grade
19


student
on
a
core
curriculum
plan
to
meet
core
curriculum
20


requirements
are
amended
to
replace
“core
curriculum
plan”
21


with
“graduation
plan”
and
“core
curriculum
requirements”
22


with
“high
school
graduation
requirements”.
The
term
“core
23


content
standards”,
which
was
used
to
describe
the
assessment
24


standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
is
replaced
with
the
25


term
“assessment
standards”.
The
assessment
standards
will
26


remain
applicable
to
all
students
in
kindergarten
through
27


grade
12
in
every
school
district
and
accredited
nonpublic
28


school.
Corresponding
