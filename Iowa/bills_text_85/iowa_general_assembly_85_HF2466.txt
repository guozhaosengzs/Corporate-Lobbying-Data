amended


to
read
as
follows:


2.
In
the
event
market
value
of
the
property
being
assessed


cannot
be
readily
established
in
the
foregoing
manner,
then


the
assessor
may
determine
the
value
of
the
property
using


the
other
uniform
and
recognized
appraisal
methods
including


its
productive
and
earning
capacity,
if
any,
industrial


conditions,
its
cost,
physical
and
functional
depreciation


and
obsolescence
and
replacement
cost,
and
all
other
factors


which
would
assist
in
determining
the
fair
and
reasonable


market
value
of
the
property
but
the
actual
value
shall
not


be
determined
by
use
of
only
one
such
factor.
The
following


shall
not
be
taken
into
consideration:
Special
value
or
use


value
of
the
property
to
its
present
owner,
and
the
goodwill
or


value
of
a
business

distinguished

of

property
as
property.

individuals
and
families
as
authorized
by
section
42
of
the


Internal
Revenue
Code,

and
which
section
limits


the
amount
that
the
individual
or
family
pays
for
the
rental


or
lease
of
units
in
the
property,
the
assessor
shall
,
unless


the
owner
elects
to
withdraw
the
property
from
the
assessment


procedures
for
section
42
property,
use
the
productive
and


earning
capacity
from
the
actual
rents
received
as
a
method
of


appraisal
and
shall
take
into
account
the
extent
to
which
that


use
and
limitation
reduces
the
market
value
of
the
property.


The
assessor
shall
not
consider
any
tax
credit
equity
or
other


subsidized
financing
as
income
provided
to
the
property
in


determining
the
assessed
value.
The
property
owner
shall


notify
the
assessor
when
property
is
withdrawn
from
section
42


eligibility
under
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
or
if
the
owner


elects
to
withdraw
the
property
from
the
assessment
procedures


for
section
42
property
under
this
subsection
.
The
property


shall
not
be
subject
to
section
42
assessment
procedures


for
the
assessment
year
for
which
section
42
eligibility
is


withdrawn
or
an
election
is
made


.
This
notification
must


be
provided
to
the
assessor
no
later
than
March
1
of
the


assessment
year
or
the
owner
will
be
subject
to
a
penalty
of


five
hundred
dollars
for
that
assessment
year.
The
penalty


shall
be
collected
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
manner


as
regular
property
taxes.
An
election
to
withdraw
from
the


assessment
procedures
for
section
42
property
is
irrevocable.


Property
that
is
withdrawn
from
the
assessment
procedures

for

purposes
to
assure

but
such

change


the
foregoing
means
of
determining
the

market,
taxable


and

values.
