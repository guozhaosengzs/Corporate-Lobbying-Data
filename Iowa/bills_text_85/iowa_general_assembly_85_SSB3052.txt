that

enter
into
an
agreement
concerning
the
2


training
arrangement
focused
on
meeting
the
workforce
needs
of
3


the
eligible
business.
This
training
may
occur

The
job
training
fund
currently
is
established
in
the
10


authority
in
the
workforce
development
fund
and
the
authority
11


makes
funds
available
to
the
community
colleges
each
fiscal
12


year.
The
bill
provides
that
the
job
training
fund
is
13


created
in
the
state
treasury
rather
than
within
the
workforce
14


development
fund.
The
bill
transfers
$5
million
from
the
15


workforce
development
fund
to
the
job
training
fund
rather
than
16


allocating
$4
million
for
the
purposes
of
Code
chapter
260F.
17


The
bill
also
changes
language
from
mandatory
to
permissive
18


regarding
the
requirement
of
a
match
from
all
businesses
19


participating
in
a
job
training
project
pursuant
to
Code
20


chapter
260F.
The
bill
also
states
that
40
percent
of
the
21


moneys
in
the
job
training
fund
is
allocated
for
financial
22


assistance
to
eligible
businesses
and
60
percent
of
the
23


moneys
in
the
job
training
fund
is
allocated
for
financial
24


assistance
to
apprenticeship
programs.
However,
repayments
or
25


recaptures
of
financial
assistance
to
eligible
businesses
must
26


be
allocated
for
purposes
of
providing
financial
assistance
27


for
eligible
businesses.
The
bill
provides
that
the
authority
28


may
not
expend
more
than
2
percent
of
moneys
in
the
fund
for
29


administrative
purposes.
30


In
the
job

Code
chapter,
the
bill
transfers
the
31


substance
of
the
definition
of
an
eligible
business
into
its

In
this

also

the
authority
may
8


establish
a

To
receive
10


financial

an

must
enter

bill
also
provides
what
type
12


of
financial
assistance
may
be
offered
dependent
upon
the
type

Financial

is

form

in
an
amount
equal
to
100

of
the

15


of

with

repayment
of
