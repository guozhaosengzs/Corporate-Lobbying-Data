Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
3


finds
there
is
a
need
to
improve
the
system
to
meet
the
needs
of
4


children
who
have
committed
a
delinquent
act,
have
been
abused,
5


neglected,
or
subjected
to
trauma,
or
have
other
significant
6


needs
that
put
the
safety
of
the
children
or
the
public
at
7


risk.
The
areas
for
system
improvement
include
but
are
not
8


limited
to
all
of
the
following:
9


1.
Providing
equity
in
the
services
available
for
both
the
10


male
and
female
children
involved
in
the
system.
11


2.
Providing
appropriate
safeguards
to
ensure
children
in
12


placements
are
safe
and
getting
their
needs
met.
13


3.
Ensuring
that
education
and
training
services
meet
state
14


and
federal
requirements
and
prepare
the
children
for
long-term
15


success.
16


4.
Engaging
children
in
services
after
an
out-of-home
17


placement
to
prevent
the
need
for
placement
from
reoccurring.
18


5.
Providing
an
effective
system
to
support
children
when
19


they
attain
adulthood
in
order
to
prevent
their
engagement
with
20


the
adult
criminal
justice
system.

Sec.
2.
IMPLEMENTATION.
As
the
level
of
service
for
22


juvenile
delinquent
females
provided
for
in
this
Act
does
23


not
currently
exist
in
the
state
and

a
gap
in
the
24


continuum
of
care
for
juvenile
females,
