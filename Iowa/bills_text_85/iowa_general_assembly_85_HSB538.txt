This

concerns
matters
under
the
purview
of
the
banking
2


division
of
the
department
of
commerce.
3


The
bill
modifies
provisions
in
Code
section
524.107
4


relating
to
when
a
person
doing
business
in
Iowa
may
be
5


permitted
to
use
the
words
“bank”
or
“trust”,
or
any
6


derivative,
plural,
or
compound
of
“bank”
or
“trust”,
in
7


a
manner
which
creates
the
impression
that
the
person
is
8


authorized
to
engage
in
the
business
of
banking
or
act
in
a
9


fiduciary
capacity.
Currently,

list
of
persons
10


so
authorized
includes,
among
others,
a
bank
authorized
11


pursuant
to
Code
chapter

The
bill
adds
the
provision
12


that
a
bank
authorized
by
the
laws
of
another
state
to
utilize
13


“bank”
or
“trust”
in
a
manner
tending
to
create
the
impression
14


that
the
person
is
authorized
to
engage
in
the
business
of
15


banking
or
act
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
shall
also
be
authorized
16


to
do
so
in
this
state.
The
bill
also
makes
a
conforming
change
17


to
promote
consistency
between
section
524.107,
subsections
1
18


and
2.
19


The
bill
also
makes
a
technical
correction
to
Code
section
20


544A.13,
subsection
1,
changing
a
reference
to
“provisions
of
21


this
Act”
to
“provisions
of
this
chapter”.
22


Additionally,
the
bill
repeals
Code
section
544A.21.
That
23


section
permits
specified
business
entities
to
engage
in
the
24


practice
of
architecture
in
Iowa
if
certain
requirements
are
25


met.
