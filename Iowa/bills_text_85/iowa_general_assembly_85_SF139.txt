EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
requires
that,
before
a
local
authority
may
3


use
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system,
the
local
4


authority
must
compile
a
report
showing
the
number
of
motor
5


vehicle
violations
at
the
location
where
such
a
system
is
6


intended
to
be
used
compared
to
the
total
number
of
motor
7


vehicle
violations
at
similar
locations
within
the
jurisdiction
8


of
the
local
authority.
Unless
the
report
demonstrates
that
9


the
number
of
violations
at
the
intended
location
exceeds
the
10


total
number
of
violations
at
similar
locations
by
at
least
20
11


percent,
the
local
authority
shall
not
use
an
automated
traffic
12


law
enforcement
system
at
that
location.
Before
implementing
13


the
use
of
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system,
a
local
14


authority
must
file
a
copy
of
the
required
report
with
the
15


department
of
transportation.
16


The
bill
directs
that,
from
the
civil
fines
collected
17


by
a
city
or
county
from
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
18


enforcement
systems,
the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
the
19


contractual
obligations
relating
to
the
use
of
the
systems
20


shall
be
retained
by
the
city
or
county.
Moneys
in
excess
of
21


that
amount
are
to
be
deposited
in
the
secondary
road
fund
of
22


the
county
or
the
street
construction
fund
of
the
city
to
be
23


used
for
road
construction,
maintenance,
and
repair.
24


The
bill
defines
“automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system”
25


as
a
device
working
in
conjunction
with
an
official
traffic
26


control
signal
or
device
or
a
speed-measuring
device
to
produce
27


recorded
images
of
vehicles
being
operated
in
violation
of
a
28


state
or
local
law
or
ordinance
regulating
vehicular
traffic
29


or
the
speed
of
motor
vehicles.
