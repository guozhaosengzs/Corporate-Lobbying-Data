BILL’S
PROVISIONS.
This
bill
relates
to
the
processing
22


of
milk
and
the
manufacture
of
milk
products
on
dairy
farms.
23


The
bill
provides
that
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
24


stewardship
(DALS)
cannot
regulate
the
production,
processing,
25


labeling,
or
marketing
of
cheese
produced
using
raw
milk
as
an
26


ingredient,
except
as
provided
in

bill.
The
bill
provides
27


that
a
person
may
produce,
store,
distribute,
and
sell
raw
28


milk
for
the
manufacture
of
cheese.
It
also
provides
that
the
29


person
may
store,
distribute,
or
sell
the
cheese
on
a
retail
30


or
wholesale
basis.
However,
certain

the

drug
administration
(FDA).
The
cheese
must
also
be
labeled
as
1


required
by
DALS.
The
label
cannot
promote
or
discourage
a
2


purchase.
DALS
must
establish
standards
for
the
grading
of
raw
3


milk
used
in
the
manufacture
of
cheese.
4


BACKGROUND
——
STATE
REGULATION.
DALS
regulates
dairy
farms,
5


including
the
production
and
grading
of
milk
(Code
section
6


159.6).
Generally,
statutory
provisions
and
departmental
rules
7


regulating
milk
are
based
on
uniform
regulations
referred
to
8


as
the
“Grade
‘A’
Pasteurized
Milk
Ordinance”
(Code
section
9


192.102).
Under
state
law,
food
offered
or
exposed
for
sale
10


must
be
labeled
(Code
section
191.1).
This
includes
the
11


labeling
of
milk
or
milk
products
(Code
section
191.2).
All
12


milk
must
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
grade
(Code
section
194.10)
13


and
only
grade
“A”
pasteurized
milk
and
milk
products
can
be
14


sold
to
the
final
consumer
(Code
section
192.103),
although
15


grade
“B”
milk
may
be
sold
for
manufacturing
purposes
(21
IAC
16


68.2).
All
dairy
farms
selling
grade
“A”
or
grade
“B”
milk
17


must
be
issued
a
permit
(21
IAC
68.2).
18


BACKGROUND
——
FEDERAL
REGULATION.
FDA
requires
mandatory
19


pasteurization
for
all
milk
and
milk
products
in
final
package
20


form
intended
for
human
consumption
(21
C.F.R.
§1240.61).
One
21


exception
applies
to
a
list
of
enumerated
cheeses.
A
cheese
22


included
on
the
list
may
be
manufactured
using
raw
milk
using
23


aging
as
an
alternative
process.
The
cheese
has
to
be
aged
for
24


at
least
60
days
at
a
temperature
of
not
less
than
35
degrees
25


Fahrenheit
(21
C.F.R.
pt.
133).
The
United
States
department
26


of
agriculture
has
adopted
a
similar
provision
relating
to
27


labeling
(7
C.F.R.
§58.439).
28


PENALTIES.
A
person
who
violates
the
bill’s
provisions
is
29


guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
(Code
section
189.21).
A
simple
30


misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
31


days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
32


both.
