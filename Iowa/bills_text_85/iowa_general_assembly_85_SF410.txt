EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
modifies
the
innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
8


in
Code
section
15E.52.
Under
current
law,
the
economic
9


development
authority
is
required
to
issue
nontransferable
tax
10


credit
certificates
equal
to
20
percent
of
a
taxpayer’s
equity
11


investment
in
an
innovation
fund.
A
tax
credit
may
not
be
12


redeemed
by
a
taxpayer
until
three
years
after
an
investment
13


is
made.
The
tax
credits
available
for
issuance
are
under
the
14


aggregate
tax
credit
limit
for
certain
economic
development
15


programs
in
Code
section
15.119,
and
are
limited
to
a
total
of
16


$8
million
per
fiscal
year.
17


The
bill

definition
of

18


purposes

the
innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
and,
by
19


reference,
the
innovative
business
development
programs
in
Code
20


section
15.411.
21


The
bill
modifies
the
credit
by
removing
the
requirement
22


that
a
taxpayer
wait
three
years
to
redeem
the
credit,
23


by
increasing
the
amount
of
the
credit
to
25
percent
of
a
24


taxpayer’s
equity
investment,
and
by
making
the
tax
credit
25


certificates
transferable
one
time
and
establishing
procedures
26


for
transferring
the
credit
to
another
person.
27


The
bill
provides
that
innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
28


certificates
issued
by
the
authority
cannot
pledge
the
credit
29


of
the
state
and
shall
not
constitute
a
contract
binding
the
30


state
if
a
certificate
is
pledged
to
secure
the
debt
of
the
31


original
holder
or
a
transferee.
32


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment
and
applies
33


retroactively
to
January
1,
2013,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
34


or
after
that
date
and
