Code
sections
435.24
(mobile
and
manufactured
homes)
and
1


445.36A.
This
bill
requires
county
treasurers
to
accept
2


partial
payments
and
requires
the
implementation
of
a
payment
3


system
or
modification
of
the
current
system
to
accept
monthly
4


payments
of
current
year
taxes,
including
payments
using
5


automatic
direct
withdrawal
from
a
taxpayer’s
bank
account
if
6


authorized
in
writing
by
the
taxpayer.
7


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
8


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
9


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
10


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
11


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
12


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
13


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
14


This
bill
applies
to
property
taxes
due
and
payable
in
fiscal
15


years
beginning
on
or
after
July
