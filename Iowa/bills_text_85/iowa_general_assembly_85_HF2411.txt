The

3


defines
“loan”,

and
“reserve
account
or
fund”.
4


The
bill
requires
that
such
loans
not
cause
the
balances
5


of

and

The
bill
requires
that
such
loans
11


not
result
in
a

or
property
tax
increase
as
12


a
result
of
unavailability
of
surplus
funds.
The
terms
of
13


each
loan
shall
require
repayment
of
the

within
90
days

necessary
to
prevent
a

15


tax
increase.
Such
a
loan
shall
be
payable
from
the
city
debt
16


service
fund
and

statutory
debt
limitation.
18


The
full
or
partial
repayment
of
a
loan
entered
into

the

shall

20


pursuant

Code
section

The

pursuant

to
current
Code
section
384.20.
The
bill
further
provides
24


that
interest
rates
on
such
a
loan
be
set
between
the
interest
25


rate
established
for
the
deposit
of
public
funds,
established
26


in
current
Code
section
12C.6
and
the
maximum
interest
rate
27


established
for
public
obligations
and
assessments
under
28


current
Code
section
74A.6,
subsection
2.
The
bill
provides
29


that
such
a
loan
not
include
any
transfers
or
obligations
from

a

of
a

not
be

The

18


The

specifies
that
Code
chapter

unless

19


provided

is
not
to

construed
to
limit
or
otherwise
20


affect
the

and

to
the
21


eminent

authority
of
the
utilities
division
of

when

necessary
for
a
surface
drinking
water
source,
27


the
registered
professional
engineers
may,
if
appropriate,
28


employ
standards
or
guidelines
other
than
the
guidelines
of
29


the
United
States
natural
resource

The
30

requires

has
determined
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
such
1

would
not
accurately
predict
the
population
and
commercial
2


enterprise
activity
of
the
area
in
the
future.
3


The
bill
also

of
the

property
owners.
The
7


registered
professional

10


property
