EXPLANATION
16


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
17


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
18


This
bill
establishes
a
health
care
consent
authorization,
19


which
allows
a
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
of
a
minor
to
20


authorize
an
adult
person
to
exercise
certain
concurrent
21


parental
rights
and
responsibilities.
Those
parental
rights
22


and
responsibilities
are
the
power
to
consent
to
medical,
23


surgical,
dental,
developmental,
mental
health,
or
other
24


treatment
or
examination
rendered

a

and
the
power
to
exercise
parental
rights
to
obtain
records
26


and
information
with
regard
to
the
health
care
services
and
27


insurance.
The
bill
specifies
that
a
parent,
guardian,
or
28


custodian
may
only
confer
parental
rights
and
responsibilities
29


that
the
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
lawfully
possesses.
30


The
bill
requires
a
health
care
consent
authorization
to
31


be
in
writing
and
to
include
the
name
of
the
person
upon
whom
32


the
parental
rights
and
responsibilities
are
conferred,
the
33


name
and
date
of
birth
of
the
minor,
a
statement
conferring
34


the
rights,
a

prohibit
the
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
from
conferring
the
1


parental
rights
and
responsibilities,
and
a
description
of
the
2


rights
and
responsibilities
being
conferred.
The
bill
requires
3


the
written
authorization
to
be
signed
by
the
parent,
guardian,
4


or
custodian,
the
person
upon
whom
the
parental
rights
and
5


responsibilities
are
being
conferred,
and
two
witnesses.
The
6


bill
also
provides
an
example
of
the
form
of
the
health
care
7


consent
authorization.
8


The
bill
requires
physicians,
nurses,
school
nurses,
mental
9


health
professionals,
dentists,
health
care
professionals,
10


hospitals,
health
care
facilities,
mental
health
facilities,
11


and
insurance
providers
to
honor
the
health
care
consent
12


authorization.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
health
care
13


providers
and
insurance
providers
are
not
liable
when
acting
in
14


good
faith,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
on
the
health
care
consent
15


authorization.
The
bill
also
states
that
the
adult
person
upon
16


whom
the
parental
rights
and
responsibilities
are
conferred
is
17


not
liable
when
acting
in
good
faith,
as
that
term
is
defined
18


in
the
bill.
19


The
bill
provides
that
a
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
may
20


revoke
the
health
care
consent
authorization
upon
providing
21


a
written
notification
to
all
interested
parties.
The
death
22


of
the
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
effectuates
a
revocation
23


of
the
health
care
consent
authorization,
but
a
disability
24


or
incapacity
of
the
parent,
guardian,
or
custodian
is
not
a
25


revocation
of
the
health
care
consent
authorization.
26


The
bill
provides
that
an
insurer
has
the
sole
power
to
27


determine
whether
to
add
a
child
to
the
insurance
coverage
of
a
28


person
authorized
to
consent
to
that
child’s
health
care,
but
29


the
insurer
is
not
obligated
to
do
so.
