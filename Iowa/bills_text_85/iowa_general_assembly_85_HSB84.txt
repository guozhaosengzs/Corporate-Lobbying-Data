EXPLANATION
25


This
bill
strikes
language
requiring
accredited
schools
to
26


provide
at
least
180
instructional
days
in
a
school
year
and
27


specifying
what
does
and
what
does
not
constitute
instructional
28


time.
The
bill
replaces
the
language
requiring
a
180-day
29


school
calendar
with
a
requirement
that
accredited
schools
30


provide
at
least
1,080
instructional
hours
during
the
school
31


calendar
in
a
school
year.
32


The
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
schools
set
33


the
number
of
days
of
required
attendance
for
the
school
year,
34


but

districts

1


The
bill
modifies
a
provision
requiring
the
state
board
2


of
education
to
define
the
minimum
school
day.
Under
the
3


bill,
instructional
time
for
grades
1
through
12
is
still
4


exclusive
of
the
lunch
period
and
may
include
passing
time
5


between
classes,
but
parent-teacher
conferences
do
not
qualify
6


as
instructional
time.
The
bill
strikes
language
that
permits
7


a
school
or
school
district
to
record
a
day
of
school
with
8


less
than
the
minimum
instructional
hours
as
a
minimum
school
9


day
for
emergency
health
or
safety
factors
and
for
staff
10


development
opportunities.
11


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes,
including
giving
a
12


parent,
whose
child
is
under
competent
private
instruction,
13


until
September
1
to
furnish
a
report
providing
information
14


about
the
child
and
the
competent
private
instruction
to
the
15


school
district
of
residence.
The
bill
strikes
or
repeals
16


language
that
permits
the
department
of
education
to
approve
an
17


innovative
school
year
pilot
program
and
language
that
requires
18


the
department
to
establish
an
extended
year
school
grant
19


program
subject
to
an
appropriation.
20


The
bill
takes
effect
July
1,
2014.
