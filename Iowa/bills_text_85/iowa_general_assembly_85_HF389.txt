4


years
of
age
or

and
would
have
completed
twenty-two
years
5


of
service
if
the

6


be
engaged
in
a
gainful
occupation
paying
more
than
the
7


difference
between
the
member’s
net
retirement
allowance
and
8


one


two
and
one-half
times
the
current
earnable
compensation
9


of
an
active
member
at
the
same
position
on
the
salary
scale
10


within
the
member’s
rank
as
the
member
held
at
retirement,
then
11


the
amount
of
the
retirement
allowance
shall
be
reduced
to
an
12


amount
such
that
the
member’s
net
retirement

plus
the
13


amount

the

member
at
the

position
on
the
salary
scale
within

the
member’s
rank
as
the
member
held
at

Should
17


the
member’s
earning
capacity
be
later
changed,
the
amount
of
18


the
retirement
allowance
may
be
further
modified,
provided
19


that
the
new
retirement
allowance
shall
not
exceed
the
amount
20


of
the
retirement
allowance
originally
granted
adjusted
by
21


annual
readjustments
of
pensions
pursuant
to
subsection
14
of
22


this
section
nor

beneficiary,
to
equal
one

25


of
the

of
an

at
26


the
same
position
on
the
salary
scale
within
the
member’s
rank
27


as

A

restored
28


to
active

at
a
salary
less
than
the
average
final

compensation
upon

which
can
be
earned
in

shall
be
computed

in
the
same
manner
as
provided
in
subsection
14
,

,

of
this
section
for

when

abolished.
If
the
salary
scale
associated
4


with
a
member’s
rank
at
retirement
is
changed
after
the
member
5


retires,
earnable
compensation
for
purposes
of
this
section
6


shall
be
based
upon
the
salary
an
active
member
currently
7


would
receive
at
the
same
rank
and
with
seniority
equal
to
8


that
of
the

For
9


purposes
of
this
paragraph,
“net
retirement
allowance”
means
10


the
amount
determined
by
subtracting
the
amount
paid
during
the
11


previous
calendar
year
by
the
beneficiary
for
health
insurance
12


or
similar
health
care
coverage
for
the
beneficiary
and
the
13


beneficiary’s
dependents
from
the
amount
of
the
member’s
14


retirement
allowance
paid
for
that
year
pursuant
to
this
15


chapter
.
The
beneficiary
shall
submit
sufficient
documentation
16


to
the
board
of
trustees
to
permit
the
system
to
determine
the
17


member’s
net
retirement
allowance
for
the
applicable
year.

EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
concerns
the
recalculation
of
an
accidental
or
20


ordinary
disability
retirement
benefit
for
a
beneficiary
21


under
55
years
of
age
under
the
Public
Safety
Peace
Officers’
22


Retirement,
Accident,
and
Disability
system
(PORS).
The
23


bill
provides
that
a
beneficiary
shall
have
their
disability
24


retirement
benefit
reduced
equal
to
the
difference
in
income
25


the
beneficiary
is
receiving
from
other
work
and
two
and
26


one-half
times
the
amount
of
the
current
earnable
compensation
27


of
an
active
member
of
PORS
at
the
same
position
on
the
salary
28


scale
as
the
disability
beneficiary
less
the
disability
29


beneficiary’s
net
retirement
allowance.
Net
retirement
30


allowance
is
defined
as
the
disability
beneficiary’s
retirement
31


allowance
minus
certain
health
insurance
costs.
Current
law
32


reduces
the
disability
benefit
if
the
disability
beneficiary’s
33


income
from
other
employment
is
one
and
one-half
times
the
34


amount
of
an
active
member
of
PORS
minus
the
net
retirement
