be
accepted
by
the
EDA
during
an
annual
application
period
22


established
by
the
EDA.
After
an
application
is
received,
the
23


EDA
may
register
the
project
under
the
program
and
may
make
a
24


preliminary
determination
as
to
the
amount
of
tax
credit
for
25


which
an
award
recommendation
will
be
made
to
the
economic
26


development
authority
board
(board).
The
EDA
then
notifies
27


the
investor
of
successful
registration
and,
if
applicable,
28


the
amount
of
tax
credit
for
which
an
award
recommendation
29


will
be
made
to
the
board.
All
applications
that
are
part
of
30


that
annual
application
period
are
required
to
be
reviewed
and
31


scored
on
a
competitive
basis
by
the
brownfield
redevelopment
32


advisory
council
(council)
and
the
board.
In
reviewing
and
33


scoring
applications,
the
council
and
the
board
are
allowed
to
34


consider
any
factors
they
deem
appropriate
for

application
process,
including
but
not
limited
to
the
financial
1


need,
quality,
and
feasibility
of
a
project.
2


The
bill
provides
that
if
an
applicant
is
unsuccessful
in
3


receiving
a
tax
credit
award
from
the
board
during
one
annual
4


application
period,
the
applicant
may
apply
in
a
subsequent
5


annual
application
period
provided
the
applicant
submits
a
new
6


application
and
is
competitively
reviewed
and
scored
in
the
7


same
manner
as
other
applicants
in
that
annual
application
8


period.
9


The
bill
requires
a
tax
credit
application
to
include
any
10


information
deemed
necessary
by
the
board
and
the
council
to
11


appropriately
review
and
score
the
application,
in
addition
to
12


the
information
already
required
under
Iowa
law
relating
to
the
13


project’s
total
costs
and
financing
sources.
The
bill
strikes
14


language
requiring
the
EDA
to
maintain
a
wait
list
for
tax
15


credits.
16


The
bill
strikes
the
provision
requiring
that
if
a
17


redevelopment
tax
credit
recipient
has
also
applied
to
the
18


state
for
additional
financial
assistance,
the
state
shall
not
19


consider
the
receipt
of
the
tax
credit
when
considering
the
20


application
for
additional
financial
assistance
and
instead
21


provides
that
if
a
redevelopment
tax
credit
applicant
also
22


applies
to
a
federal
or
state
agency
for
additional
financial
23


assistance,
the
EDA
and
the
board
shall
consider
the
amount
24


of
funding
from
these
public
sources
when
making
a
tax
credit
25


award.
26


The
bill
amends
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit.
Under
27


current
law,
the
amount
of
the
tax
credit
is
equal
to
a
certain
28


percentage
of
the
investor’s
qualifying
investment
depending
29


on
whether
the
project
is
located
on
a
grayfield
site
or
a
30


brownfield
site
and
whether
or
not
the
project
meets
green
31


development
requirements.
The
bill
provides
that
the
amount
32


of
the
tax
credit
shall
be
an
amount
determined
by
the
board
33


in
conjunction
with
the
council,
but
shall
not
exceed
those
34


percentages
already
provided
under
current
law.

bill
35


-8-

H.F.

provides
that
the
amount
of
tax
credit
included
on
a
tax
credit
1


certificate
shall
be
contingent
on
an
award
by
the
board,
and
2


on
the
completion
of
an
audit
of
the
project
which
audit
is
3


already
required
under
Iowa
law.
4


The
bill
requires
agreements
under
the
program.
An
investor
5


awarded
tax
credits
is
required
to
enter
into
an
agreement
6


with
the
EDA
concerning
the
qualifying
redevelopment
project.
7


The
bill
amends
language
relating
to
a
taxpayer’s
loss
of
8


any
right
to
a
tax
credit
for
failure
to
comply
with
any
9


requirements,
to
specify
that
if
an
investor
fails
to
comply
10


with
any
requirements
of
the
agreement,
the
authority
may
find
11


the
investor
in
default
and
revoke
all
or
a
portion
of
the
12


tax
credit
award.
If
recovery
of
a
claimed
tax
credit
by
the
13


department
of
revenue
(DOR),
as
required
under
current
law,
14


is
necessary
for
failure
to
maintain
the
requirements
of
an
15


agreement,
the
bill
provides
that
such
recovery
shall
be
in
16


the
same
manner
as
provided
in
Code
section
15.330,
subsection
17


2,
which
relates
to
the
recovery
of
incentives
under
the
high
18


quality
jobs
program.
19


The
bill
amends
the
process
of
claiming
the
tax
credits
20


by
allowing
the
currently
nonrefundable
tax
credits
to
be
21


refundable,
but
only
to
nonprofit
organizations
under
certain
22


conditions.
In
order
for
tax
credits
to
qualify
as
refundable,
23


a
nonprofit
organization
must
be
an
investor
applying
for
24


the
tax
credits,
must
be
organized
under
Code
chapter
504,
25


must
qualify
as
a
tax-exempt
organization
under
section
26


501(c)(3)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code,
and
must
establish
27


these
requirements
during
the
tax
credit
application
process.
28


The
EDA
will
be
required
to
indicate
on
the
tax
credit
29


certificate
issued
to
these
nonprofit
organizations
that
such
30


requirements
have
been
met.
The
bill
requires
that
a
taxpayer
31


include,
rather
than
attach,
a
tax
credit
certificate
with
the
32


taxpayer’s
tax
return.
The
bill
amends
the
requirement
that
33


tax
credits
shall
not
be
claimed
for
taxable
years
beginning
34


prior
to
July
1,
2009,
to
require
that
tax
credits
shall
not

2


The
bill
strikes
Code
section
15.293A,
subsections
10
and
3


11,
relating
to
the
adoption
of
administrative
rules
by
the
4


EDA
and
the
DOR,
and
the
EDA’s
cooperation
with
the
department
5


of
natural
resources
and
local
governments
regarding
the
6


dissemination
of
information
about
the
program.
The
bill
7


requires
the
authority,
in
conjunction
with
the
department
8


of
revenue,
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
the
program.
The
9


bill
transfers
to
Code
section
15.293B
the
language
from
10


Code
section
15.293A,
subsection
8,
relating
to
the
deadline
11


for
completing
registered
projects,
and
amends
part
of
that
12


language
referencing
the
project’s
approval
date
to
instead
13


reference
the
date
upon
which
the
project
was
registered.
14


The
bill
amends
the
duties
and
powers
of
the
council
to
15


provide
that
it
may
recommend
to
the
EDA
the
amount
of
tax
16


credits
that
a
redevelopment
project
should
be
awarded,
instead
17


of
the
amount
of
tax
credits
that
a
redevelopment
project
is
18


eligible
to
receive.
19


Finally,
the
bill
removes
the
automatic
repeal
date
of
the
20


program,
which
under
current
law
is
set
to
expire
on
June
30,
21


2021.
22


The
bill
applies
to
qualifying
redevelopment
projects
for
23


which
a
redevelopment
tax
credit
is
awarded
on
or
after
the
24


effective
date
of
the
bill.
The
bill
provides
that
qualifying
25


redevelopment
projects
for
which
a
redevelopment
tax
credit
26


was
awarded
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
shall
be
27


governed
by
current
law.
