EXPLANATION
24


This
joint
resolution
proposes
an
amendment
to
the
25


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
relating
to
the
boundary
26


lines
of
counties.
The
joint
resolution
proposes
new
section
27


2
of
Article
XI,
requiring
the
general
assembly
to
reduce
the
28


aggregate
number
of
counties
to
not
more
than
50
by
statute
on
29


or
before
July
1,
2017,
unless
the
aggregate
number
of
counties
30


has
otherwise
been
reduced
to
not
more
than
50
prior
to
July
31


1,
2017.
The
joint
resolution
allows
such
reduction
to
be
32


accomplished
by
the
merger
in
whole
or
in
part
of
presently
33


existing
counties.
Newly
created
counties,
however,
must
be
34


composed
of
contiguous
territory
and
be
reasonably
compact.

The
joint
resolution
requires
the
general
assembly
to
name
1


each
new
county
created
and
to
select
the
place
for
the
seat
of
2


the
county
government
for
each
new
county
created.
The
joint
3


resolution
allows
the
general
assembly
to
authorize
the
newly
4


created
counties
to
create
offices
of
county
government
as
a
5


county
deems
reasonable
and
necessary.
The
joint
resolution
6


requires
the
general
assembly
to
enact
all
laws
necessary
to
7


effectuate
new
section
2
of
Article
XI
of
the
Constitution
of
8


the
State
of
Iowa.
9


The
joint
resolution
provides
that
in
the
event
the
general
10


assembly
fails
to
reduce
the
number
of
counties,
select
a
11


county
seat
of
government
for
each
newly
created
county,
12


and
name
each
newly
created
county
as
required,
the
chief
13


justice
of
the
supreme
court
is
required
to
do
so.
The
joint
14


resolution
also
provides
that
after
the
reduction
in
the
number
15


of
counties
has
been
effectuated,
the
number
and
boundaries
of
16


such
newly
created
counties
may
not
be
changed.
17


The
joint
resolution
repeals
provisions
requiring
any
law
18


that
changes
boundary
lines
of
a
county
to
first
be
approved
19


at
a
general
election
by
the
people
of
the
counties
affected
20


by
the
change.
21


The
joint
resolution
proposes
a
corresponding
amendment
to
22


section
8
of
Article
XI
of
the
Constitution
of
the
State
of
23


Iowa,
which
establishes
the
city
of
Des
Moines
in
Polk
county
24


as
the
seat
of
government
and
establishes
the
state
university
25


at
Iowa
City
in
Johnson
county,
by
removing
the
references
to
26


Polk
county
and
Johnson
county.
27


The
resolution,
if
adopted,
would
be
referred
to
the
next
28


general
assembly
(Eighty-sixth)
for
adoption
before
being
29


submitted
to
the
electorate
for
ratification.
