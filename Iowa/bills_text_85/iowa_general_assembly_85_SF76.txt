shall

A
review
by
the

court
of
a
judgment

sentence
13


imposing
the
punishment
of
death
has
priority
over
all
other

actions
pending
before

court.

The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
and
judgment,
16


and

separately
review
the

proceeding.
Upon
17


determining
that
errors
did
not
occur
at
the
trial
requiring
18


reversal
or
modification
of
the
judgment,
the
supreme
court
19


shall
proceed
to
determine
if
the
sentence
of
death
is
lawfully
20


imposed.
In
its
review
of
the
sentencing
proceeding
the
21


supreme
court
shall
determine
all
of
the
following:
22


a.
Whether
the
sentence
of
death
was
imposed
capriciously
or
23


under
the
influence
of
prejudice
or
other
arbitrary
factor.
24


b.
Whether
the
special
verdicts
returned
under
section
25


901.11
are
supported
by
the
evidence.
26


c.
Whether
the
sentence
of
death
is
excessive
or
27


disproportionate
to
the
penalty
imposed
in
similar
cases,
28


considering
both
the
crime
and
the
defendant.

If
the
supreme
court
determines
that
the
sentence
of
30


death
was
not
lawfully
imposed,
the
court
shall
set
aside
the

sentence
and
shall
remand
the
case
to
the

for
a

14


to

the
defendant
at
the

of
the
murder.
25


(3)

26


of
the

requirements
of
law
was
significantly
impaired
as
a
result
of
a
28


mental
disease
or

intellectual
disability,
but
not
to
29


a
degree
sufficient
to
constitute
a
defense.
30


(4)
The
defendant
has
no
significant
history
of
prior
adult
31


criminal
activity.
32


(5)

any

Whether
the

shall
be
sentenced
to
death.
23


6.
A
recommendation
for
a
sentence
of
death
shall
not
be
24


permitted

the
race,
color,
25


religious
beliefs,
national
origin,
or

of
the
defendant
26


or
of
any
victim.
After

prior
27


to
the
return
of
a

proceeding,
if
28


the
matter
is
tried
before

EXPLANATION
30


This
bill
amends
the
Iowa
criminal
code
to
provide
for
31


punishment
by
death
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
and
either
32


kidnapping
in
the
first
degree,
or
sexual
abuse
in
the
first
33


degree,
or
both,
committed
with
respect
to
the
same
victim
34


who
is
a
minor
if
the
trial
jury,
or
the
judge
if

is
no
jury,
makes
specific
findings
and
whether
the
jury
1


believes
the
defendant
should
be
put
to
death
in
a
separate
2


penalty
proceeding
held
after
the
close
of
the
initial
trial
3


proceeding.
Under
the
bill,
a
death
sentence
could
be
imposed
4


if
the
murder
would
constitute
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
5


the
state
pleads
and
proves
the
defendant
committed
either
6


kidnaping
in
the
first
degree
or
sexual
abuse
in
the
first
7


degree,
or
both,
against
the
murder
victim
who
was
a
minor.
8


If
a
person
is
indigent
and
is
charged
with
capital
murder,
9


payment
of
costs
for
two
attorneys
is
authorized.
The
supreme
10


court
is
required
to
establish
standards
for
the
competency
of
11


counsel
in
death
penalty
cases.
The
state
public
defender
is
12


charged
with
establishing
teams
of
qualified
lead
and
cocounsel
13


for
death
penalty
cases,
as
well
as
conducting
or
sponsoring
14


specialized
training
programs
for
attorneys
representing
15


persons
who
may
be
executed.
16


If
such
a
case
proceeds
to
trial
and
a
notice
of
intent
to
17


seek
the
death
penalty
has
been
filed,
in
addition
to
any
other
18


defenses
which
may
be
presented
to
the
charge,
the
defendant
19


may
raise
the
issue
of
intellectual
disability
during
the
time
20


of
filing
pretrial
motions,
and
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
21


a
rebuttable
presumption
of
intellectual
disability
if
the
22


defendant
establishes
that
the
defendant
has
an
intelligence
23


quotient
of
70
or
below.
24


Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
25


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
26


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the
27


race,
color,
religious
beliefs,
national
origin,
or
sex
of
28


the
defendant
or
of
any
victim
is
not
to
be
considered.
The
29


supreme
court
shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
30


death
sentences
imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
31


imposed
under
the
influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
32


available
to
litigants.
33


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
34


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to

a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
1


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
a
2


reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances
that
3


may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
sentenced
4


to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
consider
5


include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
influence
6


of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
age
of
7


the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
the
8


wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
not
9


to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
no
10


significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
under
11


extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
the
12


murder,
and
either
the
kidnapping
or
sexual
abuse,
or
both;
and
13


the
defendant’s
character
or
record
or
the
circumstances
of
the
14


offense.
The
sentencing
proceeding
is
conducted
separately
15


from
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
same
trier
of
16


fact.
17


For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
18


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
19


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
20


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
21


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
22


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.
Evidence
of
certain
23


juvenile
delinquency
adjudications
is
not
admissible
in
any
24


proceeding
to
determine
the
sentence.
If
the
jury
fails
to
25


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
26


penalty
would
be
life
imprisonment.
27


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
28


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
29


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
30


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
31


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
32


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
33


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
34


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the

court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
1


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
2


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
3


witnessing
of
executions.
4


The
bill
further
provides
that
in
order
to
receive
a
sentence
5


of
death,
the
defendant
must
be
at
least
18
years
of
age
at
6


the
time
the
offense
is
committed,
must
not
be
mentally
ill
or
7


intellectually
disabled,
and
must
have
been
a
major
participant
8


in
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
must
have
shown
a
manifest
9


indifference
to
human
life.
10


A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
11


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
12


the
person
is
no
longer
pregnant.
A
procedure
is
also
provided
13


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane
14


after
conviction
but
before
execution.
15


An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or
16


assist
in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
17


for
refusing
to
participate.
18


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
19


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
20


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
21


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
22


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
23


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
24


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
25


The
bill
contains
severability
provisions
and
takes
effect
26


January
1,
2014,
and
applies
only
to
offenses
committed
on
or
27


after
that
date.
