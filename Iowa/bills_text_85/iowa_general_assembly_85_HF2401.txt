filing

three
different

of
Code
14


section
175.37:
(1)
a
tax
credit
which
was
first
claimed
in
a
15


tax
year
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2009,
and
ending
by

section
175.37
for
22


the

the
section
may
23

the
extended
10-year

apply
to
a

credit
27


first
claimed
in
a
tax
year
beginning
on
or
after
January
28


1,
2013,
and
ending
by

The
taxpayer
may
29


continue
to
use
any
remaining
amount
of
the

in
30


future
tax
years,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
credit
is
31


to
be
eliminated
on

32


BILL’S

The

Code
section

a
taxpayer
who
5

the
same
tax
credit

the
second
version
of
Code
6


section
175.37.
It

7

10


taxpayer
who
will
claim
a
tax
credit
under
the
third

of
11


the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit.
Those

15


BACKGROUND.
In
2006,
the
general
assembly
enacted
SF
2268
16


(2006
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161)
establishing
an
agricultural
17


assets
transfer
tax
credit,
administered
by
the
agricultural
18


development
authority,
to
assist
beginning
farmers
to
acquire
19


agricultural
assets
by
lease
or
rental
arrangements.
In
2013,
20


the
general
assembly
enacted
HF
599
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
21


125),
creating
the
program
which
included
the
second
version
22


of
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
the
new
23


custom
farming
contract
tax
credit.
HF
599
also
increased
from
24


$6
million
to
$12
million
the
ceiling
limit
used
to
support
25


the
program
through
the
issuance
of
tax
credit
certificates
26


(Code
section
175.39).
The
program
and
the
dollar
amount
27


limit
applied
retroactively
to
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
28


January
1,
2013,
and
is
to
expire
on
December
31,
2017.
The
29


Code
editor
is
directed
to
codify
the
third
version
of
the
Code
30


section
by
restoring
the
tax
credit
with
its
$6
million
ceiling
31


limit
to
that
existing
immediately
prior
to
the
enactment
32


of
HF
599.
The
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit
is
to
be
33


eliminated
on
that
same
date.
