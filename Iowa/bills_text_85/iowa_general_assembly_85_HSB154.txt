in
which
attachment
under
chapter

17


is
sought
upon
any
of
the
grounds
specified
in
section
639.3,
18


subsections
3
to
12
.

the

the
amount
stated
in
the

notice
of
right
to
cure,
whichever

by
tendering
any
27


performance

than

in
default
is
a
credit

been
closed,
the


act
of
curing
a

31


restores
to
the
consumer
the

EXPLANATION
14


This
bill
specifies
notice
of
right
to
cure
provisions
15


applicable
to
a
credit
card
account
that
has
been
closed.
16


The
bill
provides
notice
of
right
to
cure
provisions
17


contained
in
new
Code
section
537.5112
that
will
apply
to
18


closed
credit
card
accounts,
which
are
similar
to
general
19


notice
of
right
to
cure
provisions
contained
in
Code
section
20


537.5111
requiring
a
creditor
to
provide
specified
information
21


to
a
consumer
in
a
specified
format
in
connection
with
a
credit
22


transaction
in
default.
23


The
new
Code
section
differs
from
the
general
provisions
24


in
requiring
the
notice
to
include
an
itemization
of
any
25


attorney
fees
applicable
to
the
defaulted
account,
and
by
26


providing
a
statement
that
if
the
creditor
arranges
for
27


installment
payments
with
the
consumer
to
satisfy
the
debt
28


and
the
consumer
defaults
on
one
or
more
of
the
installment
29


payments
within
the
next
year,
the
creditor
may
exercise
their
30


rights
without
sending
the
consumer
another
notice
of
right
to
31


cure.
Additionally,
the
notice
states
that
if
the
consumer
has
32


questions,
the
consumer
should
write
or
telephone
the
creditor
33


promptly.
34


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes
reflecting
the
distinction
