the
12


amount

withdrawal
from
an
account
that
was
made
for
purposes
13


other
than
eligible
costs
of
the
account
holder

the
extent
14


it
was

the

whichever

first,
19


shall
be
considered
a
withdrawal
that
must
be
added
to
net
20


income
to
the
extent
it
was
previously
subtracted.
However,
21


amounts

claim,
statement,
or
billing
27


to
justify
the
withdrawal
of
money
from
a
first-time
homebuyer
28


savings
account.
A
serious
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
29


confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
of
at
least
30


$315
but
not
more

33


administer
