EXPLANATION
20


BACKGROUND.
Generally,
this
Act
amends
provisions
which
21


relate
to
business
entities
that
are
formed
under
the
laws
22


of
this
state
or
organized
under
the
laws
of
a
different
23


state,
and
allowed
to
do
business
in
this
state,
by
filing
24


certain
documents
with
the
secretary
of
state
and
conducting
25


operations
in
a
manner
consistent
with
those
laws.
In
the
case
26


of
a
domestic
entity,
the
secretary
of
state
recognizes
its
27


existence
and
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
entity,
the
secretary
28


of
state
authorizes
its
right
to
do
business
in
this
state.
29


Each
of
the
various
types
of
business
entities
is
governed
by
a
30


separate
Code
chapter,
often
derived
from
legislation
proposed
31


by
national
organizations
such
as
uniform
acts
by
the
national
32


conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
including
33

and

the
revised
uniform

company
Act
herein
2


referred
to
as
“RULLCA”
(Code
chapter
489).
Alternatively,
3


several
Code
chapters
derive
from
model
legislation
proposed

by
the
American
bar
association
including
the
Iowa
business
5


corporation
Act
herein
referred
to
as

6


and
the
revised
Iowa
nonprofit
corporation
Act
herein
referred
7


to
as
“RINCA”
(Code
chapter
504).
Iowa
uniquely
includes
a
8


number
of
Code
chapters
governing
cooperative
associations,
9


sometimes
simply
known
as
cooperatives,
including
those
herein
10


referred
to
as
traditional
cooperatives
(Code
chapter
499)
or
11


closed
cooperatives
(Code
chapter
501).
Iowa
also
recognizes
12


a
type
of
cooperative,
a
cooperative-corporation,
under
the
13


Iowa
cooperative
associations
Act
herein
referred
to
as
“ICAA”
14


which
in
some
form
has
been
enacted
in
other
states
(Code
15


chapter
501A).
A
special
chapter
governs
multiple
housing
16


organizations
organized
on
a
cooperative
basis
(Code
chapter
17


499A).
Notwithstanding
that
these
chapters
originate
from
18


different
sources,
their
provisions
are
often
very
similar.

REQUIREMENTS.
The
bill
amends
20


provisions
in
all
the
Code
chapters
listed
above,
which
include
21


provisions
affecting
organizations
under
the
UPA,
ULPA,
RULLCA,
22


IBCA,
and
RINCA;
as
well
as
the
listed
cooperatives.
The
Code
23


chapters
currently
all
require
a
business
entity
to
provide
an
24


address
in
certain
circumstances,
which
is
sometimes
specified
25


as
a
street
address,
mailing
address,
or
post
office
address;
26


but
which
is
more
often
not
specified.
The
bill
provides
27


that
the
address
is
always
limited
to
a
street
address.
The
28


provisions
refer
to
addresses
of
persons
involved
in
managing
29


or
participating
in
the
business
entity,
investing
in
the
30


entity,
or
representing
the
entity.
For
example,
in
the
31


case
of
a
corporation
under
the
IBCA,
the
bill’s
amendments
32


would
affect
a

of
state
to
10


file
a
record
of
a
statement
of
dissociation
or
statement
11


of
withdrawal
when
the
partnership
is
to
be
dissolved
(Code
12


section
488.206).
The
RULLCA
requires
the
secretary
of
state
13


to
file
a
record
of
a
statement
of
denial
by
a
person
who
14


objects
to
authority
conferred
upon
that
person
by
a
limited
15


liability
company
(Code
section
489.205).
In
both
cases
the
16


bill
provides
that
the
secretary
of
state
shall
only
send
a
17


copy
of
the
filed
statement
and
fees
received
to
the
person
on
18


whose
behalf
the
record
was
filed.
In
the
case
of
the
ULPA,
19


the
secretary
of
state
is
no
longer
required
to
send
a
copy
20


of
the
filed
statement
and
receipt
of
the
fee
to
the
limited
21


partnership.
In
the
case
of
the
RULLCA,
the
secretary
of
state
22


is
no
longer
required
to
send
a
copy
of
the
record
and
receipt
23


of
a
fee
to
the
limited
liability
company.
In
both
cases,
the
24


secretary
of
state
is
no
longer
required
to
send
the
requestor
25


a
certified
copy
of
the
record.

DIVISION
III
——
PROOF
OF
EXISTENCE
OR
AUTHORIZATION.
The
27


bill
amends
the
ULPA,
RULLCA,
IBCA,
ICAA,
and
RINCA
Code
28


chapters.
Specifically,
each
Code
chapter
requires
the
29


secretary
of
state
to
issue
a
certificate
of
existence
to
30


a
domestic
business
entity
or
a
certificate
of
authority
31


(sometimes
referred
to
as
a
certificate
of
authorization)
to
32


a
foreign
entity.
The
certificate
is
conclusive
evidence
of
33


the
entity’s
status
(that
a
domestic
entity
exists
or
that
a
34


foreign
entity
is
authorized
to
do
business
in
this
state).

To
a
great
extent,
the
similar
provisions
in
the
two
uniform
1


Acts
(the
ULPA
and
the
RULLCA)
are
amended
to
conform
with
the
2


provisions
in
the
IBCA.
The
other
Code
chapters
(the
ICAA
and
3


the
RINCA)
are
also
amended,
although
their
provisions
more
4


closely
resemble
the
IBCA.
5


In
the
case
of
the
ULPA
and
the
RULLCA,
a
certificate
must
6


still
include
the
entity’s
name,
state
that
all
fees
and
7


penalties
due
the
secretary
of
state
have
been
paid,
state
8


that
the
entity
filed
its
most
recent
biennial
report
with
the
9


secretary
of
state,
and
allow
for
other
information
required
by
10


the
secretary
of
state.
For
a
domestic
entity,
the
certificate
11


must
still
state
that
the
entity
is
duly
formed
under
state
12


law
and,
for
a
foreign
entity,
it
must
still
state
that
the
13


entity
is
authorized
to
transact
business
in
this
state.
For
14


a
domestic
entity,
it
must
state
that
the
secretary
of
state
15


has
not
filed
a
statement
of
dissolution
or
termination.
For
a
16


foreign
entity,
a
certificate
is
no
longer
required
to
state
17


that
the
certificate
of
authority
has
not
been
revoked.

DIVISION
IV
——
AMENDED
CERTIFICATES
OF
AUTHORITY.
The
bill
19


amends
the
ULPA,
RULLCA,
IBCA,
ICAA,
and
RINCA
Code
chapters.
20


In
each
case
a
similar
provision
allows
a
foreign
business
21


entity
to
apply
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
purposes
of
22


amending
its
certificate
of
authority.
The
bill
amends
each
23


Code
chapter
in
the
same
way
by
adding
a
provision
which
allows
24


the
foreign
business
entity
to
obtain
an
amended
certificate
of
25


authority
from
the
secretary
of
state.
26


DIVISION
V
——
BIENNIAL
REPORTS.
The
bill
amends
the
27


ULPA,
RULLCA,
IBCA,
and
RINCA
Code
chapters
as
well
as
the
28


Code
chapters
governing
traditional
cooperatives,
closed
29


cooperatives,
and
cooperative
corporations.
The
Code
chapter
30


governing
traditional
cooperatives
includes
Code
section
31


499.49,
which
adopts
the
IBCA
reporting
requirements
by
32


reference.
The
bill
expressly
amends
the
Code
chapters
33


governing
closed
cooperatives
and
corporation-cooperatives
34


which
include
similar
reporting
requirements.

provisions
establishing
biennial
reporting
are
unique
to
1


Iowa.
(See
1997
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
171,
which
amends
the
IBCA
by
2


replacing
annual
reporting
requirements
with
biennial
reporting
3


requirements
and
makes
similar
changes
in
other
Code
chapters
4


governing
partnerships
and
cooperatives.)
The
bill
amends
all
5


these
Code
chapters
by
harmonizing
language
(e.g.,
changing
6


the
term
“sets
forth”
to
“includes”).
In
addition,
it
makes
7


substantive
changes
to
each
relevant
Code
section.
The
bill
8


provides
that
a
biennial
report
must
include
the
domestic
9


entity’s
name
as
it
appears
in
its
certificate
of
existence
10


and
the
foreign
entity’s
name
as
used
in
its
certificate
of
11


authority.
It
qualifies
the
address
information
of
persons
12


connected
with
the
entity
to
require
the
street
address.
For
13


example,
in
the
case
of
an
entity
under
the
IBCA,
the
report
14


must
include
the
street
address
of
its
registered
office
and
15


registered
agent,
its
principal
office,
and
its
officers.
The
16


bill
also
requires
a
report
of
a
foreign
entity
to
include
17


the
state
or
other
jurisdiction
in
which
the
entity
was
18


formed
(e.g.,
incorporated),
and
it
requires
that
the
report
19


be
current
as
of
the
date
that
it
is
executed
rather
than
20


delivered
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
filing.
The
bill
does
21


not
alter
the
date
or
year
that
the
report
must
be
submitted
22


(for
certain
entities
in
even-numbered
years
and
for
the
23


remaining
entities
in
odd-numbered
years).
24


DIVISION
VI
——
ADMINISTRATIVE
DISSOLUTION
AND
REVOCATION.
25


The
bill
amends
the
ULPA,
RULLCA,
IBCA,
and
RINCA
Code
chapters
26


as
well
as
Code
chapters
governing
traditional
cooperatives,
27


closed
cooperatives,
and
cooperative-corporations.
The
bill
28


provides
for
administrative
dissolution
of
a
domestic
entity
29


and
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
authority
issued
30


to
a
foreign
entity.
The
ULPA
and
RULLCA
each
provide
two
31


relevant
Code
sections,
one
Code
section
which
provides
for
the
32


dissolution
of
a
domestic
entity
and
one
Code
section
which
33


provides
for
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
authority.
34


The
IBCA
and
the
RINCA
each
provide
four

sections.
In
each
Code
chapter,
two
related
Code
sections
1


provide
for
the
dissolution
of
a
domestic
entity
issued
a
2


certificate
of
existence
and
two
related
Code
sections
refer
3


to
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
authority
issued
to
a
4


foreign
entity.
For
example,
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
5


under
the
IBCA,
Code
section
490.1420
provides
“grounds”
for
6


administrative
dissolution
and
Code
section
490.1421
provides
7


for
the
“procedure.”
Similarly,
Code
section
490.1530
provides
8


grounds
for
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
authority
and
9


Code
section
490.1531
provides
for
the
revocation
procedure.
10


The
Code
chapter
governing
traditional
cooperatives
and
closed
11


cooperatives
includes
only
administrative
dissolution
Code
12


sections.
The
Code
chapter
governing
cooperative-corporations
13


does
not
provide
for
administrative
dissolution
by
the
14


secretary
of
state.
15


The
bill
amends
the
provisions
to
be
consistent
with
the
16


approach
of
the
ULPA
and
RULLCA,
by
including
one
Code
section
17


that
refers
to
administrative
dissolution
and
one
Code
section
18


that
refers
to
the
revocation
of
a
certificate
of
authority.
19


The
bill
provides
a
single
Code
section
covering
administrative
20


dissolution
that
includes
language
now
in
both
the
grounds
and
21


procedures
Code
sections.
Consequently,
the
bill
eliminates
22


the
procedure
Code
section
in
each
Code
chapter.
The
remaining
23


Code
section
in
each
Code
chapter
is
combined
with
its
24


procedure
section
and
that
section
is
repeated
with
small
25


variations
in
all
the
relevant
Code
chapters.
The
bill
also
26


adds
a
new
provision
in
the
combined
Code
section,
taken
from
27


the
IBCA
and
RINCA
Code
chapters
and
the
Code
chapter
governing
28


closed
cooperatives,
which
appoints
the
secretary
of
state
the
29


entity’s
agent
for
service
of
process.
30


The
bill
also
provides
for
the
revocation
of
a
foreign
31


entity’s
certificate
of
authority
in
those
Code
chapters
which
32


previously
provided
for
such
revocation,
including
the
ULPA,
33


RULLCA,
IBCA,
and
RINCA
as
well
as
the
Code
chapter
governing
34


traditional
cooperatives.

instead
authorizes

if
the
foreign

fails
to
comply
2


with
a

set

DIVISION
VII
——
NAMING
CONVENTIONS.
The
bill
amends
6


the
ULPA,
RULLCA,
IBCA,
and
RINCA
Code
chapters
and
7


Code
chapters
governing
traditional
cooperatives
and
8


cooperative-corporations.
In
all
these
cases,
a
domestic
9


entity
may
elect
to
use
a
fictitious
name
if
a
certified
10


copy
of
a
resolution
is
sent
to
the
secretary
of
state.
The
11


bill
provides
that
in
the
case
of
the
ULPA
Code
chapter
only
12


one
general
partner
is
required
to
certify
the
copy,
and
in
13


the
case
of
the
RULLCA
Code
chapter,
only
one
member
of
a
14


member-managed
limited
liability
company
or
one
manager
of
15


a
manager-managed
limited
liability
company
is
required
to
16


certify
the
copy.
In
the
case
of
the
IBCA
and

Code
17


chapters,
the
bill
allows
any
officer

a
corporation
to
