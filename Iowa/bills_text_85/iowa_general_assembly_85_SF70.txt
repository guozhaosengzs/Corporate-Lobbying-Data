EXPLANATION
26


This
bill
requires
each
contract
for
the
construction
of
27


a
public
improvement
made
by
a
governmental
unit
to
contain
28


a
provision
requiring
that
the
iron,
steel,
and
manufactured
29


goods
used
or
supplied
in
the
performance
of
the
contract
or
30


any
subcontract
be
manufactured
in
the
United
States.
The
bill
31


provides
definitions
for
“construction”,
“manufactured
in
the
32


United
States”,
and
“public
improvement”.
33


The
bill
provides
that
the
requirement
may
be
waived
if
a
34


person
with
the
necessary
authority
for
a
governmental
unit

finds
that
application
of
the
requirement
would
be
contrary
to
1


the
public
interest,
that
the
products
necessary
for
the
public
2


improvement
are
not
produced
in
the
United
States
in
sufficient
3


and
reasonably
available
quantities
and
of
a
satisfactory
4


quality,
or
that
the
requirement
would
increase
the
cost
of
the
5


contract
by
more
than
5
percent.
6


The
bill
provides
that
before
a
person
can
grant
a
waiver
of
7


the
requirement,
the
person
must
publish
and
make
available
a
8


detailed,
written
justification
as
to
why
the
waiver
is
needed.
9


The
justification
is
to
include
notice
of
an
opportunity
for
10


public
comment.
The
comment
period
is
to
be
for
a
reasonable
11


period
of
time
not
to
exceed
15
days.
The
person
must
consider
12


all
comments
received
during
the
comment
period
in
evaluating
13


whether
to
grant
a
waiver.
The
bill
limits
waiver
authority
14


for
foreign
countries
that
violate
the
terms
of
certain
trade
15


agreements
with
the
United
States.
16


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
is
ineligible
to
enter
17


into
any
contract
or
subcontract
with
a
governmental
unit
if
18


a
court
or
federal
or
state
agency
determines
that
the
person
19


intentionally
represented
that
any
product
used
in
a
public
20


improvement
was
manufactured
in
the
United
States
when
the
21


product
was
not
manufactured
in
the
United
States
or
affixed
22


a
label
bearing
a
“Made
in
America”
inscription,
or
any
23


inscription
with
the
same
meaning,
to
any
product
used
in
a
24


public
improvement
when
the
product
was
not
manufactured
in
the
25


United
States.
26


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
27


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
28


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
29


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
30


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
31


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
32


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
33


The
bill
applies
to
public
improvement
contracts
entered
34


into
on
or
after
July
1,
2013.
