Section

subsection
2,
Code
2014,
is
1


amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


2.
a.
An
electric
utility
subject
to
this
division
,
except
3


a
utility
that
elects
rate
regulation
pursuant
to
section
4


476.1A
,
shall
not
be
required
to
own
or
purchase,
at
any
one
5


time,
more
than
its
share
of
one
hundred
five
megawatts
of
6


power
from
alternative


alternate
energy
production
facilities
7


or
small
hydro
facilities
at
the
rates
established
pursuant
to
8


section
476.43
.
The
board
shall
allocate
the
one
hundred
five
9


megawatts
based
upon
each
utility’s
percentage
of
the
total
10


Iowa
retail
peak
demand,
for
the
year
beginning
January
1,
11


1990,
of
all
utilities
subject
to
this
section
.
Twenty-five
12


percent
of
an
electric
utility’s
share
as
determined
and
13


allocated
pursuant
to
this
paragraph
shall
be
derived
through
14


the
ownership
of,
or
purchase
of
alternate
energy
from,
a
15


solar
energy
facility.
If
a
utility
undergoes
reorganization
16


as
defined
in
section
476.76
,
the
board
shall
combine
the
17


allocated
purchases
of
power
for
each
utility
involved
in
the
18


reorganization.
19


b.
Notwithstanding
the
one
hundred
five
megawatt
maximum,
20


the
board
may
increase
the
amount
of
power
that
a
utility
21


is
required
to
own
or
purchase
at
the
rates
established
22


pursuant
to
section
476.43
if
the
board
finds
that
a
utility,
23


including
a
reorganized
utility,
exceeds
its
1990
Iowa
24


retail
peak
demand
by
twenty
percent
and
the
additional
25


power
the
utility
is
required
to
purchase
will
encourage
the
26


development
of
alternate
energy
production
facilities
and
27


small
hydro
facilities.
The
increase
shall
not
exceed
the
28


utility’s
increase
in
peak
demand
multiplied
by
the
ratio
of
29


the
utility’s
share
of
the
one
hundred
five
megawatt
maximum
30


to
its
1990
Iowa
retail
peak
demand.
If
the
board
increases


31


the
amount
of
power
a
utility
is
required
to
own
or
purchase


32


pursuant
to
this
paragraph,
the
twenty-five
percent
solar


33


energy
ownership
or
purchase
requirement
specified
in
paragraph


34


“a”


shall
be
applicable
to
the
increased
amount.

not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
alternate
energy
purchase
requirements
4


imposed
upon
electric
utilities
by
the
Iowa
utilities
board.
5


Currently,
electric
utilities
are
required
to
own
alternate
6


energy
production
facilities
or
small
hydro
facilities
located
7


in
Iowa,
or
to
enter
into
long-term
contracts
to
purchase
or
8


wheel
electricity
from
such
facilities.
Alternate
energy
9


production
facilities
are
defined
in
Code
section
476.42
10


to
include
solar,
wind
turbine,
waste
management,
resource
11


recovery,
refuse-derived
fuel,
agricultural
crops
or
residues,
12


or
woodburning
facilities.
13


There
is
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
electricity
required
14


to
be
produced
by
a
facility
which
is
owned
by
an
electric
15


utility,
or
purchased
or
wheeled
from
an
alternate
energy
16


production
facility
or
small
hydro
facility.
An
electric
17


utility
is
not
required
to
own
or
purchase,
at
any
one
time,
18


more
than
its
share
of
105
megawatts
of
power
from
alternate
19


energy
production
facilities
or
small
hydro
facilities.
The
20


bill
provides
that
25
percent
of
an
electric
utility’s
share
21


shall
be
derived
through
the
ownership
of,
or
purchase
of
22


alternate
energy
from,
a
solar
energy
facility,
and
that
if
23


the
board
increases
the
amount
of
power
a
utility
is
required
24


to
own
or
purchase,
the
25
percent
solar
energy
ownership
or
25


purchase
requirement
shall
be
applicable
to
the
increased
26


amount.
