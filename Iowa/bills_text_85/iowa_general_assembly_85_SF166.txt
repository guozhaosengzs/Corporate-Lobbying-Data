NEW

Negotiated
rulemaking.
1


1.
An
agency
shall
create
a
negotiated
rulemaking
group
if
2


required
by
statute.
An
agency
may,
on
its
own
motion
or
upon
3


request,
create
a
negotiated
rulemaking
group
if
the
agency
4


determines
that
a
negotiated
rulemaking
group
can
adequately
5


represent
the
interests
that
will
be
significantly
affected
by
6


a
draft
rule
proposal
and
that
it
is
feasible
and
appropriate
7


in
the
particular
rulemaking.
Notice
of
the
creation
of
a
8


negotiated
rulemaking
group
shall
be
published
in
the
Iowa
9


administrative
bulletin.
Upon
establishing
a
negotiated
10


rulemaking
group,
the
agency
shall
also
specify
a
time
frame
11


for
group
deliberations.
12


2.
Unless
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
the
agency
shall
13


appoint
a
sufficient
number
of
members
to
the
group
so
that
14


a
fair
cross
section
of
interests
and
opinions
regarding
the
15


draft
rule
proposal
is
represented.
One
person
shall
be
16


appointed
to
represent
the
agency.
The
group
shall
select
its
17


own
chairperson
and
adopt
its
rules
of
procedure.
All
meetings
18


of
the
group
shall
be
open
to
the
public.
A
majority
of
the
19


membership
constitutes
a
quorum.
Members
shall
not
receive
20


any
per
diem
payment
but
shall
be
reimbursed
for
all
necessary
21


expenses.
Any
vacancy
shall
be
filled
in
the
same
manner
as
22


the
initial
appointment.
23


3.
Prior
to
the
publication
of
a
notice
of
intended
action,
24


the
group
shall
consider
the
terms
or
substance
of
the
rule
25


proposed
by
the
agency
and
shall
attempt
to
reach
a
consensus
26


on
the
advisability
of
adopting
the
draft
rule
proposal.
27


4.
If
a
group
reaches
a
consensus
on
a
draft
rule
proposal,
28


the
group
shall
transmit
to
the
agency
a
report
containing
the
29


consensus
on
the
draft
rule
proposal.
If
the
group
does
not
30


reach
a
consensus
on
a
draft
rule
proposal
within
the
specified
31


time
frame,
the
group
shall
transmit
to
the
agency
a
report
32


stating
that
inability
to
reach
a
consensus
and
specifying
any
33


areas
in
which
the
group
reached
a
consensus.
The
group
may
34


include
in
a
report
any
other
information,
recommendations,

or
materials
that
the
group
considers
appropriate.
Any
group
1


member
may
include
as
an
addendum
to
the
report
additional
2


information,
recommendations,
or
materials.
A
report
issued
3


under
this
subsection
shall
not
be
considered
final
agency
4


action
for
purposes
of
judicial
review.
5


5.
Unless
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
following
6


consideration
of
a
draft
rule
proposal
by
a
negotiated
7


rulemaking
group,
the
agency
may
commence
rulemaking
as
8


provided
in
section
17A.4.
The
group
is
automatically
9


abolished
upon
the
agencyâ€™s
adoption
of
the
rule
pursuant
to
10


the
provisions
of
section
17A.5.
11


EXPLANATION
12


If
required
by
statute,
this
bill
requires
an
agency
to
13


create
an
ad
hoc
negotiated
rulemaking
group
to
review
draft
14


rule
proposals
prior
to
commencing
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
15


Where
a
statute
does
not
require
this
review,
the
bill
allows
16


an
agency
to
create
such
a
review
group.
Members
are
appointed
17


by
the
agency
and
the
composition
must
adequately
represent
a
18


fair
balance
of
the
interests
affected
by
the
rule.
Once
such
19


a
group
is
created,
the
agency
may
only
commence
rulemaking
20


after
the
group
has
considered
the
draft
rule
proposal
in
21


question.
This
provision
is
based
on
similar
provisions
found
22


in
the
federal
Administrative
Procedures
Act.
