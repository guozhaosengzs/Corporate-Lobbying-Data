1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
the
relationships
that
2


humans
develop
with
other
members
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
3


are
taken
into
homes
and
maintained
as
companions
are
unique
4


and
special.
These
relationships
can
enrich
lives
and
increase
5


happiness.
Even
after
the
death
of
a
companion
animal,
human
6


attachment
to
the
memory
of
the
companion
animal
often
remains
7


very
strong
and
many
people
feel
the
need
to
memorialize
the
8


love
felt
for
the
animal
by
burying
the
companion
animal
in
9


a
companion
animal
cemetery.
Companion
animal
cemeteries
10


and
their
owners
and
operators
have
a
special
responsibility
11


to
customers
who
have
entrusted
pet
remains
to
them.
These
12


companion
animal
cemeteries
have
a
duty
to
act
in
an
ethical
13


and
lawful
manner
to
prevent
grieving
companion
animal
14


owners
from
experiencing
further
emotional
pain
or
financial
15


manipulation.
Perpetrations
of
fraud
against
grieving
16


companion
animal
owners
are
unconscionable.
17


2.
The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
the
people
18


of
this
state
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
establishment,
19


maintenance,
and
preservation
of
companion
animal
cemeteries
20


and
companion
animal
crematoriums
and
the
proper
operation
21


of
the
businesses
and
individuals
that
own
and
manage
the
22


businesses.
This
chapter
is
determined
to
be
an
exercise
of
23


the
police
powers
of
this
state
to
protect
the
well-being
of
24


citizens
of
this
state,
to
promote
the
public
welfare,
to
25


promote
the
health
of
the
public,
and
to
prevent
companion
26


animal
cemeteries
and
companion
animal
crematoriums
from
27


falling
into
disrepair
and
dilapidation
and
becoming
a
burden
28


upon
the
community.
