EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
includes
provisions
that
relate
to
programs
and
20


services
under
the
purview
of
the
department
of
public
health
21


(DPH).
The
bill
is
organized
in
divisions.
22


Division
I
relates
to
the
membership
of
the
system
23


evaluation
and
quality
improvement
committee
for
the
trauma
24


system
in
the
state.
The
bill
changes
the
membership
by
25


replacing
the
specific
name
of
the
one
membership
entity
26


with
a
general
reference
to
the
Medicare
quality
improvement
27


organization
in
the
state.
28


Division
II
relates
to
county
reimbursement
for
29


investigations
and
autopsies
that
are
for
persons
who
die
after
30


being
brought
into
the
state
for
emergency
medical
treatment
31


by
or
at
the
direction
of
an
out-of-state
law
enforcement
32


officer
or
public
authority;
or
for
autopsies
relating
to
the
33


death
of
a
child
under
the
age
of
two
years
if
death
results
34


from
an
unknown
cause
or
if
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
35

death
indicate
that
sudden
infant
death
syndrome
may
be
the
1


cause
of
death.
Current
law
directs
that
claims
for
these
2


investigations
and
autopsies
are
to
be
filed
by
counties
3


initially
with
DPH,
and,
if
moneys
are
not
appropriated
to
4


DPH
for
this
purpose,
the
claims
are
to
then
be
forwarded
to
5


the
state
appeal
board.
Under
the
bill,
claims
would
not
be
6


initially
filed
with
DPH,
but
would
instead
be
filed
directly
7


with
the
state
appeal
board
for
authorization
of
payment
8


from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
from
funds
not
otherwise
9


appropriated.
10


Division
III
relates
to
human
immunodeficiency
virus
11


(HIV)
home
test
kits.
Current
law
prohibits
a
person
from
12


advertising
for
sale,
offering
for
sale,
or
selling
an
HIV
13


home
testing
kit
for
antibody
or
antigen
testing,
and
provides
14


civil
and
criminal
penalties
as
well
as
injunctive
relief
for
15


violation
of
the
prohibition.
The
United
States
food
and
drug
16


administration
approved
the
use
of
such
kits
in
July
2012,
and
17


the
bill
repeals
the
Code
provision
prohibiting
the
HIV
home
18


test
kits
in
the
state.
19


Division
IV
of
the
bill
provides
that
a
minor
shall
have
20


the
legal
capacity
to
act
and
give
consent
to
the
provision
21


of
tobacco
cessation
services
by
a
hospital,
clinic,
health
22


care
provider,
or
other
tobacco
cessation
services
provider.
23


Consent
is
not
subject
to
later
disaffirmance
by
reason
of
such
24


minority,
and
the
consent
of
another
person
is
not
necessary.
