of
the

county,
representing
at

the

of
the

county.

The
bill
amends
the
methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
5


the
local
option
sales
and
services
tax
to
the
voters
by
6


allowing
the
eligible
electors
of
individual
cities
and
the
7


unincorporated
area
of
a
county
to
file
a
petition
for
an
8


election
to
be
held
in
the
petitioning
jurisdiction
if
such
9


petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
city
or
the
10


unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
applicable,
equal
in
11


number
to
five
percent
of
the
persons
in
the
applicable
city
12


or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
13


preceding
general
election.
14


The
bill
also
removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
15


the
local
sales
and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
16


motions
must
be
approved
by
cities
or
the
county
for
the
17


unincorporated
area,
representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
18


county’s
population.
Instead,
the
bill
allows
individual
19


cities
or
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area
to
approve
a
20


motion
for
an
election
on
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
to
21


be
held
in
only
that
jurisdiction.
22


The
bill
consequently
removes
the
requirements
related
to
23


approval
of
a
ballot
question
by
cities
that
are
contiguous
to
24


each
other
and
special
provisions
related
to
the
approval
and
25


imposition
of
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
a
city
that
is
26


located
in
more
than
one
county.
27


The
bill
provides
that
a
local
sales
and
services
tax
28


approved
by
the
voters
may
not
be
imposed
for
a
period
29


exceeding
10
years.
In
addition,
the
bill
provides
that
if
a
30


proposition
for
the
imposition
of
a
local
sales
and
services
31


tax
submitted
to
the
voters
of
a
city
or
the
unincorporated
32


area
of
a
county
fails
to
gain
approval,
it
shall
not
be
33


resubmitted
to
the
voters
of
that
jurisdiction
in
substantially
34


the
same
form
for
a
period
of
three
years
following

may
only

of
a

or

2


Current
Code
section
423B.7
specifies
the
allocation
3


formula
for
local
sales
and
services
tax
revenue
among
the
4


jurisdictions
imposing
the
tax
within
a
county.
Seventy-five
5


percent
of
each
county’s
account
containing
such
tax
revenue
6


is
remitted
to
the
tax-imposing
jurisdictions
on
the
basis
of
7


the
county’s
population
residing
in
the
unincorporated
area
8


where
the
tax
is
imposed
and
those
incorporated
areas
where
9


the
tax
is
imposed
and
25
percent
of
each
county’s
account
is
10


remitted
based
on
the
sum
of
property
tax
dollars
levied
in
11


the
incorporated
areas
and
unincorporated
area
where
the
tax
12


is
imposed.
13


The
bill
strikes
this
allocation
formula
for
local
sales
and
14


services
taxes
newly
imposed
after
July
1,
2013,
and
provides
15


that
each
county’s
account
shall
be
allocated
to
and
remitted
16


to
the
jurisdictions
imposing
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
17


on
the
basis
of
the
location
where
the
tax
was
collected.
A
18


city
receives
all
local
sales
and
services
tax
collected
in
19


the
city
and
the
county
receives
all
local
sales
and
services
20


tax
collected
in
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county.
The
21


bill
imposes
a
duty
on
each
city
or
county
where
a
local
sales
22


and
services
tax
is
imposed
to
assist
the
department
of
revenue
23


in
identifying
retail
establishments
within
their
jurisdiction
24


that
are
collecting
the
local
sales
and
services
tax.
25


The
bill
does
not
affect
the
imposition
and
collection
of
a
26


local
tax
imposed,
or
that
will
take
effect,
as
the
result
of
27


a
petition
received
or
a
motion
approved
before
July
1,
2013.
28


Such
local
taxes
will
continue
to
be
collected
and
disbursed
29


to
the
relevant
tax-imposing
jurisdictions
pursuant
to
the
30


provisions
of
Code
chapter
423B,
Code
2013,
until
10
years
31


after
July
1,
2013,
the
repeal
date
specified
in
the
ordinance
32


imposing
the
tax,
the
date
when
bonded
indebtedness
secured
33


by
the
tax
is
retired,
or
such
time
as
the
tax
is
repealed,
34


whichever
is
sooner.
