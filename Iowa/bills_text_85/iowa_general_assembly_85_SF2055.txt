BACKGROUND
——
GOVERNANCE.
Under
Code
chapter
468,
drainage
14


or
levee
districts
are
established
and
managed
by
different
15


forms
of
governing
boards.
An
intracounty
district
is
16


established
and
managed
by
a
county
board
of
supervisors
in
17


the
county
where
the
district
is
located
(Subchapter
I,
Part
18


1
——
Code
sections
468.1
through
468.200).
An
intercounty
19


district
may
be
established
in
two
or
more
counties
and
managed
20


by
a
joint
board
of
supervisors
(Subchapter
II,
Part
1
——
Code
21


sections
468.270
through
468.304),
and
two
or
more
intracounty
22


districts
located
in
more
than
one
county
may
be
converted
into
23


an
intercounty
district
and
again
managed
by
a
joint
board
of
24


supervisors
(Subchapter
II,
Part
2
——
Code
sections
468.305
25


through
468.314).
A
drainage
district
may
also
be
placed
under
26


the
management
of
a
board
of
trustees
(Subchapter
III,
Parts
1
27


through
3
——
Code
sections
468.500
through
468.539).
28


BACKGROUND
——
CONTRACTING
FOR
WORK.
The
governing
board
29


is
required
to
appoint
an
engineer
to
supervise
work
projects
30


in
the
district,
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
“supervising
31


engineer”
(Code
sections
468.33
and
468.287).
When
a
district
32


is
established
the
governing
board
must
award
a
contract
or
33


contracts
to
contractors
bidding
on
the
project
according
to
34


specific
procedures
(Code
section
468.35).
After
the
district
35


-2-


LSB
5421XS
(4)
85


da/sc
2/
3





S.F.
2055


is
established,
the
governing
board
may
order
repairs
to
the
1


district
or
order
an
improvement
to
be
made
to
the
district
2


in
a
manner
that
expands,
enlarges
or
otherwise
increases
its
3


capacity
(Code
section
468.126).
The
governing
board
must
4


award
a
contract
or
contracts
to
contractors
bidding
on
the
5


project
according
to
specific
procedures
(Code
section
468.35).
6


BACKGROUND
——
PAYMENT.
A
district
contracting
for
7


construction
work
may
pay
a
contractor
for
construction
costs
8


by
drawing
a
warrant
or
issuing
a
bond
or
drainage
certificate
9


(Code
sections
468.74,
468.145,
and
468.285).
The
warrants
may
10


be,
and
the
bonds
or
certificates
are,
payable
at
a
future
date
11


with
accrued
interest.
During
construction
the
supervising
12


engineer
must
provide
the
county
auditor
with
a
monthly
13


estimate
of
work
completed
and
payments
due
to
the
contractor.
14


The
supervising
engineer’s
estimate
is
used
as
the
basis
for
15


interim
payments
to
the
contractor
for
up
to
90
percent
of
the
16


work
completed.
Upon
the
work’s
completion,
the
supervising
17


engineer
files
a
report
with
the
governing
board
which
holds
a
18


public
hearing
of
affected
landowners
to
determine
if
there
are
19


objections
prior
to
final
settlement
of
amounts
due
under
the
20


construction
contract
(Code
sections
468.101
through
468.103,
21


and
468.292).
