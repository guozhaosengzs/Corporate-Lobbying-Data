district’s
average
transportation
costs
per

aid
to
the
district.
This
bill
allows
such
25


transportation

if

transportation
costs
per
pupil.
28


Current

29


district
exceeds
its

The

a
school
10


district
with
district
transportation
costs
per
pupil
in
excess
11


of
the
state
average
transportation
costs
per
pupil,
as
those
12


amounts
are
determined
under

to
13


certify
for
levy
a
tax
on
all
taxable
property
in
the
school
14


district
for
a
transportation
cost
supplemental
levy.
The
15


amount
certified
by
a

16


budget
year
shall
not
exceed
an
