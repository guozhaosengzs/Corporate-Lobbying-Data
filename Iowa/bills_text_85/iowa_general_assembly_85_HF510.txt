EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
modifies
provisions
applicable
to
the
10


administration
and
funding
of
enhanced
E911
emergency
11


communication
systems.
12


The
bill
eliminates
existing
voter
referendum
requirements
13


regarding
imposition
of
the
local
wire-line
E911
service
14


surcharge
and
the
alternative
surcharge
applicable
to
wire-line
15


communications
contained
in
Code
sections
34A.6
and
34A.6A,
16


respectively.
The
bill
replaces
current
provisions
authorizing
17


imposition
of
the
wire-line
E911
service
surcharge
in
an
amount
18


up
to
$1
per
access
line
with
a
requirement
that
the
surcharge
19


be
imposed
at
the
$1
level.
The
bill
increases
the
level
of
20


the
emergency
communications
service
surcharge
from
the
current
21


level
of
up
to
65
cents
per
communications
service
number
to
22


$1
per
service
number.
23


The
bill
reinstates
provisions
authorizing
wireless
carriers
24


to
recover
their
E911
service
delivery
costs
which
were
25


eliminated
during
the
2012
legislative
session.
However,
the
26


bill
specifies
that
the
program
manager
shall
allocate
13
27


percent
of
the
total
amount
of
emergency
communications
service
28


surcharge
revenue
for
such
cost
recovery.
Further,
the
bill
29


requires
the
E911
program
manager
to
consult
with
the
E911
30


communications
council
regarding
how
revenue
accumulated
in
the
31


emergency
communications
fund
as
carryover
operating
surplus
32


shall
be
allocated.
Currently,
this
determination
is
made
33


strictly
with
the
approval
of
the
program
manager.
34


Additionally,
the
bill

public

2

point
cost
and
expense
data
through
the
county

The
bill
states
that
data
4


collection
shall
commence
no
later
than
January
1,
2014,
and
5


that
the
program
manager
shall
prepare
a
report
detailing
6


the
methodology
and
the
data
collected
after
the
data
has
7


been
collected
for
two
years.
The
report
is
required
to
be
8


submitted
to
the
general
assembly
by
March
1,
2016,
and
every
9


two
years
thereafter.
The
bill
provides
that
a
county
joint
10


E911
service
board
which
fails
to
submit
expenses
and
costs
11


pursuant
to
the
methodology
by
March
31
of
each
year
shall
12


be
allocated
65
cents
out
of
the
$1
emergency
communications
13


service
surcharge
until
March
31
of
the
following
year.
The
14


remaining
funds
shall
be
held
in
the
carryover
operating
15


surplus
fund
until
the
expenses
and
cost
report
is
submitted
16


by
the
county
joint
E911
service
board.
Further,
the
bill
17


provides
that
if
the
county
joint
E911
service
board
submits
18


the
expense
report
prior
to
March
30
of
the
following
year,
19


the
set
aside
funds
shall
be
provided
to
the
board,
but
if
20


the
board
fails
to
submit
the
report
within
one
year,
the
21


funds
shall
revert
to
the
carryover
operating
surplus
fund
22


and
be
used
in
accordance
with
Code
section
34A.7A.
That
23


Code
section
states
that
carryover
surplus
funds
shall
be
24


used
to
fund
future
network
and
public
safety

including

related

if
28


those
costs
are
not
otherwise
recovered
by
wireless
carriers
29


through
customer

or
other

and
