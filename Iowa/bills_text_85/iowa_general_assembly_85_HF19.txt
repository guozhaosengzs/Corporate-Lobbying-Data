EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
provides
employee
leave
by
providing
for
time
off
18


and
vacation
leave.
19


The
bill
relates
to
payments
for
accrued
vacation
time
and
20


for
accrued
paid
time
off
for
all
employees
who
are
terminated
21


or
suspended.
22


Current
law
requires
an
employer
to
pay
accrued
vacation
pay
23


to
a
terminated
or
suspended
employee
only
if
the
employer
has
24


a
policy,
procedure,
or
contract
that
requires
the
employer
to
25


do
so.
26


The
bill
defines
“paid
time
off”
as
a
benefit
allowing
an
27


employee
to
take
time
off
from
work
with
pay
without
regard
to
28


the
reason
the
employee
chooses
to
take
the
time
off.
“Paid
29


time
off”
is
also
added
to
the
definition
of
“wages”.
30


The
bill
provides
that
if
an
employee
is
suspended
or
31


terminated,
upon
request
the
employer
must
pay
all
earned
32


wages,
now
including
paid
time
off,
by
the
next
regular
payday.
33


The
bill
provides
for
an
employee
who
earned
paid
time
off
34


while
employed
but
did
not
earn
vacation,
that
the
employer
may
35

reduce
the
pay
for
the
accrued
paid
time
off
by
one-third.
For
1


an
employee
who
earned
both
vacation
and
paid
time
off
while
2


employed,
the
employer
is
not
required
to
make
payment
for
the
3


paid
time
off.
4


An
employer
shall
not
adopt
a
policy
or
practice
to
deny
5


payment
for
accrued
vacation
or
accrued
paid
time
off
upon
the
6


suspension
or
termination
of
an
employee
unless
the
employee’s
7


employment
ended
due
to
misconduct.
Misconduct
is
not
defined
8


in
statute
but
is
defined
in
the
department
of
workforce
9


development’s
administrative
rules.
10


The
bill
provides
for
the
calculation
and
payment
of
an
11


employee’s
accrued
paid
time
off
or
vacation
if
the
employee
12


is
suspended
or
terminated.
The
amount
of
such
pay
owed
to
an
13


employee
is
the
amount
of
pay
equal
to
the
accrued
vacation
or
14


paid
time
off
as
if
the
employee
began
taking
the
vacation
or
15


paid
time
off
the
day
the
suspension
or
termination
took
place.
16


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
The
bill
is
made
17


applicable
only
to
the
suspension
or
termination
of
an
18


employee’s
employment
that
occurs
on
or
after
that
date.
