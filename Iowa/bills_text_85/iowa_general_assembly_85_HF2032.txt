a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
care
19


facility
or
hospital
who
makes
application
for
an
absentee
20


ballot
is,
in
most
circumstances,
delivered
the
ballot
by
two
21


special
precinct
election
officials
appointed
by
the
county
22


commissioner
of
elections.
This
bill
allows
an
applicant
who
23


is
a
resident
or
patient
of
a
health
care
facility
or
hospital
24


to
request
mail
