Code

as
follows:
2


10.
a.


Adopt
rules
specifying
the
minimum
training
and
3


performance
standards
for
an
individual
using
a
radiation
4


machine
for
mammography,
and
other
rules
necessary
to
5


implement
section
136C.15
.
The
rules
shall
complement
federal
6


requirements
applicable
to
similar
radiation
machinery
and
7


shall
not
be
less
stringent
than
those
federal
requirements.
8


b.
(1)
Adopt
rules
to
require
that,
by
January
1,
2015,
a
9


facility
where
mammography
services
are
performed
shall
include
10


information
on
breast
density
in
mammogram
reports
sent
to
11


referring
physicians
and
written
statements
sent
to
patients
12


pursuant
to
regulations
implementing
the
federal
Mammography
13


Quality
Standards
Act
of
1992,
Pub.
L.
No.
102-539,
as
amended.
14


A
written
statement
sent
to
a
patient
shall
include
information
15


that
identifies
the
patient’s
individual
breast
tissue
16


classification
based
on
the
breast
imaging
reporting
and
data


17


system
established
by
the
American
college
of
radiology.
If
18


the
interpreting
physician,
based
on
standards
promulgated
by
19


the
American
college
of
radiology,
determines
that
a
patient
20


has
heterogeneously
or
extremely
dense
breasts,
the
written


21


statement
of
the
mammography
report
shall
also
include
the


22


following
language:
23


Your
mammography
indicates
that
you
have
dense
breast
tissue.
24


Dense
breast
tissue
is
relatively
common
and
is
found
in
forty


25


percent
of
women.
The
presence
of
dense
tissue
makes
it
more


26


difficult
to
detect
cancers
in
the
breast
and
may
be
associated
27


with
an
increased
risk
of
breast
cancer.
We
are
providing
this
28


information
to
raise
your
awareness
of
this
important
factor
29


and
to
encourage
you
to
discuss
with
your
health
care
providers
30


your
dense
breast
tissue
and
other
breast
cancer
risk
factors.


31


Together,
you
can
decide
which
screening
options
are
right
for


32


you.
A
report
of
your
results
was
sent
to
your
physician.


33


(2)


Nothing
in
this
paragraph
“b”
shall
be
construed
to
34


create
or
impose
liability
on
a
facility
where
mammography

services
are
performed
beyond
the
duty
to
provide
the
1


information
set
forth
in
this
paragraph


“b”
.
2


(3)
Nothing
in
this
paragraph
“b”
shall
be
deemed
to
require
3


a
notice
or
the
provision
of
information
that
is
inconsistent
4


with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
Mammography
Quality
5


Standards
Act
of
1992,
Pub.
L.
No.
102-539,
as
amended,
or
any


6


regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
that
Act.

EXPLANATION
8


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
9


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
10


This
bill
establishes
a
notification
requirement
for
11


mammogram
reports
and
written
statements
to
patients.
The
bill
12


directs
the
department
of
public
health
to
adopt
rules
that
13


require
a
facility
performing
mammography
services
to
include
14


information
on
breast
density
in
reports
sent
to
referring
15


physicians
and
written
statements
sent
to
patients
pursuant
to
16


federal
law
and
rules.
If
a
patient
has
dense
breast
tissue,
17


as
determined
by
the
interpreting
physician
based
on
standards
18


promulgated
by
the
American
college
of
radiology,
the
written
19


statement
must
contain
a
notice
with
the
language
provided
in
20


the
bill.
The
notice
informs
the
patient
that
the
mammogram
21


demonstrates
the
patient
has
dense
breast
tissue
and
encourages
22


the
patient
to
contact
health
care
providers
to
determine
risk
23


factors
and
screening
options.
24


The
bill’s
provisions
are
not
to
be
construed
to
impose
25


liability
on
the
facility
performing
mammography
services
26


beyond
the
duty
to
provide
the
breast
density
information.
27


Facilities
providing
mammography
services
must
comply
with
28


the
bill’s
requirements
by
January
1,
2015.
