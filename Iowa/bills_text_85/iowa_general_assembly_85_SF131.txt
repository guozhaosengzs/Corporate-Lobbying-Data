An
29


economic

may
represent
more
than

but
no
city
or

area
of
a
county
may
be

by
more

In

recent
business

34


or
permanent

The
EDA
has
60

after
November
30
to
choose
up
to
5


10
counties
to
participate
in
the
program.
In
making
its
6


selection
decisions,
the
EDA
is
required
to
consider
all
7


information
contained
in
a
program
application
and
any
other
8


relevant
information,
giving
priority
to
counties
that
have
9

a
recent
business
closure
or
permanent
layoff
with
a
10


significant
negative
impact
in
the
county,
that
have
potential

projects
in
the
county,
that
have
12


unemployment

average,
and
that
13


have
experienced
a
recent
loss
of
population.
14

county
is
eligible

purchasers
in
that
county
for
the

into
the

32


in
a
special
