H.F.
161


This
bill
requires
regional
mental
health
and
disability
1


services
to
be
provided
to
both
children
and
adults.
2


Under
current
law
enacted
in
2012
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1120
3


(SF
2315)
to
redesign
mental
health
and
disability
services,
4


counties
are
in
the
process
of
forming
into
regions
to
provide
5


a
system
for
the
delivery
of
such
services
to
adults
that
are
6


not
covered
by
the
medical
assistance
(Medicaid)
program.
7


Initially,
the
service
system
is
required
to
cover
adults
with
8


mental
health
needs
and
adults
with
an
intellectual
disability.
9


Under
current
law,
the
state
has
financial
and
10


administrative
responsibility
for
publicly
financed
disability
11


services
for
adults
and
children
with
mental
illness,
12


intellectual
disability
or
other
developmental
disability,
or
13


brain
injury
covered
under
the
Medicaid
program.
Counties
14


operating
together
as
regions
in
this
state
have
financial
and
15


administrative
responsibility
for
non-Medicaid
mental
health
16


and
intellectual
disability
services
provided
to
adults.
17


The
bill
expands
this
regional
system
responsibility
18


to
include
children.
However,
the
bill
specifies
that
the
19


regional
service
system
is
not
responsible
for
such
mental
20


health
and
intellectual
disability
services
for
a
child
subject
21


to
a
court
order
under
Code
chapter
232
(primarily
juvenile
22


delinquency,
child
in
need
of
assistance,
and
termination
of
23


parental
rights),
services
recommended
or
authorized
by
the
24


department
or
juvenile
court
services
to
avoid
or
eliminate
25


the
need
for
such
a
court
order,
services
provided
through
26


the
mental
health
service
system
for
children
and
youth
27


administered
by
the
department
of
human
services
under
Code
28


chapter
225G,
and
other
public
welfare,
child
welfare,
and
29


juvenile
justice
services
funded
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
30


state
or
federal
government.
31


Current
law
in
Code
section
331.396
includes
eligibility
for
32


services
under
the
regional
service
system
for
the
three-month
33


period
preceding
age
18
for
children
receiving
publicly
funded
34


children’s
services
in
order
to
provide
a
smooth
transition

to
the
adult
system.
The
bill
continues
this
eligibility
for
1


children
transitioning
from
state-funded
children’s
services
to
2


the
county-funded
regional
system.
3


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
4


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
5


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
6


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
7


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
8


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
9


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
