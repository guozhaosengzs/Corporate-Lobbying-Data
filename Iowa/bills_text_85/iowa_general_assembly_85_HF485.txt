be
executed
on
the
same
piece
of
paper.
1


The
bill
requires
that
a
voter
provide
proof
of
2


identification
to
a
precinct
election
official
before
being
3


allowed
to
vote,
and
also
requires
that
a
person
wishing
to
4


vote
by
absentee
ballot
at
a
county
commissioner
of
elections
5


office
or
at
a
satellite
absentee
voting
station
present
6


the
same
proof
of
identification.
The
bill
requires
that
7


acceptable
proof
of
identification
show
the
name
of
the
8


individual
voter,
include
a
photograph
of
the
voter,
and
be
9


issued
by
the
government
of
the
United
States,
the
state
of
10


Iowa,
an
Iowa
public
or
private
university
or
college,
an
Iowa
11


secondary
school,
or
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
12


The
bill
provides
that,
in
lieu
of
providing
identification
13


in
order
to
vote,
a
person
may
establish
proof
of
14


identification
by
written
oath
of
the
person
wishing
to
vote
15


and
of
a
person
who
provides
their
own
proof
of
identification
16


and
who
attests
to
the
voter’s
identity.
The
bill
provides
17


that
the
oath
shall
be
in
the
form
prescribed
by
the
state
18


commissioner
of
elections,
and
that
the
oath
shall
state
the
19


identity
of
the
person
wishing
to
vote
and
shall
attest
to
20


the
stated
identity
of
the
person
wishing
to
vote.
The
bill
21


requires
that
the
oath
be
signed
by
both
the
attesting
person
22


and
the
person
wishing
to
vote.
The
bill
makes
it
a
class
“D”
23


felony
to
falsely
swear
to
or
affirm
an
oath
pursuant
to
this
24


provision
or
to
falsely
attest
to
a
voter’s
identity.
The
bill
25


requires
that
the
oath
advise
both
persons
that
falsely
stating
26


or
attesting
to
a
voter’s
identity
is
a
class
“D”
felony.
A
27


class
“D”
felony
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
28


five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$750
but
not
more
than
$7,500.
29


The
bill
provides
that
an
attesting
person
is
prohibited
from
30


signing
any
additional
such
oaths
for
the
same
election.
31


The
bill
provides
that
if
proof
of
identification
is
32


established
the
person
shall
then
be
allowed
to
vote.
If
a
33


person
is
unable
or
refuses
to
present
proof
of
identification,
34


or
if
the
precinct
election
official
determines
that
the
35


-14-

(2)

aw/sc
14/
16



H.F.
485


proof
of
identification
does
not
meet
specified
requirements,
1


the
person
shall
be
offered
the
option
to
vote
a
provisional
2


ballot.
If
a
person
is
casting
a
provisional
ballot
3


under
these
circumstances,
the
person
shall
receive
a
4


printed
statement
giving
notice
of
the
types
of
acceptable
5


identification
and
notice
that
the
person
is
required
to
show
6


acceptable
identification
before
the
provisional
ballot
can
7


be
counted.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
a
voter
casting
8


a
provisional
ballot
for
this
reason
may
execute
an
affidavit
9


in
the
form
prescribed
by
the
state
commissioner
of
elections,
10


affirming
that
the
voter
is
the
person
the
voter
claims
to
be
11


and
affirming
that
the
voter
is
either
indigent
and
unable
to
12


obtain
proof
of
identification
without
the
payment
of
a
fee
or
13


that
the
voter
has
a
religious
objection
to
being
photographed.
14


The
bill
makes
it
a
class
“D”
felony
to
falsify
an
affidavit
15


that
attests
to
identity.
A
class
“D”
felony
is
punishable
by
16


confinement
for
no
more
than
five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
17


$750
but
not
more
than
$7,500.
The
bill
also
provides
that
18


any
provisional
ballot
cast
accompanied
by
such
an
affidavit
19


shall
be
presumed
valid
unless
additional
written
statements
20


or
documents
are
delivered
to
the
county
commissioner
of
21


elections
office
prior
to
the
date
that
provisional
ballots
22


are
considered
and
the
precinct
election
board
determines
that
23


such
additional
evidence
successfully
rebuts
the
presumption
24


of
validity.
25


The
bill
also
makes
changes
to
the
election
notice
to
be
26


published
by
the
county
commissioner
of
elections
to
require
27


that
election
notices
include
a
statement
that
all
voters
will
28


be
required
to
show
proof
of
identification
before
casting
a
29


ballot.
30


The
bill
requires
that
persons
residing
in
a
hospital
or
31


health
care
facility
who
apply
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
32


shall
present
proof
of
identification.
If
the
applicant
is
33


unable
to
present
proof
of
identification
they
shall
be
able
34


to
execute
an
affidavit

and
that
the

If
the

refuses
to

such
an
affidavit
and
is
unable
to
4


present
proof
of
identification,
the
voter
is
allowed
to
cast
a

The
bill
further
extends
all
provisions
6


applying
to
balloting
by
residents
of
a
health
care
facility
7


and
hospital
patients
to
include
tenants
of
an

The

also
provides

for
the
purpose
of
voting
11


shall
not
be

The

for

be
