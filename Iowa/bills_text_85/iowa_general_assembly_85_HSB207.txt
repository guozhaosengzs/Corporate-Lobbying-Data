1


This

The

fee
schedule
for
all
5


fees
collected
by
a
county
for
services,
other
than
building
6


permit
fees
and
fees
collected
on
behalf
of
the
state.
Each
7


fee
shall
be
calculated
based

cost
of
providing
8


the
particular
service
for
which
the
fee
is
charged.
The
bill
9


requires
that

cost
11


of
each
service
and
the

13


The
bill
further
provides
that

an

all

collected
by
a

for
services
other
than
building
16


permit
fees
and
fees
collected
on
behalf
of
the
state.
Each
17


fee
shall
be
calculated
based
upon
the
actual
cost
of
providing
18


the
particular
service
for
which
the
fee
is
based.
The
bill
19


requires
that
a

20


including

schedule
27


each
year.
Following
a
review,

council
or

28


of
supervisors
shall
amend
the
ordinance
to
update
the
fee
29


schedule
and

“actual
cost”
to

only
those
expenses
31


directly
attributable
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
fee
is
32


collected
and
shall
not
include
costs
such
as
employment
33


benefits,
depreciation,
maintenance,
utilities,
or
insurance
34


associated
with
