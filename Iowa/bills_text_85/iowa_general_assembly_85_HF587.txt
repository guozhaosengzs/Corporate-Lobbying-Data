A

metal
license

8


The
bill
requires
that
the
labor
services
division
of
9


the
department
of
workforce
development
and
the
department
10


of
public
health
develop
a
plan
to
combine
the
contractor
11


registration
and
contractor
licensing
application
process
12


for
contractors
licensed
under
Code
chapter
105,
to
be
13


implemented
in
time
for

renewals
due
July

2017.
14


The
department
of
public
health
shall
transfer
to
the

services
division
a
portion
of
each

license
fee
16


equal

three
times
the
current
contractor
registration
17


fee.
Effective
July

a
contractor
licensed
under
Code
18


chapter
105
shall
register
as
a
contractor
under
Code
chapter
19


91C.
20


The
bill
adds
“sheet
metal”
to
the
list
of
licensed
21


professionals.
The
term
includes
heating,
ventilation,
air
22


conditioning,
pollution
control,
fume
hood
systems,
and
related
23


ducted
systems.
24


The
bill
requires
that
the
board
adopt
the
most
current
25


version
of
the
uniform
plumbing
code
and
the
international
26


mechanical
code.
Local
jurisdictions
must
comply
with
the
27


state
plumbing
code
and
state
mechanical
code,
as
provided
for
28


in
the
bill,
by
December
31,
2015.
However,
the
bill
provides
29


that
the
board
and
local
jurisdictions
may
adopt
standards
that
30


are
more
restrictive.
31


The
bill
requires
that
the
board

an
industry
32


standardized

create
an
examination
for
the
specified
license
type.
1


The
bill
requires
that
an
apprentice
work
under
the
direct
2


supervision
of
an
appropriately
licensed
journeyperson
or
3


master
who
is
on
the
same
job
site.
4


The
bill
provides
that
an
individual
who
has
passed
both
5


the
journeyperson
HVAC-refrigeration
examination
and
the
6


journeyperson
hydronic
examination
separately
shall
be
7


issued
a
journeyperson
mechanical
license
without
having
to
8


pass
an
examination.
An
individual
who
has
passed
both
the

be
issued
a

license
without
having
to
pass
an
examination.
12


Relating
to
the
use
of
master
license
numbers
in
13


advertising,
the
bill
requires
a
contractor
license
number,
14


instead
of
master
license
number,
in
written
advertisements
and
15


also
eliminates
a
current
provision
that
prohibited
the
use
of
16


a
master’s
license
number
in
connection
with
the
advertising
17


for
more
than
one
person
engaged
in
the
business.
18


The
bill
repeals,
effective
December
31,
2016,
the
19


requirement
that
the
board
notify
each
licensee
by
mail
at
20


least
60
days
before
the
licensee’s
license

with
an

date
of
June
30,
2017,
29


and
