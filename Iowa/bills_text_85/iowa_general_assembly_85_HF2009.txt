EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


This
bill
appropriates
funds
to
the
department
on
aging
14


for
FY
2014-2015
for
administration
of
the
office
of
15


substitute
decision
maker
on
a
statewide
basis.
The
office
16


was
established
in
2005,
was
partially
funded
in
2007,
and
was
17


discontinued
due
to
budget
reductions
in
2009.
The
office
of
18


substitute
decision
maker
provides
a
public
substitute
decision
19


maker
(guardian,
conservator,
attorney-in-fact
under
a
power
20


of
attorney,
or
a
representative
payee)
to
assist
those
with
21


limited
or
no
decision-making
capabilities
to
make
personal
22


care
and
financial
decisions.
The
public
substitute
decision
23


maker
is
a
decision
maker
of
last
resort
and
acts
only
when
24


there
is
no
willing
and
responsible
person
available
to
serve
25


as
a
private
substitute
decision
maker
or
the
adult
is
without
26


adequate
resources
to
compensate
a
private
decision
maker.
