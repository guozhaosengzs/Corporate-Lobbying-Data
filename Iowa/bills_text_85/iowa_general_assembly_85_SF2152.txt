A

Legislative
intent.
14


The
general
assembly
recognizes
the
need
for
a
person
to
have
15


the
freedom
to
choose
the
manner,
cost,
and
setting
for
giving
16


birth.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
access
to
prenatal
care
17


and
delivery
services
is
limited
by
the
inadequate
number
of
18


providers
of
such
services
and
that
the
practice
of
midwifery
19


may
help
to
reduce
this
shortage.
The
general
assembly
also
20


recognizes
the
need
for
the
safe
and
effective
delivery
of
21


newborn
babies
and
the
health,
safety,
and
welfare
of
their
22


mothers
in
the
delivery
process.
The
general
assembly,
in
23


the
interest
of
public
health,
promotes
the
regulation
of
the
24


practice
of
midwifery
in
Iowa
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
25


health
and
welfare
of
women
and
infants.
The
general
assembly
26


recognizes
that
midwifery
is
a
profession
in
its
own
right
and
27


that
it
is
not
the
practice
of
medicine
or
nursing.
