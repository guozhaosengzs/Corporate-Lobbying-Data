and

EXPLANATION
28


This
bill
creates
a
new
Code
chapter
91F
that

employer
to

with
appropriate
meal
and

shall
be
not
32


less
than
30
minutes
during
an
employee’s
work

more
than
seven
hours,
between
the
third
and
sixth
hours.
1


The
bill
states
that
an
appropriate
rest
break
shall
be
not
2


less
than
10
minutes
during
each
four-hour
work
period.
The
3


rest
break
is
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
work
period.
The
rest
4


break
is
in
addition
to
the
meal
break
and
cannot
be
added
to
5


the
meal
break
or
deducted
from
the
work
period
to
reduce
the
6


overall
length
of
the
total
work
period.
7


The
bill
defines
an
“employee”
as
a
natural
person
who
is
8


employed
in
this
state
for
wages
by
an
employer.
An
“employer”
9


is
defined
as
a
person,
as
defined
in
Code
section
4.1,
who
10


employs
a
natural
person
for
wages.
11


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
is
not
required
to
pay
for
12


a
meal
break
if
an
employee
is
free
from
work
duties
during
the
13


employee’s
entire
meal
break.
14


The
bill
allows
three
exemptions
to
the
meal
and
rest
break
15


requirements.
The
first
exemption
is
if
the
meal
and
rest
16


break
requirements
are
modified
by
the
terms
of
a
collective
17


bargaining
agreement.
However,
the
exemption
is
valid
only
18


if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
the
19


employees
prescribes
specific
terms
concerning
meal
and
rest
20


breaks.
21


The
second
exemption
states
that
meal
and
rest
break
22


requirements
apply
to
hourly
paid
and
salary-paid
employees.
23


However,
management
or
employees
involved
in
certain
24


agricultural
jobs
are
not
required
to
have
meal
or
rest
breaks.
25


The
third
exemption
is
when
an
employer
can
show
that
the
26


ordinary
nature
and
circumstance
of
the
work
prevented
the
27


employer
from
establishing
and
maintaining
a
regular
scheduled
28


meal
break.
29


The
bill
provides
civil
penalties
for
violating
the
new
30


Code
chapter.
An
employer
who
violates
the
provisions
shall
31


be
subject
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
$100
for
each
violation.
The
32


labor
commissioner
may
recover
the
penalties
under
Code
chapter
33


17A
contested
case
procedures.
Any
penalties
recovered
shall
34


be
deposited
in
the
general
fund
of
the
state.
