EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
involves
provisions
relating
to
Medicaid
home
and
3


community-based
services
(HCBS)
waivers.
4


The
bill
amends
a
provision
in
the
health
facilities
5


licensing
chapter
(Code
chapter
135C)
that
provides
an
6


exemption
from
licensing
as
a
health
care
facility
for
certain
7


residential
programs
to
which
the
department
of
human
services
8


(DHS)
applies
accreditation,
certification,
or
standards
of
9


review.
The
bill
broadens
the
exemption
for
residential
10


programs
that
provide
care
to
not
more
than
five
individuals
11


that
are
approved
by
DHS
to
receive
moneys
under
an
HCBS
12


waiver,
by
removing
the
limitation
to
only
HCBS
waivers
for
13


persons
with
intellectual
disabilities
and
instead
providing
14


for
application
of
the
exemption
to
residential
programs
15


approved
by
DHS
to
receive
moneys
under
HCBS
habilitation
or
16


waiver
programs.
17


The
bill
also
amends
a
provision
in
2010
Iowa
Acts
relating
18


to
evaluation
of
Medicaid
HCBS
waiver
payments,
to
instead
19


require
that
DHS
evaluate
utilization
data
and
determine
the
20


proper
mechanism
to
trigger
a
review
of
medical
necessity
for
21


services
provided
under
each
home
and
community-based
services
22


waiver.
Following
evaluation
of
the
utilization
data
and
23


determination
of
the
trigger
mechanism,
DHS
is
required
to
24


notify
affected
providers
at
least
60
days
prior
to
applying
25


the
trigger
mechanism.
Following
provision
of
the
notice,
26


DHS
is
to
require
advance
approval
for
services
for
which
27


utilization
is
projected
to
exceed
the
trigger
mechanism.
