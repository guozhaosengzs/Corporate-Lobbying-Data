EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
driving
a
motor
vehicle
22


while
using
a
mobile
telephone
unless
the
mobile
telephone
23


is
specifically
designed
and
configured
to
allow
hands-free
24


listening
and
talking
and
is
used
in
that
manner.
The
bill
25


does
not
apply
to
the
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle
when
the
motor
26


vehicle
is
at
a
complete
stop
off
the
roadway.
In
addition,
27


the
bill
exempts
the
following
persons
from
the
prohibition:
a
28


member
of
a
public
safety
agency
performing
official
duties;
29


a
health
care
professional
in
the
course
of
an
emergency
30


situation;
and
a
person
receiving
safety-related
information
31


including
emergency,
traffic,
or
weather
alerts.
These
are
the
32


same
exemptions
that
currently
apply
under
Iowa
law
prohibiting
33


text-messaging
while
driving.
34


The
bill
defines
“mobile
telephone”
to
mean
the
same
35


-3-


LSB
1524YH
(5)

dea/nh

H.F.
412


as
defined
in
federal
motor
carrier
safety
administration
1


regulations.
Under
that
definition,
“mobile
telephone”
means
2


a
mobile
communication
device
that
falls
under
or
uses
any
3


commercial
mobile
radio
service,
as
defined
in
regulations
of
4


the
federal
communications
commission.
The
federal
definition
5


explicitly
excludes
two-way
or
citizens
band
radio
services.
6


The
bill
amends
current
provisions
prohibiting
7


text-messaging
while
driving
to
specify
that
a
person
does
not
8


violate
the
text-messaging
provisions
by
using
a
fixed
unit
9


global
positioning
system
or
navigation
system.
“Fixed
unit
10


global
positioning
system
or
navigation
system”
is
defined
as
11


an
electronic
device
mounted
inside
a
motor
vehicle
and
capable
12


of
providing
navigation
directions
to
a
driver
based
on
data
13


entered
into
the
device
prior
to
operating
the
motor
vehicle.
14


The
bill
also
strikes
a
current
exception
to
the
prohibition
15


on
text-messaging
while
driving
which
applies
to
a
person
16


selecting
or
entering
a
telephone
number
or
name
in
a
hand-held
17


mobile
telephone
or
activating,
deactivating,
or
initiating
a
18


function
of
a
hand-held
mobile
telephone.
19


The
penalties
established
in
the
bill
mirror
the
penalties
20


currently
applicable
for
text-messaging
while
driving.
A
21


person
who
uses
a
mobile
telephone
while
driving
in
violation
22


of
the
bill
commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
23


a
scheduled
fine
of
$30.
The
offense
is
not
a
moving
24


violation,
and
therefore
cannot
be
considered
for
purposes
of
25


administrative
suspension
of
a
driver’s
license
or
to
establish
26


habitual
offender
status.
However,
if
the
violation
causes
a
27


serious
injury,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
28


or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
29


days,
or
both.
If
the
violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
30


impose
an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
31


driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or
both.
32


The
ban
on
the
use
of
a
hand-held
mobile
telephone
while
33


driving
is
enforceable
only
as
a
secondary
action
when
a
driver
34


has
been
stopped
or
detained
for
a
suspected
violation
of
