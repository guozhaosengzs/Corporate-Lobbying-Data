injured
employee
under

bill
gives
an
employee
the
right
to
predesignate
32


a
physician
who
is
a
primary
care
provider,
from

treatment
for
a
work-related

The
employer

written
notice
to
employees
of
this
right
upon
hire,
2


periodically
during
employment,
and
upon
receiving
notice
of
an
3


injury
from
an
employee,
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
the
workers’
4


compensation
commissioner.

If
the
employer
fails
to
provide
such
notification,
an
6


injured
employee
has
the
right
to
choose
any
physician
to
7


provide
treatment
for
the
work-related
injury
and
that
8


treatment
shall
be
considered

9


If
the
employer
or

10


chosen
by
the
other
party,
the
dissatisfied
party
is
required
11


to
communicate
the
basis

other
12


party
in

to
such
alternate
care,
the
dissatisfied
party
may
make
15


an
application
for
alternate
care
to
the
commissioner.
16


An
application
for

is
an
original
proceeding
17


and
is
treated
as
a
contested
case.
A
party
may
request

conference
22


hearing
and

days
of

23


Code
section

24


employee
has
chosen
care,
when
it
is
medically
indicated
that
25


no
significant

is
anticipated,
the
26


employee
may
obtain
a
medical
opinion
regarding
the
extent
of
27


the
employee’s
permanent
disability.
If
the
employer
believes
28


that
the
evaluation
of
permanent
disability
obtained
by
the
29


employee
is
too
high,
the
employer
has
the
right
to
obtain
30


another
medical
opinion
from
a
physician
of
the
employer’s
31


choosing.
32


The
