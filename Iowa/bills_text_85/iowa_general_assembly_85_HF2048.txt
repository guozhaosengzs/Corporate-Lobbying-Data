the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
eminent
domain
authority
2


and
procedures
and
makes
appropriations
for
certain
passenger
3


rail
activities.
4


Division
I
of
the
bill
provides
that
property
listed
on
the
5


state
register
of
historic
places
shall
not
be
removed
from
6


the
register
solely
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
property
7


to
be
acquired
by
condemnation
unless
the
condemnation
is
8


undertaken
by
the
department
of
transportation.
The
bill
also
9


provides
that
property
on
the
state
register
of
historic
places
10


may
not
be
condemned
unless
a
joint
resolution
authorizing
11


the
condemnation
is
approved
by
a
vote
of
at
least
two-thirds
12


of
each
house
of
the
general
assembly
and
signed
by
the
13


governor.
This
approval
procedure,
however,
does
not
apply
to
14


a
condemnation
undertaken
by
the
department
of
transportation.
15


Division
I
of
the
bill
specifies
that
Code
chapter
6A,
unless
16


specifically
provided
by
law,
is
not
to
be
construed
to
limit
17


or
otherwise
affect
the
application
of
Code
chapters
478
and
18


479
to
the
eminent
domain
authority
of
the
utilities
division
19


of
the
department
of
commerce.
20


Division
I
of
the
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
eminent
21


domain
authority
in
relation
to
development
or
creation
of
22


a
lake.
The
bill
provides
that
when
determining
the
number
23


of
acres
justified
as
reasonable
and
necessary
for
a
surface
24


drinking
water
source,
the
registered
professional
engineers
25


may,
if
appropriate,
employ
standards
or
guidelines
other
26


than
the
guidelines
of
the
United
States
natural
resource
27


conservation
service.
The
bill
requires
the
data
and
28


information
used
by
the
registered
professional
engineers
29


to
include
data
and
information
relating
to
population
and
30


commercial
enterprise
activity
for
the
area
from
the
two
most
31


recent
federal
decennial
censuses
unless
the
district
court
of
32


the
county
in
which
the
property
is
situated
has
determined
33


by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
such
data
would
not
34


accurately
predict
the
population
and
commercial
enterprise

area
in
the
future.
1


Division
I
of
the
bill
also
provides
that
a
second
review
2


or
analysis
of
the
drinking
water
capacity
needs
shall
be
3


performed
upon
receipt
by
the
acquiring
agency
of
a
petition
4


signed
by
not
less
than
25
percent
of
the
affected
property
5


owners.
The
registered
professional
engineer
to
perform
the
6


second
review
or
analysis
shall
be
selected
by
a
committee
7


appointed
by
the
affected
property
owners
and
comprised
of
8


at
least
50
percent
property
owners
affected
by
the
proposed
9


condemnation
action.
The

10


the
acquiring
agency
shall
pay
for
the
services
of
such
an
11


engineer.
12


Division
I
of
the
bill
provides

the
plans,
analyses,
applications,
including
any
application
15


for
funding,
and
other
planning
activities
of
the
acquiring

not
include
or
provide
for
the
use
of
the
lake
for
17


recreational
purposes.
18


Division
I
of
the
bill
adds
reasonable

and
19


reasonable

that
are
attributable
to
certain

relating
to
the
creation
of
a
lake,
up
to
$100,000,
21


to
the

of
expenses
reimbursable
by
an
acquiring
agency
to
22


a
property
owner.
23


Division
I
of
the
bill
provides
that
when
two

24


elapsed
since

was
condemned
for
the
creation
of
a
25


lake
and
the
property
has
not
been
used
for
or
construction
26


has
not
progressed
substantially
for
the
purpose
stated
in
the
27


application,
and
the
acquiring
agency
has
not
taken
action
to
28


dispose
of
the

pursuant
to
Code
section
6B.56,
the

offering
the

If

time
period,
33


the
prior
owner
may

to
the
