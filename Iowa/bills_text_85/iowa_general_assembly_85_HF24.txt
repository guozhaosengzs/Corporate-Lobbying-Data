EXPLANATION
5


Under
current
law,
golf
carts
may
be
operated
on
certain
city
6


streets
if
approved
by
the
governing
body
of
the
incorporated
7


area.
Golf
carts
may
not
be
operated
on
a
primary
road
8


extension
within
the
city
except
to
cross
the
primary
road
9


extension,
and
golf
cart
operation
is
only
allowed
from
sunrise
10


to
sunset.
The
person
operating
the
golf
cart
must
have
a
11


valid
driver’s
license
and
the
golf
cart
must
be
equipped
with
12


a
slow
moving
vehicle
sign,
a
bicycle
safety
flag,
and
adequate
13


brakes.
The
governing
body
may
impose
additional
safety
14

15


This
bill
allows
a
county
board
of
supervisors
to
allow
16


the
operation
of
golf
carts
on
the
streets
of
an
established
17


community
within
an
unincorporated
area.
The
bill
defines
18


“established
community”
to
mean
an
area
designated
by
the
19


board
of
supervisors
which
is
the
same
or
substantially
the
20


same
as
an
area
identified
by
the
United
States
census
bureau
21


as
a
census
designated
place
as
of
the
most
recent
decennial
22


census.
Census
designated
places
are
statistical
counterparts
23


of
incorporated
places
and
contain
settled
concentrations
of
24


population
which
are
identifiable
by
name.
Under
the
bill,
25


golf
cart
operation
in
an
established
community
within
an
26


unincorporated
area
is
subject
to
the
same
licensing
and
safety
27


equipment
requirements
currently
applicable
to
the
operation
of
28


golf
carts
in
cities.
Golf
carts
are
not
permitted
on
primary
29


roads
within
an
unincorporated
area,
except
to
cross
a
segment
30


of
a
primary
road
located
within
the
established
community
31


where
golf
cart
operation
is
allowed.
The
bill
specifies
that
32


in
cities
and
unincorporated
areas
where
golf
cart
operation
is
33


allowed,
it
may
only
take
place
between
sunrise
and
sunset.
