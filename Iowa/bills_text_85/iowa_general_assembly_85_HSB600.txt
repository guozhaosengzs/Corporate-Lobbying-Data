corporation
law
is
32


contained
in
Code
chapter
490
(1989
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
288),
33


the

Business
Corporation
Act”
(Code
section
490.101).

All
domestic
for-profit
corporations

that
chapter,
unless
an
express
exception
is
provided.
One
1


exception
involves
a
corporation
organized
under
Code
chapter
2


491
which
governs
corporations
incorporated
prior
to
July
1,
3


1971.
That
Code
chapter
expressly
provides
that
all
domestic
4


corporations
are
to
be
organized
under
Code
chapter
490,
unless
5


expressly
allowed
in
that
Code
chapter.
The
transitional
6


provision
in
Code
chapter
490
allows
a
corporation
organized
7


under
Code
chapter
491
to
remain
governed
under
that
Code
8


chapter,
if
organized
on
the
mutual
plan
or
operating
as
9


a
telephone
company
qualifying
as
a
nonprofit
corporation
10


pursuant
to
an
internal
revenue
service
letter
ruling
and
if
11


it
distributes
profits
in
a
manner
similar
to
a
cooperative
12


association
under
Code
chapter
499.
For
example,
certain
13


corporations
formed
for
purposes
of
insurance
may
be
governed
14


under
Code
chapter
490
(Code
section
515.1).
15


CURRENT
LAW
——
PUBLICATION
REQUIREMENTS.
A
corporation
16


organized
under
Code
chapter
491
is
governed
by
its
articles
of
17


incorporation
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
who
issues
a
18


certificate
of
incorporation
to
the
corporation
(Code
section
19


491.19).
The
corporation
must
publish
a
detailed
notice
of
20


the
incorporation
in
a
newspaper
(Code
sections
491.17
through
21


491.19).
In
addition,
when
the
corporation
amends
its
articles
22


of
incorporation,
the
amendments
are
valid
only
when
filed
with
23


the
secretary
of
state
and
published
in
a
newspaper
in
the
same
24


manner
required
for
the
original
corporation
(Code
section
25


491.20).
A
corporation
organized
under
the
Code
chapter
may
26


also
have
a
limited
duration
(Code
section
491.24)
but
can
27


be
renewed
(Code
section
491.25).
Upon
satisfying
certain
28


conditions,
the
secretary
of
state
issues
the
corporation
a
29


certificate
of
renewal
(Code
section
491.28).
The
corporation
30


must
publish
a
notice
of
renewal
in
the
same
manner
as
it
31


published
the
notice
of
incorporation
(Code
section
491.32).
32


Two
or
more
corporations
organized
under
Code
chapter
491
33


may
merge
so
that
the
surviving
corporation
absorbs
another
34


corporation
or
alternatively,
two
corporations
may
consolidate

to
form
a
new
corporation
(Code
chapter
491,
division
II).
The

merged
or
consolidated
corporation
must
file
articles
of
merger
2


or
consolidation
with
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
3


491.107).
In
that
case,
notice
of
the
merger
or
consolidation
4


is
again
published
in
the
same
manner
as
the
original
articles
5


(Code
section
491.109).
A
corporation
organized
under
Code
6


chapter
491
that
dissolves
must
publish
a
notice
of
the
7


dissolution
and
file
a
proof
of
publication
with
the
secretary
8


of
state
(Code
section
491.23).

BILL’S
PROVISIONS.

bill
provides
that
a
corporation
10


organized
under

chapter
491
prior
to
July
1,
1971,
and
11


which
is
allowed
to
continue
its
existence,
may

its

another
corporation,

dissolve
without
having
to
publish
a
notice
of
its
action
in
