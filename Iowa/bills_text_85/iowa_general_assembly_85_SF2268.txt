For
those
three
budget
years,
a
school
district
is
20


eligible

in
21


the

programming
provided
by
a
school
district
in

year
over

24


The
base
incentive
enrollment
is
the
average
of
the

enrollments
of
eligible

received
by

14


deemed
to
constitute

compliance
with

15


funding-related
requirements
of
Code

The

inclusion
of
