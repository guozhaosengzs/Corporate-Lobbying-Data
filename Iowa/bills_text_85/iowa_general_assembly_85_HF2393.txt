for

2


personal

information
for

At

database
and
compare
current
motor
vehicle
registrations
with
7


updated
insurance

The
files
in
the
database
shall
8


be
archived
semiannually
and
audited

the
department
at
least
9


annually.
The
bill
requires
the

rules
for

11


If

vehicle
12


is
not
covered
under
an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance
13


for
three
months,
the
designated
agent
shall
send
a
notice
to
14


the
owner
requiring
the
owner
to
respond
within
15
days
by
15


providing
proof
of
financial
liability
coverage
or
proof
that
16


the
owner
is
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
maintain
financial
17


liability
coverage.
If
the
owner
fails
to
respond,
a
second

If
the

does
not

27


Any
fees
in

of
the

administration
of
28


the

be
transferred
to
the
road
use
tax
fund
29


annually

The

if
a
motor

32


policy,
that
fact
shall
be
noted

assessed
a

each
day
the
20


insurer
fails

comply.
However,
the

may
waive

the

upon
a
showing

22


accidental,
or
the
