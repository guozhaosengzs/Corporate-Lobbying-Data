This
bill
relates
to
changes
to
the
job
training
program
and

fund
under
Code
chapter
260F.
The
bill
amends
the
transfer
of
8


moneys
from
the
workforce
development
fund
to
the
job
training
9


fund
and
makes
an
appropriation.
The
bill
is
titled
the
“Iowa
10


Apprenticeship
and
Job
Training
Act”.
11


The
bill
amends
the
parties
to
the
agreements
under
the
job
12


training
program
and
the
distribution
of
funds
from
the
job
13


training
fund.
Currently,
a
community
college
and
a
business
14


enter
into
an
agreement
concerning
a
training
arrangement.
The
15


bill
provides
instead
that
a
community
college
or
the
economic
16


development
authority
shall
enter
into
an
agreement
with
an
17


eligible
business
concerning
the
training
arrangement
focused
18


on
meeting
the
workforce
needs
of
the
eligible
business.
19


This
training
may
occur
through
adult
basic
education,
20


on-the-job
training,
job-related
instruction,
vocation
and
21


skill-assessment
services
and
testing,
tuition
and
classroom
22


instruction
for
coursework
at
community
colleges
or
regents
23


institutions,
and
training
equipment,
supplies
and
materials.
24


The
job
training
fund
currently
is
established
in
the
25


authority
in
the
workforce
development
fund
and
the
authority
26


makes
funds
available
to
the
community
colleges
by
formula.
27


The
bill
provides
that
the
job
training
fund
is
created
in
the
28


state
treasury
rather
than
within
the
workforce
development
29


fund.
The
bill
transfers
any
appropriation
provided
for
30


purposes
of
the
chapter
from
the
workforce
development
fund
31


to
the
job
training
fund
rather
than
allocating
$4
million
32


for
the
purposes
of
Code
chapter
260F.
The
bill
also
changes
33


language
from
mandatory
to
permissive
regarding
the
requirement
34


of

from

project
pursuant
to

chapter
260F.
The
bill
also
states
1


that
50
percent
of
the
moneys
in
the
job
training
fund
is
2


allocated
for
financial
assistance
to
eligible
businesses
3


and
50
percent
of
the
moneys
in
the
job
training
fund
is
4


allocated
for
financial
assistance
to
apprenticeship
programs.
5


However,
repayments
or
recaptures
of
financial
assistance
to
6


eligible
businesses
must
be
allocated
for
purposes
of
providing
7


financial
assistance
for
eligible
businesses.
The
bill
8


provides
that
the
authority
may
not
expend
more
than
2
percent
9


of
moneys
in
the
fund
for
administrative
purposes.
The
bill
10


also
provides
that
a
community
college
may
retain
not
more
than
11


5
percent
of
moneys
disbursed
for
administrative
costs.
12


In
the
job
training
Code
chapter,
the
bill
transfers
the
13


substance
of
the
definition
of
an
eligible
business
into
its
14


own
Code
section.
In
this
Code
chapter,
the
bill
also
adds
15


definitions
for
“apprentice”,
“apprenticeable
occupation”,
16


“apprenticeship
program”,
“apprenticeship

used
to
provide
financial

26


to
businesses
whose

for

The

agreement
with
the
authority.
The
bill
also
provides
what
type
1


of
financial
assistance
may
be
offered
dependent
upon
the
type
2


of
training
provided.
Financial
assistance
is
generally
in
the
3


form
of
a

in
an
amount
equal
to
100
percent
of
the
cost
4


of
the
project
with
required
future
repayment
of
50
percent
5


at
0
percent
interest.
However,
if
the
training
is
provided
6


by
a
statewide
industry
association
that
facilitates
training
7


utilizing
industry-recognized
standards
resulting
in
portable
8


credentials
for
the
skilled
trade,
the
financial
assistance
is
9


in
the
form
of
a
grant
or
forgivable
loan
in
an
amount
equal
10


to
100
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
training
costs
incurred.
11


Financial
assistance
for
a
project
conducted
by
community
12


college
faculty
or
staff
at
the
community
college
is
also
in
13


the
form
of
a
grant
or
forgivable
loan
in
an
amount
equal
to
100
14


percent
of
the
cost
of
the
project.
15


The
bill
also
provides
that
an
apprenticeship
sponsor
or
16


lead
apprenticeship
sponsor,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
may
apply
17


for
financial
assistance
when
that
sponsor
is
conducting
18


apprenticeship
programs
in
Iowa
for
apprentices
who
will
be
19


employed
at
Iowa
worksites.
The
bill
specifies
that
financial
20


assistance
is
to
be
allocated
to
apprenticeship
sponsors
or
21


lead
apprenticeship
sponsors
by
the
ratio
of
the
total
number
22


of
apprentices
trained
and
number
of
contact
hours
for
an
23


apprenticeship
sponsor
or
lead
apprenticeship
sponsor
divided
24


by
the
total
number
of
apprentices
trained
and
contact
hours
25


for
all
the
apprenticeship
sponsors
or
lead
apprenticeship
26


sponsors
in
the
previous
training
year,
then
multiplied
by
the
27


moneys
allocated
for
financial
assistance
to
apprenticeship
28


sponsors.
The
bill
provides
that
in
order
to
receive
financial
29


assistance,
the
apprenticeship
sponsor
or
lead
apprenticeship
30


sponsor
and
the
authority
must
enter
into
an
agreement.
31


The
bill
repeals
Code
sections
relating
to
the
authority’s
32


duty
to
coordinate
the
job
training
program
and
allocation
of
33


funding
to
community
colleges
as
that
no
longer
applies
to
the
34


newly
required
agreements
and
available
funding.
