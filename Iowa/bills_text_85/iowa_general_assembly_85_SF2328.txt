16.4A
Legislative
findings
——


agricultural
development.


The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
all
of
the


following:


1.
There
exists
a
serious
problem
in
this
state
regarding


the
ability
of
nonestablished
farmers
to
acquire
agricultural


land
and
agricultural
improvements
and
depreciable
agricultural


property
in
order
to
enter
farming.


2.
This
barrier
to
entry
into
farming
is
conducive
to


consolidation
of
acreage
of
agricultural
land
with
fewer


individuals
resulting
in
a
grave
threat
to
the
traditional


family
farm.


3.
These
conditions
result
in
a
loss
in
population,


unemployment,
and
a
movement
of
persons
from
rural
communities


to
urban
areas
accompanied
by
added
costs
to
communities
for


creation
of
new
public
facilities
and
services.


4.
One
major
cause
of
this
condition
has
been
recurrent


shortages
of
funds
in
private
channels
and
the
high
interest


cost
of
borrowing.


5.
These
shortages
and
costs
have
made
the
sale
and


purchase
of
agricultural
land
to
beginning
farmers
a
virtual


impossibility
in
many
parts
of
the
state.


6.
The
ordinary
operations
of
private
enterprise
have
not
in


the
past
corrected
these
conditions.


7.
A
stable
supply
of
adequate
funds
for
agricultural


financing
is
required
to
encourage
beginning
farmers
in


an
orderly
and
sustained
manner
and
to
reduce
the
problems


described
in
this
section
.


8.
Article
IX,
2nd
subarticle,
section
3,
of
the


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
requires
that,
“The


General
Assembly
shall
encourage,
by
all
suitable
means,
the


promotion
of
intellectual,
scientific,
moral,
and
agricultural


improvement,”
and
agricultural
improvement
and
the
public
good


are
served
by
a
policy
of
facilitating
access
to
capital
by


beginning
farmers
unable
to
obtain
capital
elsewhere
in
order


to
preserve,
encourage,
and
protect
the
family
farm
which
has


been
the
economic,
political,
and
social
backbone
of
rural


Iowa.


9.
It
is
necessary
to
create
a
program
to
encourage


ownership
of
farms
by
beginning
farmers
by
providing
purchase


money
loans
to
beginning
farmers
who
are
not
able
to
obtain






Senate
File

p.
12


adequate
capital
elsewhere
to
provide
such
funds
and
to
lower


costs
through
the
use
of
public
financing.


10.
There
exists
a
serious
problem
in
this
state
regarding


the
ability
of
farmers
to
obtain
affordable
operating
loans
for


reasonable
and
necessary
expenses
and
cash
flow
requirements


of
farming.


11.
Farming
is
one
of
the
principal
pursuits
of
the


inhabitants
of
this
state.
Many
other
industries
and
pursuits,


in
turn,
are
wholly
dependent
upon
farming.


12.
The
inability
of
farmers
to
obtain
affordable
operating


loans
is
conducive
to
a
general
decline
of
the
economy
in
this


state.


13.
A
serious
problem
continues
to
exist
in
this
state


regarding
the
ability
of
agricultural
producers
to
obtain,


retain,
restructure,
or
service
loans
or
other
financing
on


a
reasonable
and
affordable
basis
for
operating
expenses,


cash
flow
requirements,
and
capital
asset
acquisition
or


maintenance.


14.
Because
the
Iowa
economy
is
dependent
upon
the


production
and
marketing
of
agricultural
produce,
the
inability


of
agricultural
producers
to
obtain,
retain,
restructure,


or
service
loans
or
other
financing
on
a
reasonable
and


an
affordable
basis
for
operating
expenses,
cash
flow


requirements,
or
capital
asset
acquisition
or
maintenance


contributes
to
a
general
decline
of
the
state’s
economy.

for
each


tax
year
that

is
allowed.


(2)
If
the
qualified
beginning
farmer
is
a
veteran,
the


taxpayer
may
claim
eight
percent
of
the
gross
amount
paid
to


the
taxpayer
under
the
agreement
for
the
first
year
that
the


tax
credit
is
allowed
and
seven
percent
of
the
gross

the
taxpayer
for
each
subsequent
tax
year
that
the

paid

agreement
or

same


parties.


b.

be
computed
as
follows:

If
the
qualified
beginning
farmer

animals
sold


under

payment
is
exclusively
made

for
each
subsequent
tax
year
that
the

is
allowed
the
tax
credit.
However,
the

claim
seventeen
percent
of

the
authority
may


elect
an
alternative
method
to
compute
a
tax
credit
for
a
lease


based
on
a
crop
share
basis.
The
alternative
method
shall


utilize
a
formula
which
uses
data
compiled
by
the
United
States


department
of
agriculture.
The
formula
shall
calculate
the


amount
of
the
tax
credit
by
multiplying
the
average
per
bushel


yield
for
the
same
type
of
grain
as
produced
under
the
lease


in
the
same
county
where
the
leased
land
is
located
by
a
per


bushel
state
price
established
for
such
type
of
grain
harvested


the
previous
fall.

credit
in
excess

the
tax
year
may
be
credited
to
the
tax
liability
for
the


following
five
years
or
until
depleted,
whichever
is
earlier.


A
tax
credit
shall
not
be
carried
back
to
a
tax
year
prior
to


the
tax
year
in
which
the
taxpayer
redeems
the
tax
credit.
A


tax

be
transferable
to
any
other
person
other


than
the
taxpayer’s
estate
or
trust
upon
the
taxpayer’s
death.

taxpayer
shall
not
claim
a
tax
credit
under
this

required
for
an


original

However,

shall
not

is
any
of

c.
The
beginning
farmer
is
responsible
for
managing
or


maintaining
agricultural

that
are
greater
than
necessary
to
adequately
support
a


beginning
farmer
as
determined
by
the
authority
according
to


rules
which
shall
be
adopted
by
the
authority.


d.
The
agricultural
assets
are
being
leased
or
rented
at


a
rate
which
is
substantially
higher
or
lower
than
the

rate
for
similar
agricultural

leased
or
rented
within


the
same
community,
as
determined
by

9.

the
authority
shall
not
issue
a


tax
credit
certificate
to
the

for
a
subsequent
tax


year
based
on
the
approved

Any
prior
tax
credit


is
allowed
as
provided
in
this
section.
The
taxpayer
may


apply
for
and
be
issued
another
tax
credit
certificate
for
the


same
agricultural
assets
as
provided
in
this
section
for
any


remaining
tax

for
which
a

was
not
issued.


b.
If
the
authority
determines
that
the
taxpayer
is
at

is
disallowed.
The
tax

If
a

be
conclusively
deemed
at
fault
for
the


termination.
