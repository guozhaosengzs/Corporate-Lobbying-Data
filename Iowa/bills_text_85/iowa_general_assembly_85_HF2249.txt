EXPLANATION
22


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
23


the
explanationâ€™s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
24


This
bill
relates
to
a
cost
containment
strategy
that
25


would
require
transition
under
the
Medicaid
program
of
the
26


provision
by
individual
providers
of
personal
care
under
the
27


consumer-directed
attendant
care
option
to
agency-provided
28


personal
care
services
while
retaining
the
consumer
choice
29


option
for
those
individuals
able
and
desiring
to
self-direct
30


services.
Because
the
provision
was
included
in
the
31


appropriation
for
the
Medicaid
program
for
FY
2013-2014
and
32


continued
in
FY
2014-2015,
the
bill
eliminates
the
initial
33


directive
for
FY
2013-2014,
and
directs
the
department
of
human
34


services
not
to
implement
the
strategy
for
FY
2014-2015.
