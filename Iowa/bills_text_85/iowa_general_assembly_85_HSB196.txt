The

is
5


committed
to
providing

a
safe

6


school
environment
in
which
all

7


are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.
The
general

finds
that
a

environment
is
necessary
9


for

Harassing

behavior

seriously
disrupt

a
safe
and
civil
12


environment,
and
the
ability
of
students
to
learn
and
succeed.
13


Therefore,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
Iowa
that
school
14


employees,
volunteers,
and
students
in
Iowa
schools
shall
not

as
any

act
or
conduct
1


toward
a
student
which
is
based
on
any
actual
or
perceived

trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student
and
which
creates
an
3


objectively
hostile
school
environment
that
meets
certain
4


conditions.
The
bill
distinguishes
these
two
terms.
The
bill
5


defines
“harassment”
as
any
electronic,
written,
verbal,
or
6


physical
act
or
conduct
toward
a
student
which
is
based
on
any
7


actual
or

student
and
8


which
creates
an
objectively
hostile
school
environment
that
9


meets
certain
conditions.
The
bill
defines
“bullying”
as
any
10


electronic,
written,
verbal,
or
physical
act
or
conduct
toward
11


a
student
which
is
based
on
any
reason
other
than
any
actual
12


or
perceived
trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student
and
which
13


creates
an
objectively
hostile
school
environment
that
meets
14


certain
conditions.
15


Under
current
law,
“trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student”
16


is
defined
to
include
but
not
be
limited
to
age,
color,
17


creed,
national
origin,
race,
religion,
marital
status,

or
disability,
ancestry,
political
20


party
preference,

status,
or
21


familial
status.
The
bill
applies
the
definition
to
any
other
22


distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
student.
The
bill
provides
23


that
the
definition
is
not
exhaustive
and
must
be
construed
24


broadly
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
bill.
25


The
bill
adds
social
networking
internet
sites
and
any
other
26


form
of
communication
using
electronic
means
to
the
definition
27


of
“electronic”.
28


Under
current
law,
school
antiharassment
and
antibullying
29


policies
must
prohibit
harassment
and
bullying
in
school,
on
30


school
property,
and
at
any
school
function
or
school-sponsored
31


activity.
The
bill
adds
presence
in
any
vehicle
owned,
leased,
32


provided,
or
hired
by
the
school
and
during
the
use
of
any
33


property
or
