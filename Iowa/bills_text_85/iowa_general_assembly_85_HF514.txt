As

section,
unless
the
context
otherwise


requires:

“Claimant”
means
a
person
who
claims
that
the
person’s


property
was
misappropriated.


b.
“Conveying
customer”
means
a
person
who
delivers
property


into
the
custody
of
a
pawnbroker,
either
by
pawn,
sale,


consignment,
or
trade.


c.
“Misappropriated”
means
stolen,
embezzled,
converted,


or
otherwise
wrongfully
appropriated
against
the
will
of
the


rightful
owner.


2.
To
obtain
possession
of
purchased
or
pledged
goods


held
by
a
pawnbroker
which
a
claimant
claims
to
have
been


misappropriated,
the
claimant
must
notify
the
pawnbroker


by
certified
mail,
return
receipt
requested,
or
in
person


evidenced
by
signed
receipt,
of
the
claimant’s
claim
to
the


purchased
or
pledged
goods.
The
notice
must
contain
a
complete


and
accurate
description
of
the
purchased
or
pledged
goods
and


must
be
accompanied
by
a
legible
copy
of
the
applicable
law


enforcement
agency’s
report
documenting
the
misappropriation


of
the
property.
If
the
claimant
and
the
pawnbroker
do
not


resolve
the
right
to
possession
within
ten
days
after
the


pawnbroker’s
receipt
of
the
notice,
the
claimant
may
petition


the
district
court
sitting
in
small
claims
to
order
the
return


of
the
property,
naming
the
pawnbroker
as
a
defendant,
and


shall
serve
the
pawnbroker
with
a
copy
of
the
petition.
The


pawnbroker
shall
hold
the
property
described
in
the
petition


until
the
right
to
possession
is
resolved
by
the
parties
or
by


the
court.


3.
If,
after
notice
and
a
hearing,
the
court
finds
that


the
property
was
misappropriated
and
orders
the
return
of
the


property
to
the
claimant,
both
of
the
following
shall
apply:


a.
The
claimant
may
recover
from
the
pawnbroker
the
costs


of
the
action.


b.
If
the
conveying
customer
was
convicted
in
a
separate


criminal
proceeding
of
theft
or
dealing
in
stolen
property


involving
the
misappropriated
property,
the
court
shall
order


the
conveying
customer
to
repay
the
pawnbroker
the
full
amount


that
the
conveying
customer
received
from
the
pawnbroker
for


the
property,
plus
all
applicable
pawn
service
charges.
As


used
in
this
paragraph,
“convicted”
includes
a
plea
of
no


contest
to
the
charges
or
any
agreement
in
which
adjudication

File

is
withheld.


4.
If
the
court
finds
that
the
claimant
failed
to
comply


with
the
requirements
of
this
section
or
otherwise
finds


against
the
claimant,
the
claimant
shall
be
liable
for
the


defendant’s
costs.
