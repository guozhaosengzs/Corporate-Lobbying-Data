form.


A

substantially
in
the
following
form
may
be
used
to


create
a
statutory
power
of
attorney
that
has
the
meaning
and


effect
prescribed
by
this
chapter:


IOWA
STATUTORY
POWER
OF
ATTORNEY
FORM


1.
POWER
OF
ATTORNEY


This
power
of
attorney
authorizes
another
person
(your


agent)
to
make
decisions
concerning
your
property
for
you
(the


principal).
Your
agent
will
be
able
to
make
decisions
and
act


with
respect
to
your
property
(including
but
not
limited
to


your
money)
whether
or
not
you
are
able
to
act
for
yourself.


The
meaning
of
authority
over
subjects
listed
on
this
form
is


explained
in
the
Iowa
Uniform
Power
of
Attorney
Act,
Iowa
Code


chapter
633B.


This
power
of
attorney
does
not
authorize
the
agent
to
make


health
care
decisions
for
you.


You
should
select
someone
you
trust
to
serve
as
your
agent.


Unless
you
specify
otherwise,
generally
the
agent’s
authority


will
continue
until
you
die
or
revoke
the
power
of
attorney
or


the
agent
resigns
or
is
unable
to
act
for
you.


Your
agent
is
not
entitled
to
compensation
unless
you
state


otherwise
in
the
optional
Special
Instructions.


This
form
provides
for
designation
of
one
agent.
If
you


wish
to
name
more
than
one
agent,
you
may
name
a
coagent
in
the


optional
Special
Instructions.
Coagents
must
act
by
majority


rule
unless
you
provide
otherwise
in
the
optional
Special


Instructions.


If
your
agent
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
act
for
you,
your


power
of
attorney
will
end
unless
you
have
named
a
successor


agent.
You
may
also
name
a
second
successor
agent.


This
power
of
attorney
becomes
effective
immediately
upon


signature
and
acknowledgment
unless
you
state
otherwise
in
the


optional
Special
Instructions.


If
you
have
questions
about
this
power
of
attorney
or
the


authority
you
are
granting
to
your
agent,
you
should
seek
legal


advice
before
signing
this
form.

AGENT’S
DUTIES


When
you
accept
the

granted

that
continue
until
you
resign
or
the
power
of
attorney


is
terminated
or
revoked.
You
must
do
all
of
the
following:

the

reasonably

with

the


principal’s
expectations,
act
in
the
principal’s
best
interest.


Act
in
good
faith.


Do
nothing
beyond
the
authority
granted
in
this
power
of


attorney.


Disclose
your
identity
as
an

whenever
you
act
for
the


principal
by
writing
or
printing
the
name
of
the
principal
and


signing
your
own
name
as
agent
in
the
following
manner:

all
of
the
following:


Act

diligence.


Keep
a
record
of
all
receipts,
disbursements,

Cooperate
with
any
person
that
has
authority
to
make


health

to
do
what

reasonably
expects
or,

not
know
the

expectations,
to
act
in
the
principal’s
best


interest.


Attempt
to
preserve
the

estate
plan
if

know
the
plan
and
preserving
the
plan
is
consistent
with
the


principal’s
best
interest.


TERMINATION
OF
AGENT’S
AUTHORITY

must
stop
acting
on
behalf
of
the
principal
if
you
learn


of
any
event
that
terminates
this
power
of
attorney
or
your


authority
under
this
