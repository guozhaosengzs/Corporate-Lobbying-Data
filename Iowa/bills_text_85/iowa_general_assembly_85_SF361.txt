DISPOSITION
OF
FAILED
DEVISE.
This
bill
creates
new
Code
9


section
633.273A.
New
subsection
1
codifies
the
common
law
10


concept
of
lapse
that
applies
in
a
situation
where
a
devisee
11


(beneficiary)
named
in
a
will
dies
before
the
testator
(person
12


who
creates
the
will).
In
such
a
situation,
the
testator’s
13


estate
(property)
passes
to
the
testator’s
residuary
estate
14


(any
portion
of
the
testator’s
estate
not
specifically
devised
15


in
a
will).
New
subsection
2
reverses
the
common
law
doctrine
16


of
“no
residue
of
a
residue”
that
addresses
the
situation
17


where
a
residuary
(devisee)
dies
before
the
testator
and
the
18


testator’s
residuary
estate
passes
as
though
the
testator
died
19


intestate
(without
a
will).
The
bill
provides
that
if
the
20


residuary
estate
is
devised
to
two
or
more
devisees
and
one
21


devisee
has
died,
then
the
entire
residuary
estate
is
passed
to
22


the
surviving
residuary
devisee
or
devisees.
These
provisions
23


apply
except
as
provided
in
Code
section
633.273
relating
to
24


devises
to
certain
relatives
of
the
testator
who
survive
the
25


testator
(Iowa’s
anti-lapse
statute)
and
unless
the
terms
of
26


the
will
explicitly
provide
otherwise.
This
provision
applies
27


to
all
decedents
dying
on
or
after
July
1,
2013.
28


SELF-PROVING
WILL
AFFIDAVIT.
The
bill
amends
Code
29


section
633.279,
subsection
2,
relating
to
the
execution
of
a
30


self-proving
will
which
allows
the
testator
and
witnesses
to
31


the
will
to
submit
a
notarized
affidavit.
The
bill
amends
the
32


language
of
the
affidavit
to
make
the
language
consistent
with
33


the
language
of
a
formal
will
execution.
A
conforming
change
34


is
made
to
Code

PETITIONS
FILED
AFTER
DEATH
OF
TESTATOR.
Current
Code
3


section
633.290
provides
that
after
a
testator
(person
who
4


executed
a
will)
dies,
any
interested
person
may
file
a
5


petition
with
the
court
to
admit
the
will
to
probate
or
to
have
6


an
executor
appointed.
The
bill
expands
the
scope
of
this
7


Code
section
to
also
allow
any
interested
person
to
file
a
8


petition
with
the
court
to
request
a
hearing
before
the
will
9


is
admitted
to
probate
or
before
an
executor
is
appointed,
and
10


for
the
production
of
the
decedent’s
purported
will.
Petitions
11


for
any
of
the
reasons
specified
may
be
combined.
The
bill
12


makes
a
conforming
change
to
Code
section
635.1,
relating
to
13


the
administration
of
small
estates.
These
provisions
apply
to
14


petitions
filed
or
after
July
1,
2013.
15


DISTRIBUTION
OF
PROPERTY
BY
AFFIDAVIT.
The
bill
amends
Code
16


section
633.356,
subsection
3,
relating
to
the
distribution
of
17


property
by
affidavit
in
certain
situations
where
the
gross
18


value
of
the
decedent’s
personal
property
that
would
otherwise
19


be
distributed
does
not
exceed
$25,000.
The
bill
adds
the
20


words
“that
would
otherwise
be
distributed
by
will
or
intestate
21


succession”
consistent
with
changes
made
to
