lands.
If
the
finding
of
the
board
22


as
provided
in
section
468.119
was
based
on
the
fact
that
23


additional
lands
are
now
benefited
by
virtue

the
repair,

improvement,
or
the

25


made
to
the
district
and
were
not
benefited
by
the
district
26


as
originally
established,
then
the
board
shall
levy
upon
27


the
annexed
lands
an
assessment
sufficient
to
pay
their


the
28


proportionate
share
of
the
costs
of
the
repair
or
improvement
29


which
was
the
basis
for

lands
being
annexed.

board
finds
that

are
presently
receiving
benefits
31


from
the
district
but
that
some
were
reasonably
omitted
32


from
the
original
establishment
because
of
the
change
of
the
33


topographical
conditions,
the
assessments
levied
upon
the

provisions

chapter

15


EXPLANATION
16


BACKGROUND.
When
a
drainage
or
levee
district
is
first
17


established,
it
is
managed
by
a
board
of
supervisors
in
the
18


county
where
the
district
is
located
or
by
a
joint
board
of
19


supervisors
if
the
district
extends
into
more
than
one
county
20


(Code
chapter
468,
subchapter
I).
After
the
district
has
21


been
established,
the
board
of
supervisors,
or
joint
board
of
22


supervisors,
may
transfer
its
jurisdiction
to
another
governing
23


body,
including
a
three-member
board
of
elected
trustees.
24


MERGER.
This
bill
provides
that
one
or
more
drainage
or
25


levee
districts
may
merge
with
another
levee
or
drainage
26


district
in
such
a
manner
that
the
surviving
drainage
or
levee
27


district
continues
to
exist
and
absorbs
each
old
drainage
28


or
levee
district
which
dissolves.
In
order
for
a
merger
29


to
occur,
the
districts
must
have
adjacent
borders,
the
30


districts
must
include
one
or
more
levees,
and
the
respective
31


boards
of
the
districts
must
determine
that
the
merger
will
32


benefit
their
district’s
landowners.
The
boards
of
each
33


proposed
old
district
and
the
proposed
surviving
district
34


must
conduct
hearings
separately
or
jointly.
If
the
merger
35


-9-


LSB
1111YH
(4)
85


da/sc
9/
11



























H.F.
460


is
approved
by
at
least
one
proposed
old
district
and
the
1


board
of
the
proposed
surviving
district,
the
boards
must
2


meet
jointly
to
vote
for
the
adoption
of
a
merger
resolution.
3


The
effect
of
the
resolution
is
to
transfer
and
vest
to
the
4


surviving
district
title
to
real
estate
or
other
property
5


and
rights-of-way
held
by
an
old
district.
The
surviving
6


district
assumes
all
existing
obligations
of
an
old
district.
7


The
merger
does
not
affect
a
classification
of
land
or
the
8


levy
of
assessments.
The
bill
directs
the
Code
editor
to
9


organize
these
provisions
as
a
new
part
7
of
Code
chapter
468,
10


subchapter
I.
11


BIDDING
PROCEDURES.
A
number
of
provisions
require
12


the
board
to
advertise
for
bids
when
awarding
contracts
to
13


construct
an
improvement
or
make
a
repair.
The
provisions
14


usually
require
the
board
to
publish
a
notice
in
a
newspaper,
15


hold
a
hearing,
opening
bid
responses,
posting
bonds,
and
16


awarding
contracts
(Code
sections
468.34
through
468.37).
17


These
provisions
apply
if
the
amount
of
the
work
exceeds
a
18


certain
threshold
($20,000).
However,
the
“Iowa
Construction
19


Bidding
Procedures
Act”
(Code
chapter
26)
provides
similar
20


requirements
for
a
“governmental
entity”
defined
in
part
to
21


mean
the
state,
political
subdivisions
of
the
state,
and
all
22


boards
or
commissions
empowered
to
enter
into
contracts
for
23


the
construction
of
public
improvements.
The
threshold
that
24


triggers
those
requirements
is
an
amount
in
excess
of
$100,000.
25


The
bill
requires
the
board
to
follow
the
competitive
bid
26


requirements
of
Code
chapter
26.
27


ANNEXED
LAND
——
ASSESSMENTS.
The
bill
amends
provisions
28


which
allow
a
drainage
or
levee
district
to
annex
territory
for
29


purposes
of
ensuring
that
persons
benefiting
from
a
district
30


also
pay
for
its
maintenance
(Code
section
468.119).
The
bill
31


provides
that
after
the
annexed
lands
have
been
classified
and
32


the
benefits
determined
by
the
board,
the
classifications
shall
33


be
used
as
the
basis
for
future
assessments.
In
addition,
the
34


board
may
impose
a
special
assessment
on
the
annexed
lands
35


-10-


LSB
1111YH

for
the
cost
of
improvements
made
within
the
district
for
not
1


longer
than
five
years
prior
to
the
date
of
annexation.
The
2


amount
of
the
special
assessment
cannot
exceed
the
amount
that
3


would
have
been
assessed
if
the
annexed
lands
were
part
of
the
4


drainage
or
levee
district
during
that
period.
A
board
which
5


uses
this
option
cannot
also
assess
the
land
based
on
current
6


law
which
provides
that
the
board
may
impose
a
levy
on
assessed
7


land
for
a
cost
originally
assumed
by
the
district
but
where
8


not
assessed
upon
the
annexed
land
because
such
land
was
not
9


included
due
to
oversight
(Code
section
468.121).
10


USE
OF
AGREEMENTS.
The
bill
amends
a
provision
that
11


authorizes
the
board
to
enter
into
agreements
with
an
owner
12


of
land
located
outside
the
district,
or
another
district
or
13


city,
in
a
manner
that
benefits
that
outside
party
(e.g.,
14


extending
levee
protection)
subject
to
a
number
of
conditions
15


(the
facilities
of
the
district
cannot
be
overburdened,
16


there
cannot
be
any
additional
cost
to
the
district,
and
the
17


agreement
must
be
part
of
the
district’s
records).
The
bill
18


provides
that
the
district
may
enter
into
an
agreement
with
an
19


owner
of
land
located
within
the
district.
It
also
provides
20


that
the
agreement’s
provisions
may
modify
any
other
applicable
21


provision
in
drainage
law.
