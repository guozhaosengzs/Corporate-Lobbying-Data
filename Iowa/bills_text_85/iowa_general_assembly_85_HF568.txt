enrolled
in
the
Medicaid
program
while
they
were
in
foster
17


care,
are
eligible
for
Medicaid
up
to
26
years
of
age.
As
a
18


conforming
measure,
the
bill
eliminates
Medicaid
eligibility
19


for
an
individual
who
is
under
the
age
of
21
who
aged
out
of
the
20


foster
care
system
and
has
an
income
of
less
than
200
percent
21


of
the
federal
poverty
level.
This
provision
takes
effect
22


December
31,
2013.
23


The
bill
amends
provisions
relating
to
the
hawk-i
program.
24


Because
the
ACA
changes
requirements
relating
to
determination
25


of
eligibility
and
the
application
process,
the
bill
eliminates
26


various
provisions
relating
to
application
development
and
27


the
application
process
under
the
hawk-i
program.
The
bill
28


eliminates
the
requirement
that
DHS
develop
a
joint
application
29


form
for
the
hawk-i
and
Medicaid
programs;
eliminates
the
30


requirement
that
the
hawk-i
board
and
DHS
develop
and
implement
31


a
plan
to
improve
coordination
between
the
hawk-i
program
and
32


the
Medicaid
program;
and
eliminates
the
requirement
that
33


the
hawk-i
board
and
DHS
adopt
rules
addressing
the
hawk-i
34


application
form
and
standards
for
program
eligibility.

Because
of
changes
in
the
application
process,
the
bill
1


provides
that
the
administrative
contractor
shall
determine
2


eligibility
as
prescribed
by
federal
law
and
regulation,
using
3


policies
and
procedures
established
by
rule
rather
than
based
4


on
a
review
of
individual
applications.
The
administrative
5


contractor
must
also
utilize
the
department’s
eligibility
6


system
to
maintain
eligibility
files
with
pertinent
eligibility
7


determination
and
ongoing
enrollment
information.
The
bill
8


also
eliminates
the
following
duties
of
the
administrative
9


contractor:
forward
names
of
children
that
may
be
eligible
10


for
Medicaid
to
DHS
and
retain
their
identifying
data;
monitor
11


and
assess
the
medical
and
dental
care
provided
as
well
as
12


complaints
and
grievances;
verify
and
forward
participating
13


insurers’
payment
requests
to
DHS;
develop
and
issue
approval,
14


denial,
and
cancellation
notifications
to
applicants
and
15


enrollees,
and
process
applications;
and
receive
completed
16


applications
and
verifications
at
a
central
location.
The
bill
17


also
eliminates
the
duty
of
the
administrative
contractor
to
18


conduct
a
review
of
the
circumstances
of
the
child’s
family
19


to
establish
eligibility
and
cost-sharing
in
the
subsequent
20


eligibility
period
following
the
initial
determination
and
21


period
of
eligibility.
22


The
bill
requires
the
use
of
the
modified
adjusted
gross
23


income
methodology
as
required
under
the
ACA
to
establish
24


family
income
in
determining
eligibility
for
hawk-i.
25


The
bill
modifies
the
ability
of
an
enrollee
to
request
a
26


change
in
health
plans
by
providing
that
an
enrollee
of
the
27


program
may
request
to
change
plans
within
the
initial
90-day
28


period
of
enrollment
for
any
reason
and
at
any
time
for
cause,
29


as
identified
in
federal
regulations,
and
otherwise
may
change
30


once
a
year
on
the
enrollee’s
anniversary
date.
31


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
the
hawk-i
board
32


study
and
make
recommendations
regarding
the
level
of
family
33


income
appropriate
for
application
to
the
program;
and
the
34


requirement
that
the
board
and
the
council
on
human
services

cooperate
to
coordinate
the

and

and
develop

plan
for
a
unified

medical

and

program
system
through
use

The

makes
other

changes
to

provisions
under
