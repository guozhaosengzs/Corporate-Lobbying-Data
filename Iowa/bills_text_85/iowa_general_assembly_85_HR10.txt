HOUSE
RESOLUTION
NO.
10


BY
WORTHAN
and
MOORE


A
Resolution
urging
the
members
of
Congress
to
amend
1


federal
law
to
increase
the
maximum
combined
gross
2


weight
allowed
for
motor
vehicles
operated
on
3


interstate
highways
in
Iowa.
4


WHEREAS,
federal
laws
and
regulations
impose
a
5


combined
gross
weight
limit
of
80,000
pounds
for
6


vehicles
operated
on
interstate
highways
in
Iowa;
and
7


WHEREAS,
when
federal
weight
limits
were
established
8


for
interstate
highways,
the
weight
limits
in
effect
9


at
the
time
for
various
states
were
“grandfathered”,
10


so
that
the
weight
limits
established
for
interstate
11


highways
in
many
states
are
higher
than
the
weight
12


limit
in
Iowa;
and
13


WHEREAS,
due
to
the
current
weight
limit
on
Iowa’s
14


interstates,
trucks
with
heavier
loads
are
forced
onto
15


state
and
local
roads,
thereby
increasing
traffic
and
16


adding
to
the
wear
and
tear
on
those
roads;
and
17


WHEREAS,
federal
policies
which
allow
heavier
18


truck
traffic
on
interstate
highways
in
western
states
19


put
Iowa
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
with
those
20


states;
NOW
THEREFORE,
21


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
22


That
the
House
of
Representatives
urges
Congress
23


to
amend
federal
law
to
permit
the
federal
highway
24


administration
to
raise
the
weight
limit
on
interstate
25


highways
in
Iowa
to
96,000
pounds;
and
26


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
copies
of
this
27


resolution
be
transmitted
