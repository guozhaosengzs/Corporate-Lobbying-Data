14,
2016,
which
10


is
the
day
after
the
2014
general
election
day,
to
allow
the
11


new
system
to
commence
with
a
new
campaign
cycle.
New
Code
12


section
68A.804
provides
guidelines
for
disposition
of
money
13


collected
by
candidates
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
14


public
financing
program.
15


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
16


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
17


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
18


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
19


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
20


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
21


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
