EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
state
taxes
by
repealing
the
individual
18


income
tax
and
increasing
the
state
sales
and
use
tax
rates.
19


Division
I
repeals
the
individual
income
tax
and
makes
20


numerous
conforming
changes
to
the
Code
to
remove
references
21


to
the
individual
income
tax
and
to
update
or
move
provisions
22


of
the
individual
income
tax
that
are
also
applicable
by
23


reference
to
the
corporate
income
tax
and
the
franchise
tax.
24


The
division
also
repeals
the
emergency
medical
services
income
25


surtax
in
Code
chapter
422D,
the
instructional
support
income
26


surtax
in
Code
section
257.21,
the

surtax

section
257.29,
