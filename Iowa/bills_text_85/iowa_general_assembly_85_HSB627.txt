granted
the
power
to
hear
and
decide
special
exceptions
to
20


city
zoning
regulations.

bill
provides
that
the

22


otherwise
provided
by
the
city
council

the
board
of
adjustment
to
authorize
24


a
variance
from
zoning
regulations
not

bill
allows
the
granting
of
a
28


variance
if
literal
enforcement
of
the
provisions
of
the
29


ordinance
will
result
in
practical
difficulty,
rather
than

unnecessary
hardship.
