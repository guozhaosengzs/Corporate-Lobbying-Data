1.
The
department
shall
develop
a
nutrient
credit
earning
11


and
trading
initiative,
which
shall
be
designed
to
assist
in
12


the
reduction
of
nutrients
in
surface
waters.
The
nutrient
13


credit
earning
and
trading
initiative
shall
utilize
a
voluntary
14


cost-effective,
market-based
exchange
that
allows
a
point
15


source
discharger
of
nutrients
to
achieve
an
established
16


discharge
limit
by
purchasing
offset
credits
from
other
17


dischargers
who
reduce
their
discharge
by
equal
or
greater
18


amounts.
The
initiative
shall
also
include
the
establishment
19


of
a
pilot
project
to
determine
strategies
for
the
initiative’s
20


permanent
success.
The
nutrient
credit
earning
and
trading
21


initiative
shall
be
consistent
with
findings
included
in
the
22


document
entitled
“Iowa
nutrient
reduction
strategy”
prepared
23


by
the
department
of
agriculture

The
department
shall
investigate
the
feasibility
of
27


establishing
an
interstate
nutrient
credit

program

states
in
the
Mississippi

summarizes
its
efforts

EXPLANATION
10


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
appropriates
$175,000
to
the
department
of
13


agriculture
and
land
stewardship
to
begin
developing
a
14


nutrient
credit
earning
and
trading
initiative,
including
by
15


establishing
a
pilot
project.
The
department
must
investigate
16


the
feasibility
of
establishing
an
interstate
nutrient
credit
17


earning
and
trading
program
among
states
in
the
Mississippi
18


river
basin.
The
department
is
required
to
submit
a
report
to
19


the
general
assembly
by
December
1,
2014,
regarding
its
efforts
20


and
recommendations
to
establish
a
viable
exchange
for
earning
21


and
trading
nutrient
credits
and
necessary
statutory
changes.
22


Generally,
nutrient
credit
trading
is
a
system
that
23


recognizes
two
sources
of
surface
water
pollution
——
a
point
24


source
that
can
be
identified
(e.g.,
a
pipe
that
discharges
25


waste),
and
a
nonpoint
source
that
cannot
be
so
identified
26


(e.g.,
runoff).
The
system
requires
the
establishment
of
27


certain
nutrient
(nitrogen
and
phosphorus)
limits
or
“caps”
28


for
sources
and
allows
the
point
source
to
exceed
its
cap
by
29


purchasing
credits
from
sellers,
including
other
point
sources
30


or
nonpoint
sources,
who
reduce
their
nutrient
contribution.
