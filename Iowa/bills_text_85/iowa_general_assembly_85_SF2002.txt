in
mammogram
reports
sent
to
11


referring
physicians
and
written
statements

Your

that
you

have
dense
breast


22


tissue.
Dense
breast
tissue
is
very
common
and
is
not
23


abnormal.
However,
dense
breast
tissue
can
make
it
more
24


difficult
to
find
cancer
on
a
mammogram.
A
report
of
your


25


mammography
results,
which
contains
information
about
your


26


breast
density,
has
been
sent
to
your
referring
physician’s
27


office,
and
you
should
contact
your
physician
if
you
have
any
28


questions
or
concerns
about
this
report.
29


(2)
Nothing
in
this
paragraph
“b”
shall
be
construed
to
30


create
or
impose
liability
on
a
facility
where
mammography


31


services
are
performed
beyond
the
duty
to
provide
the


32


information
set
forth
in
this
paragraph


“b”
.
33


(3)


Nothing
in
this
paragraph
“b”
shall
be
deemed
to
require
34


a
notice
or
the
provision
of
information
that
is
inconsistent
