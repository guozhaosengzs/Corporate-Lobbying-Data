Federal
determination
governs.
In
determining
whether
31


an
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien,
the
court
shall
consider
32


only
the
federal
government’s
determination
pursuant
to
8
33


U.S.C.
§
1373(c).
The
federal
government’s
determination
34


creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
of

employee’s
lawful

status.
The
court
may
take
judicial
notice
of
the
federal
1


government’s
determination
and
may
request
the
federal
2


government
to
provide
automated
or
testimonial
verification
3


pursuant
to
8
U.S.C.
§
1373(c).

Good-faith
compliance.
For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
5


an
employer
that
establishes
that
it
has
complied
in
good
6


faith
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
1324a(b)
establishes
7


a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the
employer
did
not
8


knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
An
employer
is
9


considered
to
have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
10


1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
11


technical
or
procedural
failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
12


there
is
a
good-faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
13


9.
Entrapment
as
affirmative
defense.
14


a.
It
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
violation
of
subsection
15


1
that
the
employer
was
entrapped.
To
claim
entrapment,
the
16


employer
must
admit
by
the
employer’s
testimony
or
other
17


evidence
the
substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
18


employer
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
19


of
proving
all
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
20


evidence:
21


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
22


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the
23


employer.
24


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
25


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
26


(3)
The
employer
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
violation
27


before
the
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
28


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
29


b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
30


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
31


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
an
32


opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
It
is
not
entrapment
for
33


law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
merely
to
use
a
ruse
34


or
to
conceal
their
identity.

EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
prohibits
employers
and
public
employers
from
6


knowingly
employing
unauthorized
aliens.
The
bill
defines
an
7


“employer”
as
a
person,
as
defined
in
Code
chapter
4,
that
does
8


business
with
or
receives
an
economic
development
incentive
9


from
a
public
employer,
and
that
employs
one
or
more
employees
10


in
the
state.
The
bill
defines
“public
employer”
as
this
state
11


or
a
political
subdivision
of
this
state.
12


The
bill
requires
the
county
attorney
to
bring
an
action
13


in
district
court
against
an
employer
for
a
violation
in
the
14


county
where
the
unauthorized
alien
employee
is
or
was
employed
15


by
the
employer.
The
bill
provides
that
such
an
action
must
be
16


expedited
by
the
court.
17


The
bill
provides
that
for
a
first
violation,
the
court
18


must
order
the
employer
to
terminate
the
employment
of
all
19


of
its
unauthorized
alien
employees
and
to
submit
a
signed
20


sworn
affidavit
to
that
effect
or
face
suspension
of
business
21


licenses
by
appropriate
agencies.
The
court
must
also
order
22


a
three-year
probationary
period
for
the
employer.
The
court
23


may
also
order
the
suspension
of
the
employer’s
business
24


licenses
by
appropriate
agencies
for
up
to
10
business
days,
25


after
considering
certain
factors.
The
bill
provides
that
for
26


a
second
violation,
defined
as
a
violation
occurring
during
a
27


probationary
period
for
a
previous
violation,
the
court
must
28


order
the
revocation
of
the
employer’s
business
licenses.
29


Licenses
revoked
in
this
manner
cannot
be
reissued.
The
bill
30


directs
the
secretary
of
state
to
maintain
an
online
database
31


of
first-time
offenders.
32


The
bill
provides
that
the
district
court
can
only
consider
33


a
determination
by
the
federal
government
in
determining
the
34


immigration
status
of
an
alleged
unauthorized
alien
employee.

The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
who
establishes
that
the
1


employer
complied
in
good
faith
with
8
U.S.C.
§
1324a(b)
2


establishes
a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the
employer
3


did
not
knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
The
bill
4


provides
that
an
employer
is
considered
to
have
complied
with
5


the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
6


isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
technical
or
procedural
7


failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
there
is
a
good-faith
8


attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
The
bill
provides
an
9


employer
with
an
affirmative
defense
of
entrapment
if
certain
10


elements
are
met.
11


The
bill
requires
an
employer
or
public
employer
hiring
a
12


new
employee
to
verify
the
employee’s
employment
eligibility
13


through
the
federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
requires
the
14


employer
or
public
employer
to
keep
records
of
the
verification
15


for
the
duration
of
the
employee’s
employment
or
three
years,
16


whichever
is
longer.
17


The
bill
also
requires
an
employer
receiving
an
economic
18


development
incentive
from
a
public
employer
in
the
state
to
19


register
with
the
federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
provides
20


that
an
employer
who
does
not
comply
with
the
requirement
21


must
repay
all
moneys
received
as
an
economic
development
22


incentive.
The
bill
provides
an
employer
the
right
to
appeal
a
23


determination
of
noncompliance,
and
does
not
require
repayment
24


until
a
final
determination
of
noncompliance
is
made.
25


The
bill
directs
the
secretary
of
state
to
request
from
26


the
United
States
department
of
homeland
security
a
list
of
27


employers
and
public
employers
registered
with
the
e-verify
28


program
every
three
months.
The
bill
directs
the
secretary
of
29


state
to
make
the
list
available
on
the
secretary
of
state’s
30


internet
site.
31


The
bill
provides
that
the
bill
shall
not
be
construed
to
32


require
an
employer
or
public
employer
to
take
any
action
that
33


the
employer
believes
in
good
faith
would
violate
federal
or
34


state
law.

The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
1


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
2


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
3


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
4


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
5


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
6


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
