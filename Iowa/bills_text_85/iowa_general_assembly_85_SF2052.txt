within
thirty
days
after

the
date
upon
which
the

creating

takes

effect,
but
the

and

unless
the

An

be
brought
questioning
the
5


regularity
of
the
proceedings
pertaining
to
the
creation
of
6


a
district
or
the

of
the

takes
effect.
12

The
procedural
steps
for
the

332.6,
or
15


the
procedural
steps

The
rate
of
debt
service
tax
referred

petition
and
the
ordinance
creating
the

shall
only
19


restrict
the
amount
of
bonds
which

be
issued,
and

20


not
limit
the

of
the

to
levy
as
necessary
in
21


subsequent
years
to
pay
interest
and
amortize
the
principal
22


of
that
amount
of
bonds.
Bonds
issued

23


332.10

constitute
indebtedness
within
the
meaning
of
any
24


constitutional
or
statutory
debt
limitations
or
restrictions.
25


13.
The
ordinance
creating
the
district
may
provide
for
26


the
division
of
all
of
the
property
within
the
district
into
27


two
or
more
zones
based
upon
a
reasonable
difference
in
the
28


relationship
of
the
property
or
the
interest
of
its
owners,
29


whether
the
difference
is
qualitative
or
quantitative.
The
30


ordinance
creating
the
district
and
establishing
the
zones
31


may
establish
a
different
maximum
rate
of
tax
for
each
zone,
32


or
may
provide
that
the
zone
shall
be
credited
with
a
certain
33


set
percentage
of
the
improvement
district
taxes
levied
in
the

The

may
be

from
any
of
the
11


following
funding
sources
or
a
combination
thereof:
12


1.
The

The

of
the
county
that
are
legally
available
16


to
pay
all
or

of
the
costs
of
an

The
17


fact
that
an

chapter
18


shall
not
preclude
the
county
from
paying
the
costs
of
the
19


improvement
from
any
fund
from
which
it
might
otherwise
20


have
been
able

In

of
the
foregoing,
an

that

22


an
essential
county
purpose
or
a
general
county
purpose,
as
23


defined
in
section
331.441,
may

made.
If

anticipatory

may

issued
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
31


not
exceeding
that
permitted
by

This
bill
authorizes
the
creation
of
county
improvement
17


districts.
18


A
county
improvement
district
shall
be
comprised
of
19


contiguous
property
wholly
within
the
unincorporated
area
of
20


the
county,
be
comprised
only
of
property
which
is
zoned
for
21


commercial
or
industrial
use,
and
be
comprised
of
property
22


related
in
some
manner,
including
but
not
limited
to
present
23


or
potential
use,

relationship
24


to
an
area,

or
potential
commercial
25


or

activity
in
an
area,
so
as
to
be
benefited
in
any
26


manner.
27


The
county
board
of
supervisors
shall
initiate
proceedings
28


for
creating
a
district
upon
the
filing
with
the
county
auditor
29


of
a
petition
containing
the
signatures
of
at
least
50
percent
30


of
all
owners
of
property
within
the
proposed
district
if
those
31


owners
represent
ownership
of
property
with
an
assessed
value
32


of
50
percent
or
more
of
the
assessed
value
of
all
of
the
33


property
in
the
proposed
district.
The
petition
shall
also
34


state

within
the
district
for
purposes
of
the
district,
state
the
1


purpose
of
the
district,
and
state
whether
the
district
is
2


authorized
to
use
utility
replacement
tax
revenue.
3


The
board
is
required
to
notify
and
receive
recommendations
4


from
the
county
zoning
commission
or
other
applicable
entities,
5


if
existing,
regarding
the
creation
of
the
district.
Upon
the
6


receipt
of
the
county
zoning
commission’s
final
report,
if
7


applicable,
or
the
completion
of
a
public
hearing
if
no
such
8


commission
exists,
the
board
shall
set
a
time
and
place
for
a
9


public
hearing
on
creation
of
the
district.
Adoption
of
the
10


ordinance
creating
a
district
requires
the
affirmative
vote
of
11


three-fourths
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
board.
However,
if
12


a
remonstrance
has
been
filed
with
the
county
auditor
signed
13


by
at
least
50
percent
of
all
owners
of
property
within
the
14


proposed
district
representing
ownership
of
property
with
an
15


assessed
value
of
50
percent
or
more
of
the
assessed
value
of
16


all
of
the
property
in
the
proposed
district,
the
adoption
of
17


the
ordinance
requires
a
unanimous
vote
of
the
board.
18


The
bill
establishes
procedures
for
objecting
to
the
19


creation
of
the
district,
for
appealing
the
actions
of
20


the
board
relating
to
the
district,
for
dissolution
of
the
21


district,
and
for

the
ordinance

22


The
bill
establishes
the
procedure
and
requirements
for
a
23


county
when
the
county
proposes
to
construct
an
improvement,
24


as
defined
in
the
bill.
The
procedure
for
approving
the
25


construction
of
an
improvement
financed
with
tax
revenue
26


authorized
in
the
bill
is
similar
to
the
approval
process
for
27


the
creation
of
the
district.
The
bill
defines
“improvement”
28


to
mean
works,
structures,
and
facilities
located
within
or
29


outside
the
district
that
are
necessary
to
provide
utility
30


services
to
property
within
the
district,
including
but
not
31


limited
to
water,
electric,
gas,
telecommunications,
and
sewer
32


utilities.
33


The
bill
authorizes
the
county
to
utilize
three
sources
34


of
tax
revenue
to
undertake
construction
and
financing
of
an

First,
the
county
may
elect
to
receive
each
year,
1


for
a
period
not
to

20
years
following
initial
creation
2


of
the
district,
a
specified
amount
of
utility
replacement
3


taxes
collected
under
Code
chapter
437A.
The
utility
4


replacement
tax
revenue
is
required
to
be
deposited
in
either
5


the
district’s
capital
improvement
fund
or
the
district’s
6


debt
service
fund.
Second,
the
county
may
impose
a
capital
7


improvement
tax
levy
for
the
purpose
of
accumulating
moneys
8


for
the
financing
or
payment
of
a
part
or
all
of
the
costs
of
9


any
improvement.
Third,
the
county
may
impose
a
debt
service
10


levy
in
the
amount
necessary
to
pay
interest
as
it
becomes
due
11


and
the
amount
necessary
to
pay,
or
to
create
a
sinking
fund
12


to
pay,
the
principal
at
maturity
of
all
county
improvement
13


district
bonds
issued
by
the
county.
14


The
bill
authorizes
the
county
to
issue
county
improvement
15


district
bonds
at
public
or
private
sale
payable
from
the
levy
16


of
unlimited
ad
valorem
taxes
on
all
the
taxable
property
17


within
the
district
through
the
improvement
district
debt
18


service
fund
and
from
replacement
tax
revenue
received
and
19


deposited
in
the
improvement
district
debt
service
fund.
20


The
costs
of
improvements
undertaken
by
the
county
in
a
21


district
may
be
paid
from
any
of
the
following
sources
or
a
22


combination
thereof:
(1)
the
district’s
capital
improvement
23


fund;
(2)
the
proceeds
of
county
improvement
district
24


bonds;
(3)
any
other
funds
of
the
county
which
are
otherwise
25


legally
available
to
pay
all
or
a
portion
of
the
costs
of
an
26


improvement.
27


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
