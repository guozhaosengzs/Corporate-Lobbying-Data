EXPLANATION
11


This
bill
amends
Code
section
321.384
to
require
the
12


operator
of
a
motor
vehicle
to
display
lighted
headlamps
from
13


sunset
to
sunrise;
whenever
atmospheric
conditions
require
14


the
use
of
windshield
wipers;
during
any
period
of
rain,
15


drizzle,
sleet,
hail,
snow,
blowing
snow,
freezing
rain,
or
16


ground-level
fog;
or
whenever,
due
to
insufficient
lighting
or
17


unfavorable
atmospheric
conditions,
persons
and
vehicles
on
18


the
highway
are
not
clearly
discernible
at
a
distance
of
1,000
19


feet.
Currently,
the
use
of
headlamps
is
required
from
sunset
20


to
sunrise
and
at
all
other
times
when
conditions
such
as
fog,
21


snow,
sleet,
or
rain
provide
insufficient
lighting
to
clearly
22


see
500
feet
ahead.
23


The
penalty
that
currently
applies
to
a
violation
of
24


requirements
for
headlight
use
applies
to
the
new
requirements
25


under
the
bill.
A
violation
is
a
simple
misdemeanor,
26


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$30.
The
bill
adds
a
27


violation
of
Code
section
321.384
to
the
list
of
traffic
28


offenses
for
which
additional
penalties
may
be
imposed
for
a
29


violation
causing
serious
injury
to
or
death
of
another
person.
30


If
the
violation
causes
a
serious
personal
injury,
a
court
31


could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
32


driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
33


violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
34


fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
