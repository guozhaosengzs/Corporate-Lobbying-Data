25


This

poison
control
center
support
29


fund
in
the
state
treasury
under
the
authority
of
the
30


department

Health

4


and
payments
of
subscriber
contracts
and
paid
losses
in
this
5


state
in
excess
of
$100,000
per
year
are
required
to
pay
annual
6


assessments
for
deposit
into
the
fund
as
determined
by
the
7


commissioner
of
insurance
so
that
total
deposits
into
the
fund
8


from
such
assessments
equal
$500,000
each
year.
Beginning
9


in
2015,
the
amount
of
the
total
assessments
due
for
deposit
10


into
the

12


The
commissioner
of

is
directed
to
determine
13


the

in
the
state
in
14


proportion
to
each
health
carrier’s
respective
share
as
set
15


forth
in
the
bill.
The
commissioner
may
abate
or
defer
any
16


assessment,
if,
in
the
commissioner’s
opinion,
payment
of
the
17


assessment
would
endanger
the
ability
of
the
health
carrier
18


to
fulfill
its
contractual
obligations.
For
purposes
of
19


calculating
and
conducting
the
assessment,
the
commissioner
has
20


the
authority
to
require
health
carriers
to
report
on
an
annual
21


basis
each
health
carrier’s
total
health
insurance
premiums
and
22


payments
for
subscriber
contracts
and
paid
losses.

The
commissioner

health
carriers

and
each
May

of
the
