EXPLANATION
8


This
bill
modifies
provisions
applicable
to
the
9


administration
and
funding
of
enhanced
E911
emergency
10


communication
systems.
11


The
bill
eliminates
existing
voter
referendum
requirements
12


regarding
imposition
of
the
local
wire-line
E911
service
13


surcharge
and
the
alternative
surcharge
applicable
to
wire-line
14


communications
contained
in
Code
sections
34A.6
and
34A.6A,
15


respectively.
The
bill
replaces
current
provisions
authorizing
16


imposition
of
the
wire-line
E911
service
surcharge
in
an
amount
17


up
to
$1
per
access
line
with
a
requirement
that
the
surcharge
18


be
imposed
at
the
$1
level.
The
bill
increases
the
level
of
19


the
emergency
communications
service
surcharge
from
the
current
20


level
of
up
to
65
cents
per
communications
service
number
to
21


$1
per
service
number.
22


The
bill
reinstates
provisions
authorizing
wireless
carriers
23


to
recover
their
E911
service
delivery
costs
which
were
24


eliminated
during
the
2012
legislative
session.
However,
the
25


bill
specifies
that
the
program
manager
shall
allocate
13
26


percent
of
the
total
amount
of
emergency
communications
service
27


surcharge
revenue
for
such
cost
recovery.
Further,
the
bill
28


requires
the
E911
program
manager
to
consult
with
the
E911
29


communications
council
regarding
how
revenue
accumulated
in
the
30


emergency
communications
fund
as
carryover
operating
surplus
31


shall
be
allocated.
Currently,
this
determination
is
made
32


strictly
with
the
approval
of
the
program
manager.
33


Additionally,
the
bill
directs
the
program
manager,
in
34


consultation
with
the
council,
to
establish
a
methodology
