rate


for
purposes
of
the
one
five-year
lease
renewal
by
June
30,


2018,
if
the
Iowa

requests
arbitration


concerning

the

be
determined
by
binding
arbitration


in

A
request
for

to
the
other
party.

After

all
offers
until
an

is


rendered
by
the
arbitrators.
For
purposes
of
determining
the


fair

rental
rate
for
purposes
of

one
five-year


lease
renewal,
either
party
may
argue,
and
present
arguments


and
evidence,
that
the
renewal
lease
rental
rate
should
be


based
upon
the
market
value
of
similarly
situated
undeveloped


land,
or
upon
its
use
as
a
greyhound
track.
The
submission


of
the
disputed
items

be
limited
to


those
items
upon
which
the
parties
have
not
reached
agreement.


However,
the
arbitrators
shall
have
no
authority
to
extend
the


term
of

lease
agreement

the
initial
five-year
term

arbitrators
shall
render
a
decision
within


fifteen
days

give


written
explanation
for
the
decision
and
the
decision
of
the


arbitrators
shall
be
final
and
binding
on
the
parties,
and
any


decision
of
the
arbitrators
may
be
entered
in
any
court
having


competent
jurisdiction.
The
decision
by
the
arbitrators
and


the
items
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
shall
be
deemed
to
be


the
lease
agreement
between
the
parties
and
such
final
lease


agreement
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
governing


body
of
the
city
of
Dubuque,
the
Iowa
greyhound
association,


the
commission,
or
any
other
government
body.
Each
party
to


the
arbitration
shall
bear
its
own
expenses,
including
attorney


fees,
and
the
parties
shall
share
equally
the
filing
and
other


administrative
fees
of
the
American
arbitration
association
and


the
expenses
of
the
