EXPLANATION
12


This
bill
requires
food
items
to
be
labeled
with
information
13


that
identifies
the
food
items
as
genetically
engineered.
The
14


department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
is
responsible
15


for
administering
and
enforcing
the
bill’s
provisions.
A
16


person
manufacturing
a
packaged
food
item
for
sale
to
a
grocery
17


store
must
disclose
whether
it
was
or
may
have
been
subjected
18


to
genetic
engineering
when
produced.
The
disclosure
must
19


appear
on
a
printed
label.
The
label
on
a
package
must
be
based
20


on
federal
ingredient
labeling
standards.
The
bill
creates
an
21


exception
for
a
small
business
which
has
either
fewer
than
20
22


employees
or
an
annual
gross
income
of
less
than
$4
million.
23


Certain
food
items
are
exempted,
including
meat,
fish,
24


or
poultry
that
was
fed
with
genetically
engineered
feed
25


and
alcoholic
beverages.
Certain
food
items
are
presumed
26


not
to
have
been
genetically
engineered
including
foods
27


labeled
organic
or
certified
by
a
third
party.
A
person
28


manufacturing
a
packaged
food
item
who
fails
to
comply
with
29


the
labeling
standards,
is
subject
to
civil
penalties.
The
30


civil
penalty
equals
$100
per
food
item
that
is
not
labeled
in
31


compliance
with
the
bill’s
provisions.
However,
under
certain
32


circumstances
a
manufacturer’s
civil
penalty
is
capped
at
33


$10,000
for
the
sale
or
offer
for
sale
of
a
single
manufactured
34


lot
of
packaged
food
items.
