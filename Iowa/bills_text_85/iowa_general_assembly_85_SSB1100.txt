This
bill
relates
to
property
taxes
of
certain
disabled
1


veterans.
2


The
disabled
veterans
tax
credit
under
Code
section
425.15
3


provides
a
credit
on
the
homestead
of
an
eligible
veteran
4


who
acquired
the
homestead
under
specified
federal
programs
5


in
an
amount
equal
to
the
entire
amount
of
the
tax
levied
on
6


the
homestead.
This
bill
modifies
the
qualifications
for
the
7


disabled
veterans
tax
credit
by
adding
to
the
list
of
veterans
8


who
are
eligible
for
the
credit,
a
veteran
as
defined
in
Code
9


section
35.1
with
a
permanent
and
total
service-connected
10


disability
as
certified
by
the
United
States
department
of
11


veterans
affairs.
The
bill
also
strikes
the
income
limitation
12


qualifications
for
the
disabled
veteran
tax
credit.
13


The
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
425.15A,
which
provides
14


that
the
property
tax
on
a
disabled
veteran’s
homestead
shall
15


not
increase
from
year
to
year.
To
receive
this
credit,
the
16


veteran
must
file
on
or
before
June
30
in
a
manner
similar
17


to
filing
for
the
regular
homestead
credit.
Once
the
claim
18


is
filed
and
allowed,
the
veteran
does
not
have
to
file
for
19


successive
years
so
long
as
the
property
is
still
owned
and
20


used
by
the
veteran
as
a
homestead.
21


The
bill
defines
“disabled
veteran”
for
the
purposes
of
new
22


Code
section
425.15A
to
be
a
veteran
as
defined
in
Code
section
23


35.1,
who
has
a
service-connected
disability
rating
of
at
least
24


50
percent
as
certified
by
the
United
States
department
of
25


veterans
affairs.
26


Code
section
25B.7
provides
that
for
a
property
tax
credit
27


or
exemption
enacted
on
or
after
January
1,
1997,
if
a
state
28


appropriation
made
to
fund
the
credit
or
exemption
is
not
29


sufficient
to
fully
fund
the
credit
or
exemption,
the
political
30


subdivision
shall
be
required
to
extend
to
the
taxpayer
only
31


that
portion
of
the
credit
or
exemption
estimated
by
the
32


department
of
revenue
to
be
funded
by
the
state
appropriation.
33


The
bill
provides
that
Code
section
25B.7
does
not
apply
to
34


the
credits
in
the
bill.
