EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
relates
to
child
abuse
reporting,
assessment
8


procedures,
and
placement
on
and
removal
from
the
central
9


registry
for
child
abuse
information.
10


MULTIPATH
ASSESSMENT
PROCESS.
Current
law
provides
that,
11


upon
receipt
of
a
child
abuse
report,
the
department
of
human
12


services
(DHS)
immediately
determines
whether
the
report
13


constitutes
an
allegation
of
child
abuse
which
will
lead
to
the
14


commencement
of
an
assessment.
The
bill
removes
language
that
15


requires
DHS
to
notify
the
appropriate
county
attorney
of
the
16


receipt
of
the
report.
17


The
bill
establishes
a
new
assessment
process
upon
the
18


receipt
of
a
child
abuse
report.
The
bill
provides
that
an
19


assessment
will
be
conducted
as
a
child
abuse
assessment
if
20


the
child
abuse
report
alleges
imminent
danger
or
impacts
21


the
child’s
safety.
A
child
abuse
assessment
results
in
a
22


disposition.
DHS
makes
a
determination
of
whether
the
alleged
23


child
abuse
meets
the
definition
of
child
abuse
and
makes
24


a
determination
of
whether
the
case
meets
the
criteria
for
25


placement
on
the
central
registry
for
child
abuse
information.
26


This
type
of
assessment
is
the
current
procedure
upon
receipt
27


of
a
child
abuse
report.
28


The
bill
adds
a
family
assessment
response
as
another
type
of
29


assessment
process,
which
is
to
be
conducted
if
the
child
abuse
30


report
does
not
allege
imminent
danger
and
does
not
impact
a
31


child’s
safety.
DHS
will
not
make
a
determination
of
whether
32


the
alleged
child
abuse
meets
the
definition
of
child
abuse
33


pursuant
to
a
family
assessment
response.
DHS
also
will
not
34


make
a
determination
of
whether
the
case
meets
the
criteria
for
35

H.F.

placement
on
the
central
registry
for
child
abuse
information
1


under
this
assessment
process.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
2


if,
during
a
family
assessment
response,
it
is
determined
a
3


child
is
unsafe,
it
appears
the
immediate
safety
or
well-being
4


of
a
child
is
endangered,
the
family
may
flee,
the
child
may
5


disappear,
or
if
other
facts
so
warrant,
DHS
shall
immediately
6


commence
a
child
abuse
assessment.
7


Upon
receipt
of
a
child
abuse
report
and
acceptance
that
8


the
child
abuse
report
alleges
an
incident
of
child
abuse,
the
9


bill
requires
DHS
to
commence
either
a
child
abuse
assessment
10


within
24
hours
of
receiving
that
report
or
a
family
assessment
11


response
within
72
hours
of
receiving
that
report.
12


The
bill
provides
that
DHS
is
only
required
to
apply
the
13


current
protocols,
which
are
developed
with
the
local
child
14


protection
assistance
team,
to
prioritize
actions
and
to
work
15


with
child
protection
assistance
teams
and
law
enforcement
16


agencies
in
response
to
a
child
abuse
assessment,
not
a
family
17


assessment
response.
However,
the
bill
does
require
DHS
to
18


immediately
refer
the
matter
to
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
19


agency
if
a
child
abuse
report
is
assessed
under
the
family
20


assessment
response
and
a
criminal
act
harming
a
child
is
21


alleged.
22


The
bill
provides
that
a
child
abuse
assessment
shall
be
23


conducted
as
provided
under
current
law.
The
bill
establishes
24


the
process
for
the
family
assessment
response.
Both
a
child
25


abuse
assessment
and
a
family
assessment
response
include
a
26


safety
assessment,
a
risk
assessment,
and
an
evaluation
of
the
27


home
environment.
28


A
child
abuse
assessment
also
requires,
pursuant
to
current
29


law,
the
identification
of
the
nature,
extent,
and
cause
of
30


injuries
to
the
child
named
in
the
report,
the
identification
31


of
the
person
or
persons
responsible
for
the
alleged
child
32


abuse,
a
description
of
the
name,
age,
and
condition
of
other
33


children
in
the
same
home
as
the
child
named
in
the
report,
34


and
an
interview
of
the
person
alleged
to
have
committed
the
35

child
abuse.
Both
the
child
abuse
assessment
and
the
family
1


assessment
response
may
include
a
home
visit,
facility
or
2


school
visit,
information
request,
protective
disclosure,
and
3


physical
examination
pursuant
to
Code
section
232.71B.
4


The
bill
requires
DHS
to
make
a
written
assessment
statement
5


for
both
a
child
abuse
assessment
and
the
family
assessment
6


response.
The
statements
must
include
information
related
to
7


the
safety
assessment
and
risk
assessment,
information
related
8


to
an
evaluation
of
the
home
environment,
identification
of
the
9


strengths
and
needs
of
the
child,
the
child’s
parent,
home,
and
10


family,
and
an
identification
of
services
available
from
DHS
11


and
other
services
available
in
the
community.
Upon
completion
12


of
the
written
assessment
statement
for
either
the
child
abuse
13


assessment
or
a
family
assessment
response,
DHS
must
consult
14


with
the
child’s
family
to
offer
services
to
the
child
and
the
15


child’s
family.
The
bill
retains
current
requirements
for
16


written
child
abuse
assessment
statements.
17


A
written
child
abuse
assessment
statement
must
be
completed
18


within
20
business
days
of
the
receipt
of
the
child
abuse
19


report
and
a
written
family
assessment
response
statement
must
20


be
completed
within
10
business
days
of
the
receipt
of
the
21


report.
22


The
bill
provides
that
after
a
family
assessment
response,
23


DHS
must
provide
notice
to
the
parent
or
guardian
of
a
child
24


listed
in
the
child
abuse
report
of
the
completion
of
the
25


assessment
and
review
any
service
recommendations.
Notice
to
a
26


person
named
in
the
initial
child
abuse
report
as
responsible
27


for
the
alleged
child
abuse
is
not
required,
as
that
person
28


does
not
have
the
opportunity
for
a
contested
case
hearing
29


since
DHS
did
not
make
a
determination
of
whether
child
abuse
30


occurred
and
the
information
arising
from
a
family
assessment
31


response
is
not
reported
to
the
registry.
32


The
bill
provides
that
DHS
must
provide
the
juvenile
court
33


and
the
county
attorney
with
the
portion
of
a
written
child
34


abuse
assessment
statement
pertaining
to
the
child
abuse

However,
DHS
only
needs
to
provide
such
portion
of
1


the
written
family
assessment
response
statement
in
cases
in
2


which
DHS
is
requesting
a
child
in
need
of
assistance
petition.
3


DHS
may
request
court
action
following
either
a
child
abuse
4


assessment
or
family
assessment
response.
5


The
bill
states
that
the
requirements
of
section
232.71D,
6


relating
to
the
central
registry,
apply
to
child
abuse
7


information
relating
to
a
report
of
child
abuse
and
a
child
8


abuse
assessment,
but
not
to
a
family
assessment
response.
9


The
bill
provides
that
the
confidentiality
of
information
10


relating
to
an
assessment
in
which
no
determination
was
made
11


as
to
whether
the
definition
of
child
abuse
was
met
shall
be
12


maintained
in
accordance
with
Code
section
217.30.
13


The
bill
requires
DHS
to
adopt
rules
regarding
the
intake
14


process,
assessment
process,
assessment
summaries,
contact
15


with
juvenile
court
or
the
county
attorney,
involvement
with
16


law
enforcement,
case
record
retention,
and
dissemination
of
17


records
for
both
child
abuse
assessments
and
family
assessment
18


responses.
19


The
bill
provides
that
the
provisions
relating
to
the
20


establishment
of
a
multipath
assessment
process
upon
the
21


receipt
of
a
child
abuse
report
are
effective
January
1,
2014.
22


CENTRAL
CHILD
ABUSE
REGISTRY.
Current
law
provides
that
23


the
names
of
the
child
and
the
alleged
perpetrator
of
the
24


alleged
child
abuse
and
any
other
child
abuse
information
shall
25


be
placed
in
the
central
registry
as
a
case
of
founded
child
26


abuse
if
DHS
determines
the
acts
or
omissions
of
the
alleged
27


perpetrator
meet
the
definition
of
child
abuse
and
DHS
has
28


determined
within
the
preceding
18
months
that
the
acts
or
29


omissions
of
the
alleged
perpetrator
in
a
prior
case
met
the
30


definition
of
child
abuse.
The
bill
increases
the
amount
of
31


time
between
the
current
offense
and
the
previous
offense,
from
32


18
months
to
five
years,
for
which
a
previous
determination
33


of
child
abuse
will
result
in
placement
on
the
registry.
34


This
section
of
the
bill
is
applicable
to
cases
in
which
the
35


-17-


LSB

previous
case
that

the
definition
of
child
abuse
occurred
1


on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
2


The
bill
also
provides
for
the
removal
of
the
name
of
a
3


person
named
in
the
central
registry
for
child
abuse
as
having
4


abused
a
child
after
five
years
rather
than
the
10
years
5


currently
required
if
in
the
report
and
disposition
data,
DHS
6


determined
the
person
committed
one
of
the
following
types
7


of
child
abuse
as
defined
in
Code
section
232.68:
physical
8


injury,
failure
to
provide
critical
care,
the
presence
of
an
9


illegal
drug
in
the
child’s
body,
and
the
manufacture
and
10


possession
of
a
dangerous
substance
in
the
child’s
presence.
11


However,
the
name
of
such
a
person
named
in
the
initial
data
12


placed
on
the
registry
as
having
abused
a
child
shall
not
be
13


removed
after
five
years
if
the
child
abuse
resulted
in
a
14


child’s
death
or
serious
injury
of
the
child
as
defined
in
15


Code
section
702.18.
The
bill
provides
that
the
Code
section
16


regarding
removal
of
the
name
of
a
person
from
the
registry
17


after
five
years
applies
to
report
and
disposition
data
placed
18


on
the
registry
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
19


The
bill
requires
DHS,
in
conjunction
with
the
department
of
20


inspections
and
appeals,
the
office
of
the
attorney
general,
21


and
other
stakeholders
deemed
appropriate
by
DHS,
to
review
and
22


make
recommendations
regarding
the
process
for
the
removal
of
23


a
person
from
the
child
abuse
registry
prior
to
the
five-year
24


period
as
allowed
under
the
bill,
or
the
10-year
period
25


currently
provided.
The
bill
states
that
the
review
shall
26


include
specific
criteria
that
DHS
must
and
could
consider
27


in
determining
whether
to
remove
a
person
from
the
registry,
28


the
application
process
or
other
action
which
would
commence
29


DHS’s
determination
of
whether
to
remove
the
person
from
the
30


registry,
the
appeal
process
necessary
to
ensure
protection
31


of
a
person’s
due
process
rights,
and
cost
projections
for
32


recommendations.
The
bill
requires
DHS
to
submit
the
report
of
33


the
review
and
recommendations
to
the
governor
and
the
general
34


assembly
by
December
1,
2013.
