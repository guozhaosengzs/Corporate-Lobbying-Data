25


This
bill
relates
to
the
civil
commitment
of
sexually
26


violent
predators.
27

violent
offense

adjudicated
delinquent,
but
whose
juvenile
court
records
have
1


been
sealed
under
Code
section
232.150,
and
a
person
who
has
2


received
a
deferred
sentence
or
a
deferred
judgment
or
has
been
3


acquitted
by
reason
of
insanity.
“Conviction”
includes
the
4


conviction
of
a
juvenile
prosecuted
as
an
adult.
“Convicted”
5


also
includes
a
conviction
for
an
attempt
or
conspiracy
to
6


commit
an
offense.
“Convicted”
does
not
mean
a
plea,
sentence,
7


adjudication,
deferred
sentence,
or
deferred
judgment
which

8


been

9


A
person
civilly
committed
as
a
sexually
violent
predator
10


is
entitled
to
an
annual
review
of
the
person’s
progress
in
11


the
sexually
violent
predator
program.
The
bill
raises
the
12


standard
of
proof
at
the
annual
hearing
from
a
preponderance
13


of
the
evidence
standard
to
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
14


standard.
The
“clear
and
convincing
evidence”
standard
is
a
15


higher
level
of
burden
of
persuasion
than
the
“preponderance
of
16


the
evidence”
standard.
17


Under
the
bill,
the
committed
person
is
required
to
rebut
18


the
presumption
of
continued
commitment
at
the
annual
review
19


by
providing
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
person’s
20


mental
abnormality
has
so
changed
that
the
person
is
not
21


likely
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
or
that
the
person
is
22


suitable
for
placement
in
the
transitional
release
program.
If
23


the
committed
person
successfully
rebuts
the
presumption
of
24


continued
commitment
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
under
25


the
bill,
the
court
is
required
to
order
a
final
hearing
to
26


determine
the
future
placement
status
of
the
person.
27


The
final
hearing
to
determine
the
future
placement
status
28


of
a
committed
person
is
governed
by
Code
section
229A.8(6).
29


The
bill
extends
the
time
period
the
department
of
human
30


services
has
to
prepare
a
release
plan
for
a
person
committed
31


as
a
sexually
violent
predator
who
is
ordered
released
by
32


the
court
from
30
days
to
60
days.
Code
section
229A.9A(3)
33


prohibits
a
committed
person
from
being
released
prior
to
