EXPLANATION
11


This
bill
relates
to
the
administration
of
duties
and
12


programs
of
the
economic
development
authority.
13


Division
I
of
the
bill
makes
an
exception
to
the
two-year
14


limitation
on
the
length
of
a
contract
entered
into
by
the
15


authority
for
the
operation
of
a
federal
EB-5
immigrant
16


investor
regional
center.
17


Currently,
a
business
is
generally
ineligible
to
receive
18


economic
development
assistance
under
the
high
quality
jobs
19


program
if
the
business
has
a
record
that
tends
to
show
20


a
consistent
pattern
of
violations
of
the
law,
including
21


environmental
and
worker
safety
laws
as
well
as
violations
22


of
related
rules
and
regulations.
The
division
adds
that
23


a
business
is
also
ineligible
for
economic
development
24


assistance
if
the
business
engages
in
a
pattern
of
antitrust
25


violations
or
if
a
business’s
conduct
in
violating
any
laws,
26


including
environmental,
worker
safety,
and
antitrust
laws
is
27


intentional,
criminal,
or
reckless.
28


Current
law
requires
that
an
agreement
under
the
high
29


quality
jobs
program
for
assistance
or
incentives
entered
into
30


between
the
authority
and
a
business
include
requirements
for
a
31


business’s
eligibility
for
the
incentives
or
assistance.
The
32


bill
adds
that
the
agreement
must
also
include
the
requirements
33


that
a
business
receiving
incentives
or
assistance
must
34


maintain
throughout
the
period
of
the
agreement.
The
authority
35

S.F.
297


must
ensure
that
a
business
only
receives
the
incentives
or
1


assistance
if
the
business
meets
the
initial
eligibility
2


requirements
and
maintains
the
program
requirements
throughout
3


the
agreement
period.
4


Current
law
also
provides
that
an
agreement
under
the
high
5


quality
jobs
program
must
include
the
repayment
of
incentives
6


or
assistance
by
a
business
if
a
business
does
not
meet
7


the
requirements
in
statute
or
the
agreement.
The
division
8


provides
that
the
repayment
of
incentives,
in
this
context,
is
9


a
tax
payment
due
and
payable
to
the
department
of
revenue
by
10


a
taxpayer,
and
the
taxpayer’s
failure
to
make
the
repayment
11


may
be
treated
by
the
department
of
revenue
in
the
same
manner
12


as
a
failure
to
pay
the
tax
shown
or
required
to
be
shown
13


due
when
filing
a
return
or
deposit
form.
The
division
also
14


authorizes
the
county
to
recover
property
taxes
exempted
under
15


the
agreement.
16


Division
II
of
the
bill
eliminates
the
community
17


microenterprise
development
organization
grant
program.
18


Division
III
of
the
bill
eliminates
the
broadband
access
19


governing
board
created
in
2009
Iowa
Acts.
The

20


board
was
tasked
with
establishing
a
comprehensive
plan
for
21


the
deployment
and
sustainability
of
high-speed
broadband
22


access
in
areas
capable
of
timely
implementation
of
the
23


access,
establishing
a
competitive
process
for
the
disbursement
24


of
funds
for
such
deployment
and
sustainability,
making
25


recommendations
to
the
general
assembly,
and
establishing
and
26


maintaining
separate
accounts
for
the
use
of
certain
proceeds.
27


Division
IV
of
the
bill
relates
to
the
economic
development
28


authority’s
approval
of
industrial
property
tax
exemptions.
29


The
division
eliminates
the
requirement
that
the

30


development
authority
recommend

approval
of
industrial
31


property
tax
exemptions
by
local
governments.
