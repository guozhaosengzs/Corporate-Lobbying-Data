An
19


insurer

waiver
from
20


these

$300
million

based
upon
unique
22

the
24

25


affiliates
to
ascertain
the
financial
condition
of
the

26


including
the
enterprise
risk
to
the
insurer
by
any
entity
or
27


combination
of
entities
within
the
insurance
holding
company
28


system.

with
the
33


Code
chapter.

the

to
engage
in
conducting

supervision
activities.
The
commissioner

25


this
provision
the
reasonable
expenses
of
the
