EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
concerns
county
supervisor
districting
plans.
6


Under
current
law,
following
adoption
by
the
county
7


supervisors
of
a
county
supervisor
districting
plan,
an
8


eligible
elector
from
the
county
may
file,
within
14
days
of
9


adopting
the
plan,
a
complaint
with
the
state
commissioner
of
10


elections
(the
secretary
of
state),
alleging
that
the
plan
was
11


drawn
for
improper
political
reasons.
Once
filed,
current
law
12


provides
that
the
complaint
be
forwarded
to
the
ethics
and
13


campaign
disclosure
board
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
14


plan
was
improperly
drawn.
15


The
bill
eliminates
the
complaint
process
relative
to
the
16


ethics
and
campaign
disclosure
board
and
the
authority
for
the
17


state
commissioner
to
reject
a
plan
for
improper
political
18


reasons.
Instead,
the
bill
provides
that
if
following
the
19


adoption
of
a
county
supervisor
district
plan
a
valid
petition
20


alleging
that
the
plan
was
drawn
for
improper
political
reasons
21


is
filed
with
the
state
commissioner
of
elections,
the
state
22


commissioner
shall
reject
the
plan
and
request
the
legislative
23


council
to
direct
the
legislative
services
agency
to
draw
a
24


plan.
The
bill
provides
that
the
petition
shall
be
filed
25


within
30
days
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
shall
be
26


signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
county
equal
in
number
to
27


at
least
2
percent
of
the
total
votes
cast
for
the
office
of
28


governor
in
the
county
at
the
last
preceding
general
election
29


for
governor.
To
be
counted,
a
signature
shall
not
be
dated
30


prior
to
the
date
the
board
of
supervisors
approved
the
plan.
31


The
bill
provides
that
once
the
state
commissioner
32


determines
that
a
valid
petition
has
been
filed
and
has
made
a
33


request
to
the
legislative
council,
the
legislative
services
34


agency
shall

and
submit
the
plan
to
the
county
board
of
supervisors
1


who
shall
approve
or
reject
the
plan
within
thirty
days.
If
2


the
plan
is
rejected,
the
bill
provides
that
the
county
shall
3


provide
reasons
for
the
rejection
to
the
state
commissioner
4


of
elections
and
the
state
commissioner
shall
request
the
5


legislative
council
to
direct
the
legislative
services
agency
6


to
draw
a
new
county
supervisor
districting
plan
in
accordance
7


with
the
reasons
submitted
to
the
extent
they
are
consistent
8


with
the
requirements
for
county
supervisor
districting
plans.
9


The
bill
provides
that
the
second
plan
shall
be
imposed
on
the
10


county
by
the
state
commissioner.
11


The
bill
makes
additional
changes
to
relocate
provisions
12


relative
to
the
consideration,
review,
approval,
and
13


imposition
of
county
supervisor
districting
plans
by
the
state
14


commissioner
of
elections

331.210A.
