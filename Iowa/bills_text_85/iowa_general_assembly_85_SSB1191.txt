LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
the
relationships
that
2


humans
develop
with
other
members
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
3


are
taken
into
homes
and
maintained
as
pets
are
unique
and
4


special.
These
relationships
can
enrich
lives
and
increase
5


happiness.
Even
after
the
death
of
a
pet,
human
attachment
to
6


the
memory
of
the
pet
often
remains
very
strong
and
many
people
7


feel
the
need
to
memorialize
the
love
felt
for
the
animal
by
8


burying
the
pet
in
a
pet
cemetery.
Pet
cemeteries
and
their
9


owners
and
operators
have
a
special
responsibility
to
customers
10


who
have
entrusted
pet
remains
to
them.
These
pet
cemeteries
11


have
a
duty
to
act
in
an
ethical
and
lawful
manner
to
prevent
12


grieving
pet
owners
from
experiencing
further
emotional
pain
13


or
financial
manipulation.
Perpetrations
of
fraud
against
14


grieving
pet
owners
are
unconscionable.
15


2.
The
general
assembly
further
finds
that
the
people
16


of
this
state
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
establishment,
17


maintenance,
and
preservation
of
pet
cemeteries
and
pet
18


crematoriums
and
the
proper
operation
of
the
businesses
and
19


individuals
that
own
and
manage
the
business.
This
chapter
is
20


determined
to
be
an
exercise
of
the
police
powers
of
this
state
21


to
protect
the
well-being
of
citizens
of
this
state,
to
promote
22


the
public
welfare,
to
promote
the
health
of
the
public,
and
23


to
prevent
pet
cemeteries
and
pet
crematoriums
from
falling
24


into
disrepair
and
dilapidation
and
becoming
a
burden
upon
the
25


community.
