who
is
providing
competent
private
instruction
10


to
that

provided
the
person
has
a
valid
driver’s
license
that
permits
12


unaccompanied
driving
and

a
clear
driving
record
for

child.
“Qualified

The

20


qualified
parent
are
the
same
as
the

currently
21


applicable

a

parent.
The
22


classroom
instruction
requirements
for
the
alternative
course
23


of
instruction
are
substantially
the
same
as
for
an
approved
24


course
of
instruction
offered
by
a
public
school
district
or
25


private
or
commercial
driver
education
school,
with
additional
26


requirements
for
40,
rather
than
20,
hours
of
street
or
highway
27


driving
including
night
driving.
The
course
of
instruction
28


must
be
a
course
approved
by
the
department
of
transportation
29


by
rule
and
use
driver
education
materials
that
meet
or
30


exceed
standards
established
for
driver
education
courses
31


approved
for
public
or
private
schools.
A
list
of
approved
32


courses
is
to
be
posted
on
the
department
of
transportation’s
33


internet
site.
In

the
student
to
qualify
for
an
34


intermediate
driver’s
license,
