EXPLANATION
11


This
bill
creates
an
uninsured,
hit-and-run,
and
12


underinsured
motor
vehicle
coverage
trust
fund
under
the
13


control
of
the
commissioner
of
insurance.
Moneys
in
the
14


fund
are
to
be
used
to
reimburse
insurers
for
claims
paid
15


under
uninsured
or
hit-and-run
motor
vehicle
coverage
and
16


underinsured
motor
vehicle
coverage
provided
with
motor
vehicle
17


liability
insurance
policies.
The
bill
directs
the
insurance
18


commissioner
to
adopt
administrative
rules
establishing
19


a
process
by
which
insurers
may
qualify
and
apply
for
20


reimbursement
from
the
fund.
In
order
to
make
the
distribution
21


of
payments
as
equitable
as
possible
among
insurers,
the
22


commissioner
is
authorized
to
establish
a
limit
on
the
amount
23


of
reimbursement
allowed
for
any
claim.

Under

bill,
the
source
of
revenue
for
the
uninsured,
25


hit-and-run,
and
underinsured
motor
vehicle
coverage
trust
fund
26


is
the
revenue
derived
by
cities
and
counties
from
automated
27


traffic
law
enforcement
programs.
The
bill
directs
that,
from
28


the
civil
fines
collected
by
a
city
or
county
from
the
use
of
29


automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems,
the
amount
necessary
30


to
satisfy
the
contractual
obligations
relating
to
the
use
of
31


the
systems
shall
be
retained
by
the
city
or
county.
Moneys
32


in
excess
of
that
amount
are
to
be
forwarded
monthly
to
the
33


treasurer
of
state
for
deposit
in
the
uninsured,
hit-and-run,
34


and
underinsured
motor
