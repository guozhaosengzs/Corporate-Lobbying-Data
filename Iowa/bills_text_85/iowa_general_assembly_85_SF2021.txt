provides
for
offenses
relating
to
the

of
animals
1


other
than
livestock,
any
game,
fur-bearing
animal,
fish,
2

amphibian
not

Code

section
717B.3A
provides
for
the
offense
of
animal
torture.
A
5


person
commits
the
offense
by
inflicting
severe
physical
pain
6


with
a
depraved
or
sadistic
intent
to
cause
prolonged
suffering
7


or
death.
The
law
provides
for
a
number
of
exceptions,
8


including
exceptions
based
on
actions
consistent
with
animal
9


husbandry
practices;
veterinary
practice;
hunting,
trapping,
or
10


fishing;
self-defense
or
protection
of
property;

The
severity
of
the

penalty
depends
on
whether
it
is
12


a
first
or
subsequent
offense.
For
the
first
offense,
the
13


person
is
guilty
of
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
In
addition,
14


the
person
must
complete
a
community
work
requirement.
For
a
15


second
or
subsequent
offense,
a
person
is
guilty
of
a
class
16


“D”
felony.
However,
there
is
no
community
work
requirement.
17


In
both
instances,
the
sentencing
order
must
provide
that
18


the
person
submit
to
psychological
evaluation
and
treatment.
19


The
law
also
provides
that
the
juvenile
court
has
exclusive
20


original
jurisdiction
in
a
proceeding
concerning
a
child
work
21


requirement.
The
juvenile
court
cannot
waive
jurisdiction
in
a
22


proceeding
concerning
an
offense
alleged
to
have
been
committed
23


by
a
child
under
the
age
of
17.
