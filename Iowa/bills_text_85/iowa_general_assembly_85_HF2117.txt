EXPLANATION
9


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


This
bill
requires
that
new
school
buses
ordered
for
12


purchase
on
or
after
July
1,
2014,
be
equipped
with
safety
13


belts
and
safety
harnesses
for
every
seating
position.
The
14


bill
also
requires
the
use
of
such
safety
belts
and
safety
15


harnesses
by
the
driver
and
passengers
on
school
buses
so
16


equipped.
Current
requirements
for
the
use
of
child
restraint
17


systems
for
children
under
18
years
of
age
also
apply
for
18


school
buses
equipped
with
safety
belts
and
safety
harnesses
19


under
the
bill.
20


A
violation
of
seat
belt
requirements
is
a
scheduled
21


violation
subject
to
a
fine
of
$50.
A
violation
of
seat
belt
22


or
restraint
requirements
for
persons
under
18
years
of
age
is
23


a
scheduled
violation
subject
to
a
fine
of
$100.
Seat
belt
and
24


restraint
violations
are
not
a
factor
in
establishing
grounds
25


for
license
suspension
or
identifying
a
person
as
a
habitual
26


violator.
27


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
28


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
29


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
30


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
31


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
32


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
33


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
