This

roadway.
Current
law
prohibits
parking
with
the

left-hand

to
the
left-hand
curb
unless
the
17


roadway
is
a
one-way
roadway.
The
bill
permits
a
political
18


subdivision
of
the
state
to
adopt
an
ordinance
allowing
a
19


vehicle
to
be
parked
on
a
roadway
with
the
left-hand
wheels
20


adjacent
to
and
within
18
inches
of
the
left-hand
curb
if
21


the
political
subdivision
deems
it
safer
than
parking
on
the
22


right-hand
side
of
the
street
during
periods
of
snow,
sleet,
23


or
freezing
rain
