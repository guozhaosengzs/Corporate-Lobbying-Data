WHEREAS,

eliminated
the
Chief
Administrative
Law
3


Judge’s
position
responsible
for
the

and
allegedly
directing
the

Administrative
Law
Judges
to
conduct

7


manner
favorable

thereby
interfering
with
8


their
ability
to
impartially
judge
cases
as

9


by
federal
law;
and
10


WHEREAS,
during
Governor
Branstad’s
current
11


administration
the
employment
of
state
employees
has
12


been
terminated
through
the
use
of
personnel
settlement
13


agreements
that
contain
confidentiality
clauses
14


attempting
to
force
state
employees
to
maintain
the
15


confidentiality
of
facts,
circumstances,
and
terms
16


related
to
the
settlement
agreements,
with
additional
17


compensation
offered

WHEREAS,
the

20


pursuant
to
a
recent

records
law
request,
21


has
released
a
list
of
hundreds
of
workers
who
are
22


disqualified
from
future
employment
because
they
were
23


discharged
or
resigned
before
termination,
a
practice
24


which
has
been
concealed
from
the
public
and
often
from
25


workers
on
the
list;
and
26


WHEREAS,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
standing
Committee
on
27


Government

to
act
as
the
investigative
arm
of

the

the

10


the
unenforceable
use
of
confidentiality
clauses
11


in
personnel
settlement
agreements
in
the
executive
12


branch,
and
the
secret
disqualifying
of
former
state
13

have
not
been
as
thoroughly
investigated
14


as
anticipated,
and
therefore
these

remain
15


unresolved;
and
16


WHEREAS,
additional
investigation
