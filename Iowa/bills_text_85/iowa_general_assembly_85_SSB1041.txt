Under
the
bill,
when
a
complaint
is
filed
pursuant
to
Code
5


section
232.28
that
a
juvenile
has
committed
a
delinquent
act,
6


the
juvenile
court
intake
officer
making
a
preliminary
inquiry
7


into
the

of
the
complaint.

provides
that
a

of
age
or
13


younger
may
be
placed
on
youthful
offender
status
pursuant
to
14


the
procedures
of
Code
section

requires
such
a
hearing
if
the
court
believes
a
transfer
24


to
juvenile
court
may
be
appropriate.

law
also
does
25


not
permit
the
court
to
place
a
juvenile
on
youthful
offender
26


status
if
the
juvenile
has
been
excluded
from
the
jurisdiction
27


of

serious
offense.
28


The
bill
permits

juvenile
excluded

29


of
the

transferred

Current
law
requires
a
juvenile

the
juvenile
court
for
a
33


serious
offense
to
be
placed
in
