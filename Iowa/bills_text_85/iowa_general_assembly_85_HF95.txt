EXPLANATION
1


This
bill
concerns
an
exemption
from
motor
vehicle
window
2


transparency
standards
for
certain
light-sensitive
persons.
3


Under
current
law,
the
front
windshield,
side
windows,
and
4


any
sidewings
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
driver
must
not
5


be
excessively
dark
or
reflective
so
that
it
is
difficult
6


for
a
person
to
see
into
the
motor
vehicle
from
the
outside.
7


Pursuant
to
administrative
rules,
“excessively
dark
or
8


reflective”
means
that
the
window
does
not
meet
a
minimum
9


standard
of
transparency
of
70
percent
light
transmittance.
10


In
the
past,
a
person
with
a
severe
light-sensitive
condition
11


could
apply
to
the
department
of
transportation
for
an
12


exemption
from
the
minimum
standard
of
transparency
if
the
need
13


was
documented
by
a
physician.
However,
recent
amendments
to
14


administrative
rules
provide
that
effective
July
4,
2012,
new
15


exemptions
shall
not
be
granted
and
any
prior
exemption
will
16


expire
when
the
vehicle
to
which
the
exemption
applies
is
no
17


longer
used
for
the
transport
of
the
passenger
or
driver
who
is
18


the
subject
of
the
exemption.
19


The
bill
restores
the
ability
of
a
person
who
suffers
from
20


a
medical
condition
causing
a
severe
sensitivity
to
light
to
21


apply
for
an
exemption
from
the
minimum
measurable
standard
22


of
transparency.
The
person
applying
for
the
exemption
23


must
submit
a
signed
statement
from
a
physician,
on
a
form
24


provided
by
the
department,
describing
the
applicant’s
medical
25


condition
and
light
sensitivity.
The
approved
application
26


must
be
carried
in
the
exempt
motor
vehicle
at
all
times.
The
27


department
is
required
to
adopt
rules
concerning
the
minimum
28


standard
of
transparency
for
exempt
vehicles,
the
duration
of
29


an
exemption,
and
requirements
for
the
termination
or
transfer
30


of
an
exemption
upon
transfer
of
ownership
of
a
motor
vehicle.
31


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
motor
vehicle
window
32


transparency
requirements
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
33


a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
