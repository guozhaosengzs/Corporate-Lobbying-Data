The
amount
of
business
16


income
apportioned
to
Iowa
is
generally
in
the
same
percentage
17


as

25


income
to
Iowa
in
the

proportion
that
the
Iowa
population
26


served
by
its
broadcasting
bears
to
the
total
population
27


served
by
its
broadcasting.
The
calculation
is
made
using
all
28


residents
of
the

individually
elect
to
receive
the
30


broadcasts.

shall
be
in

from

derived
