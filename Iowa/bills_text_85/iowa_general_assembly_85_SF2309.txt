an
individualized

determination
that
the
mandatory
minimum
applies
to
the
2


defendant’s
sentence,
the
court
shall
sentence
the
person
in

the

sentence
as

in
Code

that
a

8


who
commits
a
class
“A”
felony
including
murder
in
the
first
9


degree
and
who
was
under

that

Current
law
specifies
if
the
13


person
commits
a
class
“A”
felony
other
than
murder
in
the
14


first
degree
the
person
shall
serve
a
mandatory
minimum
of
25
15


years
in
prison
prior

Current
16


law
also
specifies
that
if
a

commits
murder
in
the
first
17


degree
and
is
under
18
years
of
age
at
the

the

was
18


committed
the
person
is
not
eligible
for
parole.
However,
the
19


United
States
Supreme
Court
in
a
recent
ruling
in
Miller
v.
20


Alabama
prohibited
life
sentences
without
the
possibility
of
21


parole
for
a
juvenile
who
commits
murder.
22


In
making
the
individualized
determination
the
court
shall
23


consider
the
same
aforementioned
factors
for
the
applicability
24


of
mandatory
minimum
sentences.
25


Under
the
bill,
if
the
court
makes
an
individualized
26


determination
that
the
person
shall
not
be
eligible
for
parole
27


as
specified
by
Code
section
902.1(2)
in
the
bill,
the
court
28


shall
sentence
the
person
in
the
following
manner
with
respect
29


to
the
class
“A”
felony:
to
serve
a
term
of
confinement
as
30


specified
by
the
court
prior
to
being
eligible
for
parole,
or
31


to
serve
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole
32


pursuant

section
