which

held

the

manner
as
the
original
proceedings,

until
all
22


affected
property
owners
agree
in
writing
to
the
change.
23


The
adoption
of
a
resolution
of
necessity
is
a
legislative
24


determination
that
the
improvement
is
expedient
and
proper
and
25


that
property
assessed
will
be
specially


individually

this
determination
of

of
Code
chapter

384,

in
Code
section
26


384.37
to
mean
the
lots
or
parts
of
lots
within
boundaries
of
27


a
benefited
area
established
by
the
council
for
the
purpose
28


of
the
assessment
of
all
or
part
of
the
cost
of
a
public
29


improvement
that
is
intended
in
whole
or
in
part
to
principally
30


serve
the
benefited
area
and
to
provide
an
individual
benefit
31


to
and
be
accessible
for
use
by
such
lots
or
parts
of
lots.
32


The
bill
provides
that
assessments
to
private
property,
33


as

total
benefit
of
the

public
improvement.
2


The
bill
requires
that
before
a
city
initiates
procedures
3


to
determine
the
amount
of
benefit
that
will
be
conferred
4


upon
private
property
as
the
result
of
a
public
improvement
5


for
which
a
special
assessment
will
be
imposed
and
prior
to
6


the
adoption
of
a
preliminary
resolution
related
to
a
public
7


improvement,
a
city
must
adopt
a
master
ordinance,
after
8


specified
notices
and
a
hearing,
setting
forth
the
methodology
9


and
procedure
to
be
used
by
the
city
for
all
future
special
10


assessments
in
determining
the
amount
of
individual
benefit,
11


area
benefit,
and
community
benefit
that
will
result
from
a
12


public
improvement
and
a
description
of
the
manner

improvement.
The
bill
specifies
additional
information
that
21


must
be
included
in
the
preliminary
resolution.
22


The
bill
strikes
the
provision
of
Code
section
384.54
that
23


designated
the
cost
of
all
court
proceedings
to
be
a
legitimate
24


item
of
expense
in
connection
with
a
public
improvement
and
25


allowed
such
costs
to
be
included
within
the
final
assessment
26


against
any
property
specially
benefited
in
the
assessment
27


district.
28


The
bill
specifies
that
the
total
cost
of
a
public
29


improvement,
except
for
certain
paving
near
railroad
tracks
30


or
improvements
to
be
otherwise
paid,
may
be
assessed
against
31


all
lots
within
the
assessment
district
in
accordance
with
the
32


individual
benefits
conferred
upon
the
property,
and
not
in

excess
of
such
benefits.
The
bill
provides

result
of

the
community
benefit
and
shall
be
paid
by
the
2


city.
3


The
bill
allows
a
lot
that
is
subject
to
a
special
assessment
4


to
be
divided
into
two
or
more
lots
for

purposes
5


upon

owner
in

separate
existing

sites
from
those
portions
of
the

7


that
are
used
for
agricultural
purposes
or
vacant

The
bill
designates
certain
public
improvements
that
are
10


presumed
to
confer
an
individual
benefit
and
designates

11


public
improvements
that
are

a
community
benefit
and
all

15


employee
salary

The
bill
requires
each
city
undertaking

18


construction
of
a
public

that
includes

22


improvement
in
order
to
determine
the
individual
benefits
and
23


the

24


The
bill
provides
that
those
portions
of

The

specifies
that
the
individual
benefit
accruing
7


to
each

within
the
district
as
the
result
of
the
street
8

shall
