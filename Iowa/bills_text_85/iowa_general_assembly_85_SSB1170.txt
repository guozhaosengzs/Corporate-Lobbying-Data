all
of

following:
25


(1)
After

EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
contains
new
and
modified
provisions
relating
to
8


the
regulation
of
insurance
company
holding
systems.
The
bill
9


repeals
current
provisions
relating
to
such
regulation.
10


The
bill
defines
“control”
over
a
person
to
provide
that
11


the
presumption
of
control
over
a
person
may
be
rebutted
by
12


a
showing
that
control
does
not
in
fact
exist.
However,
the
13


commissioner
may,
after
notice
and
hearing,
determine
that
14


control
does
exist,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
presumption
to
15


that
effect.
16


The
bill
also
includes
a
new
definition
of
“enterprise
risk”
17


which
means
any
activity,
circumstance,
event,
or
series
of
18


events
involving
one
or
more
affiliates
of
an
insurer
that,
if
19


not
remedied
promptly,
is
likely
to
have
a
material
adverse
20


effect
upon
the
financial
condition
or
liquidity
of
the
insurer
21


or
the
insurer’s
insurance
holding
company
system,
as
a
whole.
22


The
bill
authorizes
a
domestic
insurer,
either
on
its
own
or
23


in
cooperation
with
one
or
more
persons,
to
organize
or
acquire
24


one
or
more
subsidiaries.
A
subsidiary
may
conduct
any
kind
25


of
business,
not
limited
by
the
fact
that
it
is
a
subsidiary
of
26


a
domestic
insurer.
The
bill
limits
the
investment
authority
27


of
domestic
insurers
and
in
relation
to
their
subsidiaries,
as
28


specified
in
the
bill.
29


The
bill
sets
forth
requirements
for
acquisition
of
control
30


of
or
merger
with
a
domestic
insurer.
A
person
shall
not
31


propose
to
acquire,
control,
or
merge
with
a
domestic
insurer
32


without
filing
a
statement
with
the
commissioner
of

in
a
domestic
13

after
a

hearing
and
upon

that

If

Every

is

A

the
commissioner
unless
the

is
disallowed

within
30

The

the

ultimate
controlling

The

filing
a

with

11


of

discussing
the

The
