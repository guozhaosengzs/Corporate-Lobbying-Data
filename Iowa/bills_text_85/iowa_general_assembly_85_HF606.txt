development
located
in
an
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
if
1


the
board
determines
that
the
area
is
in
need
of
improvements.
2


A
rural
improvement
zone
is
governed
by
a
board
of
trustees
and
3


is
authorized
to
enter
into
contracts
and
incur
indebtedness
4


to
provide
funds
for
the
costs
of
improvements,
levy
a
standby
5


property
tax
upon
taxable
property
within
the
zone,
and
divide
6


property
tax
revenue
from
the
zone
in
the
same
manner
as
an
7


urban
renewal
area
under
Code
chapter
403.
8


This
bill
provides
that
the
board
of
supervisors
may
9


designate
an
area
to
be
a
rural
improvement
zone
if,
in
10


addition
to
other
considerations
under
current
law,
the
board
11


determines
that
the
use
of
incremental
property
taxes
would
12


not
have
a
substantial
detrimental
effect
on
other
taxing
13


districts.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
decision
of
the
14


board
to
establish
a
rural
improvement
zone
or
to
disallow
the
15


petition
shall
be
given
deference
by
any
reviewing
court.
16


The
bill
prohibits
a
rural
improvement
zone
from
acquiring
17


real
estate
by
condemnation
and
prohibits
a
governmental
entity
18


with
condemnation
authority
from
exercising
such
authority
on
19


behalf
of
a
rural
improvement
zone
or
for
a
purpose
related
to
20


the
activities
of
a
rural
improvement
zone.
21


The
bill
requires
each
rural
improvement
zone
board
of
22


trustees
to
consider
the
use
of
other
funding
sources
for
23


improvement
projects
prior
to
approving
a
resolution
to
provide
24


for
the
use
of
incremental
property
taxes.
In
addition,
each
25


board
of
trustees
is
encouraged
to
limit
the
reliance
on
and
26


use
of
incremental
property
taxes.
27


Current
Code
section
357H.10
provides
that
a
rural
28


improvement
zone
is
dissolved
upon
the
adoption
of
a
resolution
29


of
the
board
of
trustees
which
specifies
that
all
improvements
30


have
been
made
in
the
zone
and
all
indebtedness
has
been
paid.
31


In
addition,
current
law
provides
that
upon
dissolution
all
32


assets
of
the
rural
improvement
zone
shall
be
deeded
to
a
33


nonprofit
corporation
whose
members
are
property
owners
of
the
34


improvement

the
rural
improvement
zone
was
previously
extended
by
the
12


board
of
supervisors
under
the
bill.

bill
provides
that
13


if
a
rural
improvement
zone
is
dissolved
by
operation
of
the
14


bill
and
indebtedness
of
the
zone
remains
unpaid
on
the
date
15


of
dissolution,
such
indebtedness
shall
be
assumed
by
and
16


become
an
indebtedness
of
the
nonprofit
corporation
to
which
17


the
zone’s
assets
are
deeded.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
18


collection
of
the
property
tax
authorized
under
Code
section
19


357H.8(4)
and
the
division
of
taxes
authorized
under
Code
20


section
357H.9
shall
cease
immediately
upon
dissolution
of
the
21


rural
improvement

22


The
