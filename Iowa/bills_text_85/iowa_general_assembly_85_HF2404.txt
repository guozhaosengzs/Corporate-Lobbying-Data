If

of
public
improvement,

of

in

from
other
lands
in
the
district
and
from

the

in
the

in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
13


the
land
of
any
further
benefits
from
the
improvement,
or
in
14


some
manner
to
divide
the
benefits
that
may
be
derived
from
15


two
separated
portions
of
the
improvement,
then
the
board
16


of
supervisors
or

an
order
to

lands
so
deprived

20


benefits
from
the
district
without
any
reclassification,

21


may
subdivide
the
district
into
two
separate
entities
if
the
22


public
improvement
splits
the

each
of
which
may
still
derive
some
separate
benefits
from
the

separated
portions

If
the
public
improvement
is
such
as
to
leave
two
26


separate
portions
of
the
improvement
that
are
still
operable
27


and
of
benefit
to
the
land
on
each
side
of
the
division
made
by

the
public
improvement,
then
the
board
may
divide
the
district
29


into
two
separate
units
so
that
each
may
perform
further
work
30


on
the
improvements
in
their
respective
parts,

neither
31


shall
be
charged
for
work
completed
on
the
opposite
side
of
32


the
new
improvement
that
divides
them
and
may
only
be
charged
33


for
the
work
done
in
that
portion
of
