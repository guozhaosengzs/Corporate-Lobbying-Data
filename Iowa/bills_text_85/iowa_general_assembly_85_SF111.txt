EXPLANATION
5


Current
Iowa
law
prohibiting
the
sale,
operation,
or
6


possession
of
a
radar
jamming
device
applies
only
to
certain
7


devices
which
are
designed
or
used
to
interfere
with
radio
8


waves
emitted
by
devices
used
by
peace
officers
to
measure
the
9


speed
of
motor
vehicles.
10


This
bill
expands
the
current
law
to
apply
to
a
broader
11


range
of
devices
that
interfere
with
radar
speed
meters
and
12


laser
speed
meters.
The
bill
defines
“speed
detection
jamming
13


device”
to
mean
any
active
or
passive
device,
instrument,
14


mechanism,
or
equipment
that
is
designed
or
intended
to
15


interfere
with,
disrupt,
or
scramble
the
radar
or
laser
that
is
16


used
by
a
peace
officer
to
measure
the
speed
of
motor
vehicles.
17


The
definition
excludes
equipment
that
is
legal
under
federal
18


communications
commission
regulations,
such
as
a
citizens’
band
19


radio,
a
ham
radio,
or
other
similar
electronic
equipment.
20


The
bill
specifies
that
its
provisions
do
not
apply
to
21


speed
measuring
devices
purchased
by,
held
for
purchase
for,
22


or
operated
by
peace
officers
in
performance
of
their
official
23


duties.
24


Under
the
bill,
the
sale,
operation,
or
possession
of
a
speed
25


detection
jamming
device
is
prohibited
when
the
device
is
in
a
26


vehicle
operated
on
a
highway
in
this
state
or
held
for
sale
in
27


this
state.
A
speed
detection
jamming
device
sold,
operated,
28


or
possessed
in
violation
of
the
bill
may
be
seized
by
a
peace
29


officer
and
is
subject
to
forfeiture,
as
is
currently
the
case
30


for
radar
jamming
devices.
31


Currently,
a
violation
relating
to
radar
jamming
devices
is
32


a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100.
33


That
same
penalty
applies
for
violations
relating
to
speed
34


detection
jamming
devices
under
the
bill.
