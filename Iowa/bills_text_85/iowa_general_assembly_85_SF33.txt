EXPLANATION
20


This
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
engaging
in
a
distracting
21


activity
while
operating
a
motor
vehicle.
22


The
bill
repeals
Code
section
321.276,
which
prohibits
a
23


person
from
using
a
hand-held
electronic
communication
device
24


to
write,
send,
or
read
a
text
message
while
driving
a
motor
25


vehicle.
The
Code
section
is
only
enforceable
as
a
secondary
26


action
when
a
peace
officer
stops
or
detains
a
driver
for
a
27


suspected
violation
of
another
motor
vehicle
law.
A
violation
28


is
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$30,
with
higher
penalties
29


applicable
if
the
violation
causes
serious
injury
to
or
the
30


death
of
another
person.
A
violation
may
not
be
considered
by
31


the
department
of
transportation
for
purposes
of
suspending
32


a
person’s
driver’s
license
or
determining
a
person
to
be
a
33


habitual
offender.
34


The
bill
establishes
the
broader
offense
of
driving
while
35

S.F.

engaged
in
a
distracting
activity,
which
is
defined
to
mean
any
1


activity
that
is
not
immediately
necessary
to
the
operation
2


of
the
motor
vehicle
and
that
impairs,
or
could
reasonably
3


be
expected
to
impair,
the
person’s
ability
to
drive
safely.
4


The
bill
specifies
that
the
use
of
a
wireless
telephone
is
a
5


distracting
activity.
The
bill
does
not
apply
to
a
driver
6


when
the
motor
vehicle
is
at
a
complete
stop
off
the
traveled
7


portion
of
the
roadway,
and
the
bill
does
not
apply
to
members
8


of
public
safety
agencies
while
engaged
in
the
performance
of
9


official
duties.
10


Under
the
bill,
driving
while
distracted
is
enforceable
as
a
11


primary
offense,
but
may
not
be
considered
by
the
department
12


of
transportation
for
purposes
of
driver’s
license
suspensions
13


or
habitual
offender
determinations.
A
person
convicted
14


of
driving
while
distracted
commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
15


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$30.
If
the
violation
causes
16


serious
injury
to
another
person,
the
court
may
impose
an
17


additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspension
of
the
person’s
driver’s
18


license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
violation
19


causes
the
death
of
another
person,
the
court
may
impose
an
20


additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
21


license
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or
both.
22


Under
current
law,
young
drivers
who
have
an
instruction
23


permit,
an
intermediate
license,
a
special
minor’s
license
24


(school
license),
or
a
restricted
license
to
travel
to
and
from
25


work
are
prohibited
from
using
an
electronic
communication
26


device
or
an
electronic
entertainment
device
while
driving.
27


A
violation
is
not
considered
a
moving
violation,
but
is
28


considered
to
be
a
violation
of
the
restrictions
of
the
29


driver’s
license,
punishable
by
license
sanctions
in
addition
30


to
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
The
bill
does
not
affect
this
31


current
law
relating
specifically
to
the
use
of
electronic
32


devices
by
young
drivers.
The
new
provisions
under
the
bill
33


prohibiting
distracted
driving
would
also
apply
to
young
34


drivers.
