EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
relates
to
informal
conferences
on
contested
7


citations
in
health
care
facilities
or
assisted
living
8


programs.
Currently,
the
director
of
the
department
of
9


inspections
and
appeals
assigns
a
representative
of
the
10


department
who
was
not
involved
in
the
contested
citation
11


to
hold
an
informal
conference
with
a
health
care
facility
12


within
10
working
days
after
receipt
of
a
request
made
by
the
13


facility
to
contest
a
citation.
The
bill
would
require
that
14


an
independent
reviewer
would
hold
the
informal
conference
15


rather
than
a
representative
of
the
department
of
inspections
16


and
appeals.
The
bill
provides
that
the
independent
reviewer
17


must
be
an
Iowa-licensed
attorney
and
must
have
experience
or
18


training
in
geriatric
long-term
care.
19


The
bill
also
adds
the
informal
conference
process
20


for
assisted
living
programs
that
receive
a
regulatory
21


insufficiency.
Current
law
allows
assisted
living
programs
22


to
request
an
informal
review
of
contested
regulatory
23


insufficiencies,
but
does
not
provide
for
an
informal
24


conference.
The
bill
provides
that
an
independent
reviewer
25


must
be
provided
to
hold
an
informal
conference
within
10
26


working
days
after
the
request
by
an
assisted
living
program.
27


The
independent
reviewer
may
affirm
or
modify
or
dismiss
the
28


regulatory
insufficiency
at
the
end
of
the
informal
conference.
29


The
reviewer
must
provide
written
specific
reasons
for
the
30


decision
and
immediately
transmit
the
copies
to
the
department
31


of
inspections
and
appeals
and
to
the
program.
If,
after
32


receiving
the
reviewer’s
statement,
the
program
no
longer
33


wishes
to
contest
the
decision,
the
program
shall
comply
with
34


the
payment
of
any
civil
penalty.
