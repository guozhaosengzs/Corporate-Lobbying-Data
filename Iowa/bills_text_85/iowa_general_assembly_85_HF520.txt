EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
relates
to
the
policy
administration
of
the
3


election
and
voter
registration
laws
by
the
secretary
of
state.
4


The
bill
requires
that
the
county
commissioner
of
elections
5


post
notice
of
all
elections
filings
received
for
county,
city,
6


and
school
elections.
7


The
bill
requires
that
the
county
commissioner
of
8


registration
accept
completed
voter
registration
forms
from
9


registrants
who
are
at
least
17
years
of
age.
Current
law
10


requires
the
county
commissioner
of
registration
to
accept
such
11


forms
from
registrants
who
are
at
least
17
and
one-half
years
12


of
age.
These
provisions
of
the
bill
take
effect
January
1,
13


2014.
14


In
2008,
Code
section
49.21,
relating
to
designation
of
15


polling
places,
eliminated
language
regarding
accessibility
to
16


elderly
persons
and
retained
language
regarding
accessibility
17


to
persons
with
disabilities.
The
bill
strikes
the
same
18


language
referring
to
accessibility
to
elderly
persons
at
19


voting
centers,
to
conform
with
Code
section
49.21.
20


The
bill
requires
that
any
authority
supported
by
taxation
21


under
the
laws
of
Iowa
make
space
available
for
the
training
22


of
precinct
election
officials
and
other
election
personnel
23


upon
the
application
of
the
county
commissioner
of
elections.
24


The
bill
requires
that
the
commissioner
only
schedule
and
25


conduct
such
training
courses
at
locations
that
are
accessible
26


to
and
functional
for
persons
with
