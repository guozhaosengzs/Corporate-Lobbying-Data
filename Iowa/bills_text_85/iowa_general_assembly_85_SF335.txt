EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
companies
23


that
operate
motor
vehicles
and
employ
drivers
for
the
24


transportation
of
railroad
workers.
25


Under
the
bill,
the
term
“employer”
means
a
person
engaged
26


in
a
business
affecting
interstate
commerce
who
owns
or
leases
27


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
or
assigns
employees
to
operate
28


a
commercial
motor
vehicle,
including
a
railroad
worker
29


transportation
company.
The
term
“employee”
refers
to
a
driver
30


who
performs
a
service
for
a
railroad
worker
transportation
31


company,
either
for
wages
or
as
an
independent
contractor.
32


The
bill
requires
an
employer
to
provide
for
annual
33


inspection
of
the
employer’s
motor
vehicles
by
a
qualified
34


person.
In
addition,
each
employee
who
drives
a
motor
vehicle
35

S.F.

must
complete
a
daily
written
vehicle
report.
An
employer
is
1


also
required
to
establish
a
maintenance
and
repair
program
2


that
includes
weekly
inspection
of
each
motor
vehicle,
with
a
3


focus
on
cleanliness
and
the
condition
of
vehicle
parts
and
4


accessories
specified
in
the
bill.
An
employer
is
required
to
5


maintain
records
relating
to
vehicle
maintenance
and
repair
for
6


one
year,
or
for
a
vehicle
no
longer
in
the
employer’s
control,
7


for
six
months.
8


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
drives
a
motor
vehicle
9


transporting
railroad
workers
is
subject
to
hours-of-service
10


restrictions
similar
to
those
that
apply
to
commercial
11


vehicle
operators.
The
bill
prohibits
a
driver
from
driving
12


for
more
than
10
hours
following
eight
consecutive
hours
of
13


uninterrupted
rest;
prohibits
driving
such
a
motor
vehicle
14


for
any

hours
of
uninterrupted
rest;
and
16


prohibits
accepting
a
call
for
service
during
a
period
of
17


uninterrupted
rest.
The
bill
provides
detailed
definitions
18


of
“on
duty”
and
“uninterrupted
rest”.
A
driver
who
violates
19


the
hours-of-service
restrictions
commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
20


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
This
is
the
same
21


penalty
that
currently
applies
for
hours-of-service
violations
22


by
commercial
vehicle
operators.
23


The
bill
prohibits
an
employer
from
requiring
a
driver
to
24


operate
a
motor
vehicle
in
violation
of
the
hours-of-service
25


requirements
established
under
the
bill.
An
employer
may
26


require
a
period
of
uninterrupted
rest
at
any
time
and
must
27


clearly
communicate
to
a
driver
when
a
period
of
uninterrupted
28


rest
is
to
begin.
29


The
bill
requires
an
employer
to
maintain
a
driver
30


qualification
file
for
each
employee
that
includes
specified
31


documentation
relating
to
the
employee’s
driving
record
32


and
employment
record.
The
bill
states
that
an
employee
is
33


disqualified
from
driving
for
an
employer
if
the
driver
is
34


convicted
of
two
or
more
serious
traffic
violations
committed

tested
13


for
alcohol
and
controlled
substances
following
an
accident
14


occurring

in
the
amount
of

up
