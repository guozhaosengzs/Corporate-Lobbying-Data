A
Joint
Resolution
requesting
the
call
of
a
constitutional
1


convention
in
order
to
propose
an
amendment
to
the
2


Constitution
of
the
United

to
allow
Congress

to
prohibit
or
otherwise
regulate
the
expenditure
4


of
funds
for
political
speech
by
any
corporation,
limited
5


liability
company,
or
other
corporate
entity.
6


WHEREAS,
by
a
ruling
of
the
United
States
supreme
court,
7


a
corporation,
limited
liability
company,
or
other
type
of
8


corporate
entity
is
now
accorded
greater
rights
of
political
9


activity
than
was
previously
lawful;
and
10


WHEREAS,
those
rights
now
allow
a
corporation,
a
limited
11


liability
company,
or
other
type
of
corporate
entity
to
use
12


general
treasury
funds
to
make
independent
expenditures
for
13


electioneering
communications
or
for
speech
that
expressly
14


advocates
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
candidate
for
public
15


office;
and
16


WHEREAS,
this
ruling
overturns
a
century
of
legislative
17


and
judicial
determinations
making
a
distinction
between
the
18


political
free
speech
of
natural
persons
and
political
activity
19


by
corporate
entities;
and
20


WHEREAS,
a
corporate
entity
has
far
greater
economic
21


resources
than
does
a
natural
person
and
may
use
those
22


resources
to
advance
political
ideas;
and
23


WHEREAS,
restriction
and
regulation
of
corporate
political
24


activity
is
essential
to
prevent
domination
of
the
political
25


process
by
corporate
entities;
NOW
THEREFORE,
26


BE
IT
RESOLVED
