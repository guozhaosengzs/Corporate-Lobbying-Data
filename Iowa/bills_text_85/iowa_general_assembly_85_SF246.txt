EXPLANATION
25


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
a
number
of
provisions
relating
26


to
the
functions
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
27


stewardship.
28


DIVISION
I
——
SOIL
AND
WATER
CONSERVATION
DISTRICTS.
The
29


bill
amends
a
provision
which
establishes
a
conservation
30


practices
revolving
loan
fund
within
the
soil
conservation
31


division,
to
be
used
only
to
make
loans
directly
to
owners
32


of
land
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
new
permanent
soil
33


and
water
conservation
practices.
The
bill
provides
that
34


revolving
loan
fund
moneys
may
be
used
in
combination
with
35

public
cost-sharing
moneys.
The
bill
increases
the
amount
that
1


an
owner
may
receive
under
the
program
from
$10,000
to
$20,000.
2


DIVISION
II
——
WEIGHTS
AND
MEASURES.
The
bill
amends
a
3


provision
that
requires
the
department
to
designate
one
of
4


its
assistants
to
act
as
the
state
metrologist
of
weights
5


and
measures.
Specifically,
the
bill
provides
that
such
6


designation
is
discretionary.
7


DIVISION
III
——
MOTOR
FUEL
STANDARDS.
The
bill
amends
a
8


number
of
provisions
relating
to
motor
fuel
standards
(Code
9


section
214A.2).
It
eliminates
octane
standards
for
leaded
10


gasoline.
11


The
bill
also
provides
for
gasoline
that
contains
a
certain
12


percentage
of
ethanol.
Ethanol
blended
gasoline
is
designated
13


E-xx
where
“xx”
is
the
volume
percent
of
ethanol
in
the
ethanol
14


blended
gasoline.
15


Currently,
the
term
“standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline”
16


refers
to
ethanol
blended
gasoline
that
is
used
to
power
17


vehicles
other
than
flexible
fuel
vehicles
(Code
section
18


214A.1).
Generally,
standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline
must
19


contain
between
9
and
10
percent
ethanol
by
volume
(so-called
20


E-10).
However,
it
may
also
contain
a
higher
percentage
as
21


authorized
by
the
department
as
long
as
it
is
approved
by
the
22


United
States
environmental
protection
agency
(EPA)
(Code
23


section
214A.2).
The
bill
provides
that
such
gasoline
is
for
24


use
in
gasoline-powered
vehicles
not
required
to
be
flexible
25


fuel
vehicles.
It
also
increases
the
percentage
of
ethanol
26


allowed
in
standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline
to
15
percent
27


by
volume
(E-15).
The
department
may
still
increase
the
28


percentage
if
authorized
by
the
department
with
approval
by
the
29


EPA.
30


The
department
is
required
to
test
samples
of
motor
fuel
or
31


biofuels
to
ensure
that
they
comply
with
the
standards.
It
32


increases
the
maximum
sample
size
from
16
fluid
ounces
to
one
33


gallon
(Code
section
214A.7).
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
34


allowing
a
retail
dealer
of
motor
fuel
to
post
a
notice
showing
35


-5-

the
results
of
the
tests
(Code
section

1


The
bill
amends
a
provision
which
requires
a
decal
be
affixed
2


to
a
motor
fuel
pump
notifying
consumers
that
it
is
dispensing
3


ethanol
blended
gasoline
(Code
section
214A.16).
The
bill
4


provides
that
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
ethanol
blended
5


gasoline
containing
a
percentage
of
ethanol
ranging
between
11
6


and
15
percent
(E-11
to
E-15)
must
be
affixed
with
a
decal
as
7


prescribed
by
EPA.
8


DIVISION
IV
——
PESTICIDE
REGULATION.
The
bill
amends
a
9


provision
which
requires
a
commercial
applicator
of
pesticides
10


to
be
licensed.
Such
person
must
provide
evidence
of
financial
11


security
(Code
section
206.13).
The
evidence
of
financial
12


responsibility
is
an
established
amount
for
property
damage
13


and
public
liability
insurance.
In
2012,
the
General
Assembly
14


enacted
SF
2311
(2012
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1095)
which
increased
15


the
amount
from
$50,000
to
$250,000.
This
bill
decreases
that
16


amount
to
$100,000
and
allows
for
liability
insurance
with
a
17


limit
of
$100,000
per
occurrence
and
$300,000
annual
aggregate.
