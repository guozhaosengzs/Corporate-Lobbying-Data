EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


BACKGROUND.
In
2011,
the
general
assembly
enacted
SF
531
4


(2011
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
113)
which
provides
for
the
regulation
5


and
promotion
of
renewable
fuels.
In
part,
the
Act
established
6


an
E-15
plus
gasoline
promotion
tax
credit
which
began
on
July
7


1,
2011,
and
is
due
to
be
eliminated
on
January
1,
2018
(Code
8


sections
422.11Y
and
422.33(11D)),
and
a
biodiesel
producer
9


refund
which
applied
on
and
after
January
1,
2012,
and
is
due
10


to
be
eliminated
on
January
1,
2015
(Code
section
423.4(9)).
11


E-15
TAX
CREDIT.
The
E-15
plus
gasoline
promotion
tax
12


credit
is
calculated
on
the
total
gallons
of
ethanol
blended
13


gasoline,
classified
as
E-15
and
higher,
and
sold
and
dispensed
14


by
a
retail
dealer
(see
Code
section
214A.1)
during
each
15


quarter.
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
equals
a
constant
16


(designated)
rate
multiplied
by
the
total
number
of
gallons
of
17


E-15
or
higher
sold
and
dispensed
by
the
retail
dealer
during
18


a
calendar
year
assuming
the
retail
dealer’s
tax
year
is
on
a
19


calendar
year
basis.
A
designated
rate
of
3
cents
applies
to
20


each
calendar
year
from
2012
through
2014.
The
designated
rate
21


is
then
reduced
to
2
cents
which
will
apply
to
each
calendar
22


year
from
2015
through
2017
when
the
tax
credit
expires.
The
23


same
calculations
are
applied
to
retail
dealers
whose
tax
24


years
are
not
based
on
a
calendar
year
(701
IAC
42.46).
The
25


bill
revises
the
designated
rate
for
three
periods
of
time
26


within
a
tax
year
(either
based
on
a
calendar
or
alternative
27


fiscal
year).
For
the
first
period
(January
1
through
May
31),
28


the
rate
is
3
cents;
for
the
second
period
(June
1
through
29


September
15),
the
rate
is
10
cents;
and
for
the
third
period
30


(September
16
through
December
31),
the
rate
returns
to
3
31


cents.
This
revision
takes
effect
upon
enactment
of
the
bill
32


and
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
2014.
33


BIODIESEL
PRODUCER
REFUND.
A
biodiesel
producer
is
34


engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
biodiesel
which
is
a
renewable

fuel
derived
from
vegetable
oils
or
animal
fats
for
use
in
1


biodiesel
blended
fuel;
an
alternative
to
diesel
fuel
(Code
2


section
214A.1).
The
amount
of
the
refund
equals
a
constant
3


(designated)
rate
multiplied
by
the
total
number
of
gallons
4


of
biodiesel
produced
by
the
biodiesel
producer
in
this
state
5


during
each
quarter
of
a
calendar
year.
The
biodiesel
producer
6


receives
the
refund
amount
after
subtracting
any
amount
of
7


sales
or
use
tax
owed
by
the
biodiesel
producer
(701
IAC
8


12.18).
In
addition,
a
biodiesel
producer
cannot
claim
a
9


refund
on
more
than
25
million
gallons
of
biodiesel
produced
10


during
a
calendar
year
at
any
one
manufacturing
facility.
A
11


designated
rate
of
3
cents
applied
to
calendar
year
2012.
The
12


designated
rate
was
reduced
to
2.5
cents
for
calendar
year
2013
13


and
to
2
cents
for
calendar
year
2014
after
which
it
expires.
14


The
bill
extends
the
period
in
which
the
2-cent
rate
applies
15


for
five
additional
calendar
years
through
2019.
