the

Currently,
the

5


blended

ethanol
blended

6


sold
in
this

2014,
the
tax
rate
7


for
both

will
be
20

on
special

for
diesel
10


engines
of

This

engines
of
motor

with
13

14


The

will
15


be
a

18

and
under

circumstances,
the
rate
determined
under
the

engines
of
motor
29

established
on
the
effective
date
of
the
Act
30


in
the
same
manner
as
the

a
percentage
of
the

of
a

32


that
