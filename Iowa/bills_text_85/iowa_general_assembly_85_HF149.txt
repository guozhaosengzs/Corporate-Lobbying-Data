The

defines
several
terms
including
“family

and

“sick

The
bill
provides
that
all

shall

right

use
sick

The
formula
for

is
contained
in
the
bill,
and
there
are
7


limits
for
the
amount
of
sick
and
safe
time
an
employee
may
8


accrue
per
year,
unless
the
employer
sets
a
higher
limit.
9


The
formula
for
accruing
sick
and
safe
time
and
the
10


limitations
and
exceptions
are
provided
in

Code
section
11

Sick

time
shall
begin
to
accrue

new
12


employees
on
the
first
day
of
work
and
for
existing
employees
13


on
July
1,
2013.
New
employees
may
use
accrued
sick
and
safe
14


time
starting
the
60th
day
of
employment.
Existing
employees
15


may
use
sick
and
safe
time
as
it
accrues.
Sick
and
safe
time
16


shall
carry
over
each
year,
but
an
employee
may
not
use
more
17


than
144
hours
of
sick
and
safe
time
per
year.
18


An
employer
who
provides
a
leave
policy
that
meets
the
19


minimum
accrual
requirements
and
the
same
minimum
uses
and
20


conditions
is
deemed
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
bill.
The
21


bill
does
not
require
employees
to
be
reimbursed
for
unused
22


sick
and
safe
time
upon
separation
from
employment.
However,
23


if
an
employee
is
moved
or
transferred
within
the
company,
24


the
employee
shall
retain
all
accrued
sick
and
safe
time
and
25


may
use
such
time
immediately.
If
there
is
an
employment
26


separation,
but
an
employee
is
rehired
within
three
months,
all
27


accrued
sick
and
safe
time
shall
be
reinstated
upon
rehire
and
28


be
available
for
immediate
use.
An
employer
has
the
discretion
29


to
advance
sick
and
safe
time
to
an
employee.
30


The
bill
provides
specific
reasons
for
which
employees
may
31


use
the
sick
and
safe
time
in
new
Code

An
32


employee
shall
give
reasonable
notice
to
an
employer
when
33


use
of
sick

time
is
foreseeable.

employer
is
responsible
for
paying
any
costs
charged
to
the
7


employee
to
receive
the

An

An

including
the
right
11


to
use

and
safe
time
and
to
file
a
complaint
against
12


an
employer,
and
the
prohibitions
against
an

13


retaliation
against
an

are
14


explained

notice
of
their
16


rights
to
sick
and
safe
time
as
described
in
new
Code
section
17


91F.7,
either
by
supplying
each
employee
with
a
notice
or
18


by
posting
such
notice
in
an
accessible
and
obvious
place
19


where
employees
work.
Violations
of
the
notice
and
posting
20


requirements
may
result
in
a
civil
penalty
of
not
more
than
21


$100
for
each
offense.
22


An
employee
may
recover
the
monetary
value
of
owed
sick
23


and
safe
time
plus
liquidated
damages
for
the
wrongful
denial
24


of
use
of
accrued
sick
and
safe
time
if
an
employer
is
shown
25


to
have
intentionally
violated
the
bill
pursuant
to
new
Code
26


section
91F.8.
27


An
employer
must
retain
records
documenting
hours
worked
by
28


each
employee
and
the

of
sick
and
safe
time
taken
by
the
29


employees
for
five
years.
The
labor
commissioner
shall
have
30


reasonable
access
to
these
records.
If
a
question
arises
about
31


an
employee’s
right
to
sick
and
safe
time
and
an
employer
does
32


not
have
adequate
records
or
does
not
allow
the
commissioner
to
33


examine
the
employer’s
records,
the
commissioner
shall
presume
34


that
the
employer
has
violated
the
bill.

chapter
does
not
prohibit
14


an
employer
from
providing
a
more
generous
sick
and
safe
time
15


policy,
does
not
diminish
an
employer’s
previous
contractual
16


obligations
for
more
generous
sick
and
safe
time,
and
does
not
17


diminish
public
employees’
rights
to
sick
and
safe
time
as

provided
by
law.

The
bill
encourages
employers
to

and
safe
20


time
as
defined
in
the
bill
to
their

that
is
compensated
at
the
22


same
hourly
rate
and
with
the
same
benefits,
including
health
23


care
benefits,
as
the

normally
earns
during

24


worked.
25


The

of
public
health,
in
consultation
26


with
the

is
to
create
a
poster
and
other
27


informational
materials
which
an
employer
may

employer
provides
sick
and
safe
time
to
all
29


employees
in
each
establishment
where
the
poster
and
other
30


informational
materials
