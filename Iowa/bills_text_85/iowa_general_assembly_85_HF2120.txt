22


This

directs
the
department
of
human
services
(DHS)
23


to
convene
a
workgroup
of
stakeholders
with
interest
or
24


expertise
in
issues
relating
to
elders
to
develop
a
section
25


1915(i)
Medicaid
state
plan
amendment
to
provide
home
and
26


community-based
services
(HCBS)
to
eligible
elders.
The
27


workgroup
is
directed
to
make
recommendations
on
or
before
28


September
1,
2014,
relating
to
financial
eligibility;
benefits,
29


including

Medicare
and
Medicaid
services
of
the
United
States
department

of
health
and
human

for
approval.
2


The
1915(i)
state
plan
amendment
option
under
the
federal
3


Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
allows
states
4


to
provide
HCBS
to
eligible
individuals
without
requiring
5


the
individuals
to
meet
the
institutional
level
of
care
6


criteria.
Rather,
an
individual
must
meet
a
needs-based
7


criteria
specified
by
the
state
that
is
less
restrictive
8


than
the
state’s
institutional
level
of
care
criteria.
The
9


ACA
provision
also
allows
states
to
expand
the
scope
of
10


allowable
services;
allows
states
to
provide
a
specific
set
11


of
HCBS
benefits
to
a
targeted
population
group;
allows
the
12


use
of
increased
income
eligibility
up
to
300
percent
of
the
13


supplemental
security
income
(SSI)
federal
benefit
level;
and
14


allows
states
to
provide
full
Medicaid
state
plan
benefits
to
15


those
eligible
for
the
1915(i)
HCBS
option.
Because
the
HCBS
16


option
is
based
on
a
state
plan
amendment
rather
than
a
waiver,
17


the
HCBS
must
be
offered
to
all
eligible
individuals
on
a
18


statewide
basis.
The
state
cannot
limit
the
number
of
eligible
19


individuals,
establish
a
waiting
list
for
these
individuals,
or
20


limit
services
to
only
specified
areas
of
the
state.
