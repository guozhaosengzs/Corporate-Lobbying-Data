S.F.
2243


This
bill
amends
Code
section
321.306,
which
contains
1


requirements
for
driving
a
vehicle
on
a
roadway
that
has
been
2


divided
into
three
or
more
clearly
marked
traffic
lanes.
The
3


bill
provides
that
the
requirements
apply
on
any
roadway
4


with
clearly
marked
traffic
lanes,
regardless
of
the
number
5


of
lanes.
Currently,
the
requirement
to
drive
as
nearly
as
6


practical
entirely
within
a
single
lane
is
combined
with
the
7


requirement
not
to
move
from
the
lane
until
the
driver
has
8


first
ascertained
that
the
movement
can
be
made
safely.
The
9


bill
separates
those
two
requirements
and
makes
semantic
10


changes
to
the
language
of
the
Code
section.
11


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
12


Code
section
321.306
is
a
simple
misdemeanor,
punishable
by
a
13


scheduled
fine
of
$100.
A
violation
that
causes
serious
injury
14


to
or
the
death
of
a
person
may
be
subject
to
an
additional
fine
15


and
driver’s
license
suspension.
