In

,
an

4


arising

a

person’s

EXPLANATION
17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


This
bill
relates
to
the
statute
of
repose
period
in
a
20


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
21


improvement
to

22


The
bill
reduces
the
15-year
statute
of
repose
period
in
a
23


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
24


improvement
to
real
property
to
eight
years.
Such
cases
are
25


based
upon
an
injury
to
property
or
an
injury
or
death
of
a
26


person.
27


A
statute
of
repose
period
differs
from
a
statute
of
28


limitations
period
in
that
a
statute
of
repose
period
29


establishes
a
time
period
after
which
a
lawsuit
based
upon
30


negligence
in
an
improvement
to
real
property
cannot
be
filed
31


regardless
of
whether
an
injury
to
a
person
or
to
property
has
32


occurred.
A
statute
of
limitations
period
begins
at
the
date
33


of
the
injury
or
upon
discovery
of
the
deficiency.
34


The
bill
applies
to
actions
filed
on
or
after
the
effective
