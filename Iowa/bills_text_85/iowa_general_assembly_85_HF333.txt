This

established
prior
to
the

chapter
11


1190
(SF
2378)
which
increased
the
fines.
12


The
bill
strikes
a
duplicative
fine
amount
for
a
violation
13


of
Code
section
321.437
(mirrors)
that
existed
prior
to
the
14


enactment
of
Senate
File
2378,
and
establishes
the
fine
at
$25.
15


The
bill
also
adds
the
following
scheduled
violations
16


and
fines
enacted
during
the
2010
legislative
session:
$30
17


scheduled
fine
for

of
an
electronic
communication
device
18


while

(Code
section

$30
19


scheduled
fine
for
text
messaging

and
a

scheduled
fine
for
actions
against
a
21


person
on
a
bicycle
(Code
section

22


The
bill
does
not
modify
the
changes
made
during
the
2011
23


and
2012
legislative
sessions
to
Code
section
805.8A(13)(f)
24


which
relate
to
carriers
operating
an
interstate
transportation
25


service
for
compensation
upon
the
highways
of
this
state.
26


The
bill
also
does
not
modify
the
changes
made
during
