The

which
is
sought

fetus,
uses
force
or
the
threat
9


of

in
writing
that
the
physician
16


is
not
performing
the
abortion
based
on
the
gender
of
the
fetus
17


and
has
no
knowledge
that
the
woman
seeking
the
abortion
is
18


seeking
the
abortion
based
upon
the
gender
of
the
fetus.
A
19


copy
of
the
written
certification
is
required
to
be
maintained
20


in
the
woman’s
medical
record.
21


The
bill
provides
that

upon
whom
a
gender-selection
22


abortion
is
performed
in
violation
of
the
bill,
or
the
spouse
23


of
the
woman,
may
maintain
a
civil
action
against
the
physician
24


who
performed
the
abortion
in
violation
of
the
bill
for
actual
25


damages,
and
provides
for
awarding
of
reasonable
attorney
