EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
includes
provisions
relating
to
programs
and
7


services
under
the
purview
of
the
department
on
aging
(IDA).
8


The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
relating
to
the
duties
9


of
the
administrator
of
the
investigations
division
of
the
10


department
of
inspections
and
appeals.
The
provision
directs
11


the
administrator
to
coordinate
investigations
relative
to
the
12


operations
of
IDA.
The
language
potentially
conflicts
with
the
13


autonomy
of
the
office
of
state
long-term
care
ombudsman.
14


The
bill
amends
the
language
relating
to
confidential
15


records
under
the
purview
of
IDA.
The
bill
replaces
the
16


protection
of
records
of
IDA
pertaining
to
only
one
program,
to
17


instead
protect
documents
maintained
by
IDA
or
the
office
of
18


long-term
care
ombudsman
that
identify
a
complainant,
resident,
19


or
individual
pertaining
to
assistance
provided
by
IDA,
an
area
20


agency
on
aging,
or
the
office,
unless
otherwise
exempt
from
21


confidentiality
protections.
22


The
bill
changes
the
term
“resident
advocate”
to
ombudsman
23


throughout
the
Code,
removes
references
to
“care
review
24


committee”,
which
no
longer
exists,
and
changes
references
in
25


the
Code
to
conform
with
changes
made
with
the
enactment
of
26


Code
section
231.45
by
the
2012
general
assembly
by
replacing
27


“resident
advocate
committee”
with
“certified
volunteer
28


long-term
care
ombudsman”
throughout
the
Code.
29


The
bill
includes
new
definitions
for
“long-term
care
30


ombudsman”,
“options
counseling”,
and
“tenant”
in
Code
chapter
31


231
(department
on
aging
——
older
Iowans);
includes
a
provision
32


establishing
that
area
agencies
on
aging
are
instrumentalities
33


of
the
state
based
on
a

of

of

and
includes
a
conforming
provision
to
the
provision
2


in
Code
chapter
97B
(Iowa
public

system

(IPERS))
in
Code
chapter
231
including
area
agencies
on

4


in
the
definition
of

under

5


The
bill
amends
provisions
relating
to
confidentiality
6


regarding
complaints
and
investigations,
and
relating
to
access
7


of
the
state
or
local
long-term
care
ombudsman
and
certified
8


volunteers
to
the
locations
of

as

as

records
of

and
11


tenants
of
these
entities
to
carry
out
their
duties,
consistent
12


with
the
federal
Older
Americans
Act.
13


The
bill
deletes
a
reference
to
the
economic
development
14


authority,
which
is
no
longer
involved
in
the
community
service
15


employment
program;
changes
the
terminology
relating
to
the
16


senior
internship
program,
which
has
been
replaced
by
the
older
17


American
community
service
employment
program;
and
aligns
18


provisions
relating
to
the
prevention
of
elder
abuse,
neglect,
19


and
exploitation
in
accordance
with
the
federal
Older
Americans
20


Act.
21


The
bill
repeals
Code
chapter
249H,
relating
to
the
senior
22


living
program,
but
retains
the
senior
living
revolving
loan
23


program
fund.
The
senior
living
trust
fund
was
depleted
at
the
24


end
of
FY
2011.
