EXPLANATION
26


This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
a
variety
of
27


matters
administered
by
the
department
of
transportation.
28


The
bill
amends
Code
section
22.7
to
provide
that
personal
29


information
contained
on
electronic
driver’s
license
or
30


nonoperator’s
identification
card
records
that
is
provided
by
31


the
licensee
or

holder
for
use
by
certain
law
enforcement
32


and
medical
personnel
responding
to
or
assisting
with
an
33


emergency
constitutes
a
confidential
record.
34


The
bill
provides
that

coverage
card
required
to
be
carried
in
a
motor
vehicle
may

be
produced
in
paper
or
electronic
format.
An
electronic

image
displayed
on
the
screen
of
a
cellular
telephone
or
other
3


portable
electronic
device
with
a
touch
screen
or
miniature
4


keyboard
is
an
acceptable
electronic
format.
The
bill
allows
5


insurance
companies
to
issue
a
financial
liability
coverage
6


card
in
paper
format
or,
at
the
request
of
the
insured,
in
7


electronic
format.
8


Under
current
law,
commercial
vehicles
operated
in
9


interstate
commerce
are
registered
by
the
department
on
a
10


staggered
schedule
for
registration
years
determined
by
the
11


department.
This
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“registration
12


year”
in
Code
section
321.1
and
related
provisions
in
Code
13


sections
321.26
and
321.106
to
permit
staggered
registration,
14


at
the
option
of
the
owner,
for
any
motor
truck
registered
for
15


six
tons
or
more.
Code
section
321.134
is
amended
to
include
16


business-trade
trucks
in
provisions
allowing
for
semiannual
17


payment
of
registration
fees.
18


Under
current
law,
a
person
is
disqualified
from
operating
19


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
if
the
person
has
two
or
more
20


convictions
within
a
three-year
period
for
certain
specified
21


offenses
committed
while
operating
a
commercial
motor
vehicle,
22


or
committed
while
operating
a
noncommercial
motor
vehicle
and
23


holding
a
commercial
driver’s
license
if
the
convictions
result
24


in
a
sanction
of
the
person’s
driving
privileges.
Code
section
25


321.208
is
amended
to
add
texting
and
using
a
hand-held
mobile
26


telephone
in
violation
of
a
state
or
local
law
while
operating
27


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
to
that
list
of
specified
offenses.
28


Currently,
the
owner
of
a
vehicle
may
increase
the
gross
29


weight
registration
of
a
vehicle
by
paying
the
difference
30


between
the
fee
for
the
higher
gross
weight
and
the
fee
for
the
31


gross
weight
for
which
the
vehicle
is
registered.
Beginning
32


in
the
seventh
month
of
a
registration
year,
the
gross
weight
33


registration
fee
is
determined
by
prorating
the
difference
in
34


the
fee
for
the
remaining
months.
Under
the
bill,

H.F.

of
the
fee
applies
at
any
time
in
the
registration
year
1


that
the
owner
applies
for
an
increased
weight
registration.
2


However,
if
the
owner
has
a
conviction
or
action
pending
for
3


a
weight
registration
violation,
the
fee
for
increased
weight
4


registration
is
the
difference
between
the
annual
fee
for
the
5


higher
gross
weight
and
the
fee
for
the
gross
weight
at
which
6


the
vehicle
is
registered.
7


Under
current
law,
a
person
whose
driver’s
license
is
8


revoked
upon
conviction
of
a
second
offense
of
operating
while
9


intoxicated
may
apply
for
a
temporary
restricted
license
45
10


days
after
the
effective
date
of
revocation
if
the
person
11


submitted
to
chemical
testing,
and
90
days
after
revocation
12


if
the
person
refused
testing.
The
issuance
of
a
temporary
13


restricted
license
is
conditioned
upon
the
installation
of
14


an
ignition
interlock
device
on
all
motor
vehicles
owned
15


or
operated
by
the
person.
At
the
end
of
the
period
of
16


revocation,
an
ignition
interlock
device
is
required
for
a
17


period
of
one
year,
unless
a
different
period
is
required
18


by
statute;
however,
an
ignition
interlock
device
is
not
19


required
for
reinstatement
if
the
person
had
a
temporary
20


restricted
license
during
the
revocation
period.
The
bill
21


amends
Code
sections
321J.17
and
321J.20
to
provide
that
a
22


person
is
required
to
maintain
an
ignition
interlock
device
23


for
one
year
or
longer
following
reinstatement.
The
one-year
24


period
is
reduced
by
any
period
of
time
the
person
held
a
25


valid
temporary
restricted
license
during
the
revocation
26


for
the
occurrence
from
which
the
arrest
arose.
A
person
27


is
prohibited
from
operating
any
motor
vehicle
not
equipped
28


with
an
ignition
interlock
device
during
the
period
in
which
29


a
device
is
required
to
be
maintained,
and
a
person
must
30


certify
installation
of
an
ignition
interlock
device
before
31


the
department
can
grant
reinstatement.
The
bill
also
strikes
32


a
provision
in
current
law
that
ties
the
permissible
use
of
33


certain
temporary
restricted
licenses
to
uses
permitted
under
34


federal
law.
Finally,
the
bill
strikes
the
current
requirement
35


-10-


LSB

H.F.

that
a
person
who
was
issued
a
temporary
restricted
license
1


must
submit
proof
of
deinstallation
of
an
ignition
interlock
2


device
as
a
condition
for
reinstatement
of
a
full
driver’s
3


license.
4


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
321M.9
5


requiring
the
auditor
of
state
to
conduct
periodic
studies
of
6


the
county
driver’s
license
issuance
program.
7


Code
section
321.116,
which
establishes
an
annual
8


registration
fee
of
$25
for
an
electric
motor
vehicle
up
to
9


five
model
years
old
and
a
fee
of
$15
thereafter,
is
repealed.
10


As
a
result,
electric
motor
vehicles
will
be
subject
to
11


registration
fees
based
on
the
weight
and
value
of
the
vehicle.
12


The
change
applies
for
registration
years
beginning
on
or
after
13


January
1,
2014.
However,
current
fees
will
continue
to
apply
14


to
registration
renewals
for
electric
motor
vehicles
registered
15


to
the
same
owner
for
a
registration
year
beginning
prior
to
16


January
1,
2014.
17


The
bill
repeals
a
provision
in
1984
Acts,
chapter
1229,
18


that
linked
the
contingent
repeal
of
Code
section
314.14,
as
it
19


existed
at
that
time,
to
the
repeal
or
expiration
of
a
federal
20


statute
relating
to
set-aside
contracts
for
disadvantaged
21


business
enterprises.
Due
to
subsequent
substantive
amendments
22


to
the
Code
section,
the
contingent
repeal
provision
is
no
23


longer
relevant.
