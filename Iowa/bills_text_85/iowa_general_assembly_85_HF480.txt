EXPLANATION
15


There
are
100
soil
and
water
conservation
districts
16


organized
in
this
state,
one
located
in
each
county
except
for
17


Pottawattamie
county
which
maintains
two
districts.
A
soil
18


conservation
district
is
associated
with
local
governments,
19


state
government,
and
the
federal
government,
including
locally
20


elected
district
commissioners
(Code
section
161A.5),
a
state
21


soil
conservation
committee
and
soil
conservation
division
22


established
within
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
23


stewardship
(DALS)
(Code
section
161A.4),
and
the
national
24


resource
conservation
service
(NRCS)
a
subagency
of
the
United
25


States
department
of
agriculture.
District
offices
are
staffed
26


by
an
NRCS
employee
and
sometimes
a
secretary
employed
by
the
27


DALS.
This
bill
appropriates
moneys
to
DALS
and
requires
28


that
the
agency
support
each
district
office
by
employing
one
29


full-time
secretary.
