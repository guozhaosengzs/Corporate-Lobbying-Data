who
11


operates
a
commercial
establishment
without
an
authorization
12


or
who
fails
to
meet
a
standard
of
care
is
guilty
of
a
simple
13


misdemeanor.
The
department

for
the
animals’
14


seizure
and
impoundment
and
they

BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
LICENSING.
The
bill
requires
all
19


commercial
establishments
to
obtain
a
license.
It
replaces
20


the
term
“state
license”
with
“license”.
It
provides
that
a
21


commercial
kennel
does
not
include
a
kennel
in
which
a
dog
or
22


cat
remains
in
the
custody
of
the
owner
or
the
dog
or
cat.
The
23


bill
creates
a
special
type
of
commercial
breeder’s
license
24


reserved
for
a
small
breeder,
competitive
show
breeder,
or
25


specialized
breeder.
26


BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
FEES.
The
bill
replaces
the
current
27


fee
assessed
on
commercial
establishments
with
a
system
28


consisting
of
a
base
amount
which
depends
on
the
type
of
29


commercial
establishment
obtaining
a
license.
A
single
30


base
amount
is
imposed
on
an
animal
shelter,
pound,
research
31


facility,
commercial
breeder
holding
a
special
type
of
license,
32


boarding

who
holds
a
special
type
of

or
specialized
4


breeder.
A
separate
scheduled
amount
applies
to
a
pet
shop.
5


The
scheduled
amount
is
computed
according
to
a
formula
which
6


increases
the
amount
due
based
on
the
number
of
dogs
or
cats
7


kept
on
hand
by
the
commercial
establishment.
In
the
case
of
8


a
commercial
breeder,
the
fee
is
based
on
the
total
number
of
9


dogs
or
cats
used
for
breeding.
In
the
case
of
a
pet
shop,
the
10


fee
is
based
on
the
number
of
dogs
or
cats
kept.
11


BILL’S
PROVISIONS
——
FUNDS.
The
moneys
from
fees
are
still
12


deposited

fund.
However,
up

to
$20,000
a
year
is
to
be
transferred
to
a
new
animal
rescue
14


remediation
fund
also
under

The
purpose
15


of
this
fund
is
to
reimburse
a
city
or
county,
referred

as
16


a
local
