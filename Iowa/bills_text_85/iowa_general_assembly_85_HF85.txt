This

relates
to
amounts
which
the
issuer
of
a
gift
21


certificate
may
deduct
from
the
face
value
of
the
certificate
22


based
on
the
failure
of
the
owner
to
present
the
certificate
23


for
payment
in
a
timely
manner.
24


Currently,
an
amount
may
not
be
deducted
unless
a
valid
and
25


enforceable
written
contract
exists
between
the
issuer
and
the
26


owner
of
the
gift
certificate
pursuant
to
which
the
issuer
27


regularly
imposes
charges
for
failure
to
present
and
does
not
28


regularly
reverse
or
otherwise
cancel
them.
The
bill
makes
29


this
provision
applicable
only
after
a
three-year
time
frame
30


has
elapsed
from
the
date
of
issuance
of
the
gift
certificate,
31


for
gift
certificates
issued
on
or
after

32


result
is

amount

of
a
gift
certificate
for
the

period
following

for
certificates
