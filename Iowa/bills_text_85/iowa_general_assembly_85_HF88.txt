EXPLANATION
31


This
bill
relates
to
a
right
of
subrogation
by
an
insurer
in
32


a
criminal
case.
33


The
bill
provides
that
an
insurer
has
the
right
of
34


subrogation
against
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
if
the
insurer

reimburses
the
victim
as
a
result
of
the
perpetrator’s
crime.
1


Under
the
bill,
an
insurer
may
also
be
considered
a
victim
of
2


the
perpetrator’s
crime
and
shall
be
included
in
the
statement
3


of
pecuniary
damages
to
victims
prepared
by
the
county
attorney
4


pursuant
to
Code
section
910.3.
5


Current
law
grants
the
crime
victim
compensation
fund
a
6


right
of
subrogation
against
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
but
7


prohibits
an
insurer
from
having
a
right
of
subrogation.
8


If
the
perpetrator
of
a
crime
makes
a
restitution
payment
9


through
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
under
the
bill,
Code
10


section
602.8107
specifies
that
the
insurer
be
reimbursed
after
11


all
other
restitution
and
costs
have
been
paid.
12


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
13


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
14


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
15


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
16


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
17


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
18


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
