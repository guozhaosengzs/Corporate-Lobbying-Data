Code

Until
the
expiration
of
the
minimum
applicable

is
given,
the

due,
which
is
described
in
the
notice

The
act
of

11


the

the
agreement
as
though
no
default

had
occurred,
except
as

3
.
However,


13


where
the
obligation
in
default
is
a
credit
card
account
that
14


has
been
closed,
the
act
of
curing
a
default
does
not
restore
15


to
the
consumer
the
consumer’s
rights
under
the
agreement
as
16


though
no
default
had
occurred.


17


Sec.

Section
537.5111,
Code
2013,
is
amended
by
adding

the
following

credit

21


conform
to
the
requirements
of
subsection
2,
and
a
notice
in
22


substantially
the
form
specified
in
that
subsection
complies
23


with
this
subsection
except
that
the
statement
relating
to
24


continuation
of
the
contract
upon
correction
of
the
default
as
25


though
the
consumer
did
not
default
shall
not
be
contained
in
26


the
notice.
