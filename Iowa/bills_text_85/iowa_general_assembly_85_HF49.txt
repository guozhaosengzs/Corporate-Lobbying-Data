EXPLANATION
5


BACKGROUND
——
TRANSFER
OF
JURISDICTION
TO
A
GOVERNING
BODY
6


OF
A
DRAINAGE
OR
LEVEE
DISTRICT.
When
a
drainage
or
levee
7


district
is
first
established,
it
is
managed
by
a
board
of
8


supervisors
in
the
county
where
the
district
is
located
or
9


by
a
joint
board
of
supervisors
if
the
district
extends
into
10


more
than
one
county
(Code
chapter
468,
subchapter
I,
part
11


1).
After
the
district
has
been
established,
the
board
of
12


supervisors,
or
joint
board
of
supervisors,
may
transfer
a
13


portion
of
its
jurisdiction
to
another
governing
body.
For
14


example,
in
some
cases,
a
city
may
assume
management
of
the
15


entire
district
(Code
chapter
468,
subchapter
II,
part
3).
In
16


another
case,
the
landowners
of
the
district
may
petition
the
17


county
or
counties
where
the
district
is
located
to
conduct
18


a
special
election
in
order
to
transfer
jurisdiction
of
the
19


district
to
a
three-member
board
of
elected
trustees
(Code
20


chapter
468,
subchapter
III).
In
that
case,
the
county
board
21


of
supervisors,
or
joint
board
of
supervisors,
conducts
an
22


initial
election
(Code
section
468.517)
and
the
board
of
23


trustees
conducts
subsequent
elections
(Code
section
468.521).
24


Where
a
district
contains
20,000
acres
or
more,
the
board
of
25


supervisors,
or
joint
board
of
supervisors,
may
divide
the
26


district
into
three
election
districts.
A
trustee
residing
in
27


each
election
district
is
elected
by
landowners
for
the
entire
28


district
(Code
section
468.504).
Ordinarily,
trustees
serve
29


for
staggered
three-year
terms
(Code
section
468.518)
except
30


for
trustees
in
districts
having
a
pumping
station
who
may
31


serve
concurrently
(Code
section
468.519).
32


BACKGROUND
——
TRANSFER
OF
MUTUAL
TERRITORY
FROM
ONE
DRAINAGE
33


OR
LEVEE
DISTRICT
TO
ANOTHER.
Two
or
more
drainage
or
levee
34


districts
may
share
mutual
territory.
The
district
which
35


-3-


LSB
1035YH

da/sc
3/
5



H.F.
49


has
jurisdiction
of
all
such
territory
is
referred
to
as
an
1


overlying
district
and
each
district
which
has
jurisdiction
2


of
a
portion
of
that
territory
is
referred
to
as
a
contained
3


district.
The
governing
body
of
a
contained
district
or
4


overlying
district
may
be
a
board
of
supervisors,
joint
5


board
of
supervisors,
or
board
of
trustees.
After
receiving
6


a
dissolution
petition,
the
governing
body
of
a
contained
7


district
must
conduct
an
election
to
dissolve
the
district
and
8


the
governing
body
of
the
overlying
district
may
conduct
a
9


hearing
and
accept
improvements
and
rights-of-way
surrendered
10


by
the
board
of
the
contained
district,
or
in
the
alternative,
11


conduct
an
election
of
land
users
(Code
chapter
468,
subchapter
12


I,
part
6).
13


BILL
——
SCOPE.
The
bill
establishes
a
new
process
for
the
14


election
of
trustees

a
new

overlying
15


district
accepts
all
improvements
and
rights-of-way
surrendered
16


by
a
board
of
supervisors
or
board
of
trustees
of
a
contained
17


district
(Code
sections
468.256
through
468.259),
if
the
new
18


district
includes
at
least
35,000
acres
with
a
pumping
station,
19


regardless
of
whether
the
new
district
is
located
in
more
than
20


one
county.

form

under

Code
sections

468.502
do
not
apply.
Instead,
27


the
board
of
trustees
currently
serving
for
the
overlying
28


district
is
responsible
for
conducting
the
election
of
29


trustees
to
the
new
district
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
30


board
of
trustees
initially
elected
under
the
supervision
of
31


a
board
of
supervisors,
or
joint
board
of
supervisors,
would
32


be
responsible
for
conducting
the
election
of
trustees
to
an
33


existing
district.
