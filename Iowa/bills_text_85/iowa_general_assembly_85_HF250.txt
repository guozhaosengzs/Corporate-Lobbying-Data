provides

The

for

vehicle
is
$10.

The

of
license
plates
to
be
issued
for
off-road
11


utility
vehicles
will
be
determined
by
the
department
of
12


transportation.
Because
off-road
utility
vehicles
are
13


currently
subject
to
sales
tax,
the
bill
provides
that
off-road
14


utility
vehicles
are
exempt
from
the
fee
for
new
registration
15


imposed
on
vehicles
subject
to
registration,
so
long
as
16


the
owner
has
paid
the
sales
tax
at
the
time
of
purchase.
17


Registration
with
the
department
of
transportation
does
not
18


exempt
the
owner
from
the
current
requirement
to
register
19


the
off-road
utility
vehicle
with
the
department
of
natural
20


resources.
21


The
bill
provides
that
an
off-road
utility
vehicle
22


registered
with
the
department
of
transportation
may
be
23


operated
on
secondary
roads,
but
not
on
primary
highways,
24


except
to
cross
over
a
primary
highway,
and
not
on
highways
25


within
the
corporate
limits
of
a
city.
26


The
bill
states
that
a
person
who
operates
an
off-road
27


utility
vehicle
on
a
highway
must
be
at
least
16
years
of
28


age
and
have
a
valid
driver’s
license
other
than
a
license
29


valid
only
for
the
operation
of
a
motorized
bicycle.
Iowa
30


motor
vehicle
laws
apply
to
the
operation
of
off-road
utility
31


vehicles
on
highways
except
those
equipment
provisions
which
32


by
their
nature
can
have
no
practical
application.
The
bill
33


specifies
that
the
operator
of
an
off-road
utility
vehicle
must
34


carry
proof
of
motor

financial

Under
current
law,
a
person
who
operates
an
off-road
utility
3


vehicle
on
a
highway
in
violation
of
current
restrictions
4


commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
5


$50.
The
bill
establishes
the
same
penalty
for
a
person
who
6


operates
a
registered
off-road
utility
vehicle
in
violation
of
7


minimum
age
and
licensing
requirements
or
on
a
highway
where
8


off-road
utility
vehicle
operation
is
not
authorized.

The
bill
makes
conforming
amendments
to
Code
chapter
321I,
10


relating
to
the
regulation
of
off-road
utility
vehicles
by
the

of

and
to
