1.
For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
unless
the
context
3


otherwise
requires:
4


a.
“Distributed
generation
facility”
means
a
biomass
5


conversion
facility,
a
solar
energy
conversion
facility,
or
a
6


wind
energy
conversion
facility
as
those
terms
are
defined
in
7


section
476C.1.
8


b.
“Net
metering”
means
the
interconnection
of
a
distributed
9


generation
facility
with
an
electric
utility
whereby
10


electricity
produced
by
the
facility
and
consumed
on-site
11


offsets
electricity
which
would
otherwise
be
purchased
from
the
12


utility,
and
excess
electricity
is
transferred
to
the
utility’s
13


electrical
grid.

Notwithstanding
section
476.44
or
any
other

at
reasonable
and
competitive
23


rates.
Any
