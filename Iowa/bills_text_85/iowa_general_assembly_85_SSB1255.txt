to
the
sales
tax
imposed
on
the
sale
of
7


tangible
personal
property
and
the
furnishing
of
enumerated
8


services
and
to
an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
the
State
9


of
Iowa
ratified
on
November
2,
2010,
dedicating
a
portion
of
10


state
revenue
for
purposes
of
benefiting
natural
resources,
11


outdoor
recreation,
and
soil
conservation
(Article
VII,
12


section
10).
The
amendment
authorizes
the
general
assembly
to
13


implement
its
provisions.
14


The
constitutional
amendment
creates
a
natural
resources
and
15


outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
(trust
fund)
within
the
state
16


treasury.
The
trust
fund
and
allocations
from
the
fund
are
17


codified
in
Code
chapter
461.
Moneys
in
the
trust
fund
cannot
18


be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
protecting
and
enhancing
19


water
quality
and
natural
areas
in
this
state
including
20


parks,
trails,
and
fish
and
wildlife
habitat,
and
conserving
21


agricultural
soils
in
this
state.
No
revenue
is
credited
to
22


the
trust
fund
until
the
sales
tax
rate
is
increased.
Whenever
23


the
rate
is
increased,
the
amount
generated
by
the
increase
is
24


credited
to
the
fund,
but
the
amount
credited
cannot
exceed
the
25


amount
that
a
rate
of
3/8
of
1
percent
would
generate.
26


Currently,
the
tax
on
sales
and
services
in
Iowa
is
imposed
27


at
the
rate
of
6
percent.
The
division
provides
for
an
28


increase
in
the
rate
to
6
and
3/8
percent,
and
the
transfer
of
29


these
moneys
into
the
trust
fund.
In
2012,
the
84th
General
30


Assembly
enacted
SF
2329
(2012
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1098)
which
31


provided
for
the
transfer
of
sales
tax
revenues
deposited
into
32


the
general
fund
of
the
state
(general
fund)
into
the
trust
33


fund
when
applicable.
The
division
provides
for
the
same
tax
34


rate
increase
to
the
use
tax.
