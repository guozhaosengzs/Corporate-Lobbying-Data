EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


This
bill
relates
to
the
redesign
of
mental
health
and
10


disabilities
services
(MH/DS)
administered
by
regions
comprised
11


of
counties.
Under
the
redesign
provisions
initially
enacted
12


in
2012,
each
organization
of
counties
as
a
region
is
governed
13


by
a
Code
chapter
28E
agreement
and
the
region
is
to
have
14


an
administrative
office,
organization,
or
entity
formed
by
15


agreement
of
the
counties
participating
in
the
region
to
16


function
on
behalf
of
those
counties,
known
as
the
regional
17


administrator
and
defined
in
Code
section
331.388.
The
18


redesign
legislation
maintained
the
financial
responsibility
19


for
MH/DS
with
each
county
but
provided
for
the
regional
20


administrator
and
the
regional
governance
board
to
assume
the
21


administrative
functions
on
behalf
of
the
county.
The
bill
22


makes
conforming
Code
amendments
relating
to
the
redesign
23


legislation.

In

person

6


changed
to
instead
refer

Prior
7


to
the
redesign,
MH/DS
services
in
each
county
were
delineated
8


in
a
service
management
plan
adopted
by
that
county,
subject
9


to
approval
by
the
department
of
human
services
(DHS).
These
10


individual
county
plans
are
to
be
replaced
by
a
regional
11


service

plan
effective
beginning
on
July
1,

County

However,
the
name

the
fund
14


was
changed
in
the
redesign
legislation
but
references
to
15


the
old
fund
in

Code
sections
are

in

In

Code
chapter

22


relating

mental
health
centers,
was
substantially
23


rewritten
by
2011
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
121,
and
the
revisions
took
24


effect
July
1,
2012.
In
the
rewrite,
Code
section
230A.107,
25


codified
the
waiver
authorization
for
a
for-profit
corporation,
26


nonprofit
corporation,

hospital
providing
mental

health
services
to
