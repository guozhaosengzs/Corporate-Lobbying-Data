11


commissioner
of

The

14


requires
that
the

18


the
oath
advise
both
persons
that
falsely
stating

attesting
19

a

is
a

A

no

an
attesting
person
is
prohibited
from
signing
23


any
additional

24


The
bill
provides
that
if
proof
of
identification
is

established
the

If
a
26


person
is

29


the
