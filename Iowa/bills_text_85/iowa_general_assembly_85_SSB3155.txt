The

is
5


equal
to
20
percent
of
the
regular
program
state
cost
per
pupil
6


multiplied
by
the
enrollment
increase.
7


The
incentive
state

is
required
to
be
used

defray
8


increases
in

may
include
renovation

The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined

section

The
bill
requires

the

of
15


any
state
mandate
included
in
the
bill
be
paid
by
a
school
16


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
17


school
district
under

The

18


deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
19


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
20


inclusion
of
this

to
comply
with
any

included
