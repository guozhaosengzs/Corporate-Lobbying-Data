Public
policy.
11


It
is
in
the
public
interest
that
public
improvements
12


are
completed
by
the
best
means
and
highest
quality
of
labor
13


reasonably
available,
and
that
workers
working
on
public
14


improvements
be
compensated
according
to
the
real
value
of
the
15


services
they
perform.
It
is
the
policy
of
this
state
that
the
16


wages
of
workers
working
on
public
improvements
should
be
at
17


least
equal
to
the
prevailing
wage
rates
paid
for
similar
work
18


by
responsible
contractors
in
the
community
as
a
whole
in
order
19


to
accomplish
all
of
the
following:
20


1.
Protect
workers
and
their
contractors
and
subcontractors
21


from
the
effects
of
serious
and
unfair
competition
resulting
22


from
wage
levels
detrimental
to
efficiency
and
well-being.
23


2.
Ensure
that
contractors
compete
with
one
another
24


on
the
basis
of
the
ability
to
perform
work
competently
25


and
efficiently
while
maintaining
community-established
26


compensation
standards.
27


3.
Recognize
that
local
participation
in
public
28


improvements
and
family
wage
income
and
benefits
are
essential
29


to
the
protection
of
community
standards.
30


4.
Encourage
training
and
education
of
workers
to
industry
31


skills
standards.
32


5.
Encourage
contractors
and
subcontractors
to
use
funds
33


allocated
for
employee
fringe
benefits
for
the
actual
purchase
34


of
those
benefits.

EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
requires
a
contractor
to
pay
workers
the
same
3


hourly
wage
plus
fringe
benefits
for
a
public
improvement
4


costing
more
than
$25,000
as
the
contractor
would
pay
workers
5


for
a
private
construction
or
improvement
project.
The
bill
6


allows
the
per-hour
wage
rate
to
be
based
on
what
is
normally
7


paid
in
the
area
by
contractors
for
similar
projects,
and
to
8


be
adjusted
on
a
yearly
basis
by
the
department
of
workforce
9


development.
10


The
wage
rates
that
the
workers
must
be
paid
shall
also
11


include
benefits
such
as
medical
care,
life
insurance,
overtime
12


pay,
and
vacation
and
holiday
pay.
The
bill
applies
to
any
13


public
improvement
that
receives
money
from
a
public
body
and
14


includes
most
types
of
public
improvements
from
construction
to
15


road
maintenance
to
painting
to
hauling.
16


The
labor
commissioner
determines
the
wage
rates
for
17


specific
geographical
areas
and
for
specific
crafts,
18


classifications,
and
types
of
workers.
This
information
must
19


be
posted
on
the
department
of
workforce
development’s
internet
20


site.
In
determining
what
the
wage
rate
for
a
worker
is,
the
21


commissioner
may
consult
collective
bargaining
agreements,
wage
22


rate
determinations
for
federal
projects
in
the
same
area,
and
23


other
information
the
department
may
receive
from
contractors
24


who
participate
in
an
apprenticeship
program
approved
by
the
25


federal
office
of
apprenticeship.
26


Any
person
affected
by
the
wage
rates
has
15
days
after
the
27


department
of
workforce
development
has
posted
the
wage
rates
28


on
its
internet
site
to
object
in
writing,
stating
the
specific
29


reason
for
the
objection,
to
the
labor
commissioner.
The
30


commissioner
must
reconsider
the
determination
being
objected
31


to,
and
either
affirm
or
modify
it
within
15
days
of
receiving
32


the
objection.
33


If
the
commissioner
declines
to
modify
the
determination,
34


within
10
days,
the
person
affected
may
submit
an
objection
35

H.F.

in
writing
to
the
division,
stating
the
specific
reasons
for
1


the
objection.
A
hearing
must
be
set
by
the
department
of
2


inspections
and
appeals
before
an
administrative
law
judge
3


within
45
days
after
the
objection
is
filed.
The
person
who
4


filed
the
objection
must
show
the
administrative
law
judge
5


that
the
wage
rate
was
somehow
made
in
error.
The
division
6


is
required
to
show
how
it
determined
the
wage
rate.
The
7


administrative
law
judge
must
make
a
decision
about
the
wage
8


rate
within
30
days
and
it
is
considered
a
final
determination.
9


The
bill
requires
that
contractors
and
subcontractors
not
10


pay
the
workers
less
than
the
established
wage
rate
but
does
11


not
prohibit
them
from
paying
the
workers
more
than
the
wage
12


rate.
The
wage
rate
must
be
paid
without
any
deductions
for
13


food,
sleeping
quarters,
use
of
tools,
or
safety
equipment.
14


The
bill
also
requires
the
public
body
to
monitor
the
15


contractors
and
subcontractors
to
ensure
that
the
wage
rate
16


is
paid.
A
call
for
bids
must
state
that
the
wage
rate
must
17


be
included
in
the
bids
for
the
public
improvement.
All
18


bids
shall
list
the
specific
wage
rates
for
each
craft,
19


classification,
and
type
of
worker
needed
for
the
public
20


improvement.
All
contractors
and
subcontractors
are
required
21


to
sign
a
contract
that
states
they
will
pay
workers
the
wage
22


rate
determined
by
the
division.
If
the
contractors
and
23


subcontractors
are
found
to
not
be
paying
the
wage
rate,
the
24


contract
states
that
the
contractor’s
or
subcontractor’s
right
25


to
work
on
the
public
improvement
and
get
paid
for
work
already
26


done
may
be
terminated.
27


Before
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
receives
the
final
28


payment
for
the
public
improvement,
the
public
body
overseeing
29


the
public
improvement
must
certify
the
bills
include
proper
30


amounts
due
the
workers,
and
the
contractor
or
subcontractor
31


must
swear
under
oath
that
the
records
are
accurate.
32


The
bill
does
not
apply
to
public
improvement
projects
33


funded
by
the
federal
government.
However,
unless
a
federal
34


provision
applies,
if
a

is
financed

The

at

about

27


After

the

shall
28


investigate

law
can
sue
for
the

The

10


is
brought
against
a

The

interested
party
has
a
right
of
20


action
on

of
any
individual
who
has
a
right
of
action
21


under
the
bill.
The
commissioner
may
file
a
lawsuit
in
trust
22


for

then
bring

action
23


to

be
required
to
pay
24


the

A

may
not
ask,

or
agree
26


to
give
back
any
part
of
a
worker’s
wages
or
thing
of
value
to
27


any
person
who
asserts
that
failing
to
do
so
will
prevent
the
28


worker
from
keeping
or
getting
work.
However,
this
provision
29


does
not
apply
to
authorized
labor
organization
representatives
30


collecting
dues
or
assessments.
31


In
addition
to
other
penalties
under
this
law,
anyone
who
32


attempts
to
get
a
worker
to
give
up
any
part
of
compensation
33


on
a
public
improvement
by
threat
not
to
hire
or
by
threat
of
34


firing
is
guilty
of

6


or
any

The

its
internet
site
of
contractors
and
10


subcontractors
who
have
violated
this
law
twice
within
a
11


three-year
period
and
notify
public
bodies
by
restricted
12


certified
mail.
13


A
contractor
or
subcontractor
who
has
been
notified
of
the
14


second
violation
has
10
days
to
request
a
hearing
before
an
15


administrative
law
judge.
If
no
hearing
is
requested,
the
16


contractor
is
barred
from
receiving
public
improvement
work
and
17


its
name
and
information
is
posted

of
22


apprenticeship
and
do
only
the

to
23


which

shall
be
paid
the

rate
the
same

any
25


other
worker.
26


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
27


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
28


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
29


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
30


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
31


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
32


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
33


The
bill
takes
effect
