EXPLANATION
9


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


This
bill
provides
an
exemption
from
motor
vehicle
12


registration
requirements
for
a
motor
vehicle
transferred
to
13


a
community
action
agency
for
donation
to
a
needy
individual.
14


As
a
result
of
the
exemption
from

the

fee
for
new

obtain
a
registration
receipt
and
17


registration

the
18


limited
purposes
of
driving
the
vehicle
for
maintenance
or
19


repair
or
to
demonstrate
the
vehicle
to
the
donee.
20


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
community
action
agency
21


that
accepts
a
donated
vehicle
would
have
to
obtain
a
new
22


certificate
of
title
for
the
vehicle.
However,
the
bill
23


exempts
such
a
community

payment
of
the
24


usual
$20
title
fee.
