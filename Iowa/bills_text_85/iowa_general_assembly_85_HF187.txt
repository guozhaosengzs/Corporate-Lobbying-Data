subsections

Code

are

1.
Purpose
——
findings
——
policy.
The
state
of
Iowa
is
6


committed
to
providing
all
students
with
a
safe
and
civil
7


school
environment
in
which
all
members
of
the
school
community
8


are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.
The
general
assembly
9


finds
that
a
safe
and
civil
school
environment
is
necessary
10


for
students
to
learn
and
achieve
at
high
academic
levels.
11


Harassing
and
bullying
behavior
can
seriously
disrupt
the
12


ability
of
school
employees
to
maintain
a
safe
and
civil
13


environment,
and
the
ability
of
students
to
learn
and
succeed.
14


Cyberbullying
is
an
especially
insidious
form
of
bullying
that
15


occurs
most
often
outside
school,
but
nonetheless
affects
the
16


school
process,
impeding
the
ability
of
students
to
learn
and


17


succeed.
School
districts
and
schools
should
be
wary
of
a
18


bully’s
ability
to
use
technology
to
reach
a
broad
audience,
19


frequently
anonymously.
Therefore,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
20


state
of
Iowa
that
school
employees,
volunteers,
and
students
21


in
Iowa
schools
shall
not
engage
in
harassing
or
bullying
22


behavior.
23


4.
Programs
encouraged.
The
board
of
directors
of
a
school
24


district
and
the
authorities
in
charge
of
each
accredited
25


nonpublic
school
are
encouraged
to
establish
programs
designed
26


to
eliminate
harassment
and
bullying
,
including
cyberbullying,


27


in
schools.
To
the
extent
that
funds
are
available
for
these
28


purposes,
school
districts
and
accredited
nonpublic
schools
29


shall
do
the
following:
30


a.
Provide
training
on
antiharassment
and
antibullying


31


policies


relating
to
the
policy
adopted
pursuant
to
subsection
32


3


to
school
employees
and
volunteers
who
have
significant
33


contact
with
students.

parent
25


or

who
promptly,
reasonably,
and
in
good
faith
reports
26


an
incident
of
harassment
or

27


The
bill
modifies
the
definition
of
“harassment”
and
28


“bullying”
to
add
gestures
to
the
behaviors
which
may
create

an

30


cyberbullying
in
