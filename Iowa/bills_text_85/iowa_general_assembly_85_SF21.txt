13


of
the

of
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system
14


on
the
approach
to
each
location
where
an
automated
traffic
15


law
enforcement
system
is
in

The
signage
must
be
in
16


conformance
with
the
uniform

The

of
an
automated
traffic
18


law
enforcement
system
being
used
for
speed
limit
enforcement
19


must
be
positioned
or
posted
at
a
distance
in
advance
of
the
20


automated
traffic

enforcement
system
which
would
provide
21


adequate

vehicle
operator
traveling
at
the
22


speed
limit
before
entering
the

23


law
enforcement
system.
24


The
bill
requires
that
recorded
images
produced
by
an
25


automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system
showing
a
violation
of
26


a
posted
speed
limit
or
an
official
traffic

of
the
local
law
enforcement
28


agency
to
affirm
that
the
violation
occurred
and
the
identity
29


of
the
motor
vehicle
involved
in
the
violation.
A
notice
of
30


a
fine
or

issued

the
owner
of
the
motor
vehicle
31


must
include
an
affidavit

on
the
fine
amounts
that
may
2


be
charged
by
a
local
authority
for
automated
traffic
law
3


enforcement
violations
and
prohibits
a
local
authority
from
4


charging

to
a
fine.
The
5


fine
for
a

of

For
a
speeding

exceed
the
amount
of
the
fine
set
out
in
Code
section
805.8A
8


for
an

violation
charged

Speeding
fines
are
also
subject
to
the
limitation
10


under
current
law,
which
restricts
penalties
for
violation
of
11


a
local
ordinance
to
not
more
than
the
penalty
for
a
simple
12


misdemeanor,
currently
capped
at
$625.
13


The
bill
requires
a
local
authority
using
an
automated
14


traffic
law
enforcement
system
to
file
an
annual
report
with
15


the
department
of
public
safety
comparing
the

rate
16


of
accidents
that
occurred
at
each
automated
traffic
law
17


enforcement
system
location
for
the
two
previous
years.
The
18


report
is
to
be
kept
on
file
by
the
local
authority
for
use
by
19


its
governing
body
in
evaluating
public
safety
improvements
20


under
the
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
program.
21


The
bill
provides
that
notices
mailed
or
citations
issued
of
22


violations
committed
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
bill,
23


pursuant
to
a
local
ordinance,
are
not
invalidated
by
the
bill
24


and
remain
enforceable.
