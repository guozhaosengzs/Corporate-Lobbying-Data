of
immediate

takes
effect
upon

EXPLANATION
12


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
13


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
14


This
bill
eliminates
requirements
and
references
to
the
15


(Iowa)
core
curriculum
and
to
core
content
standards,
but
16


continues
to
direct
the
state
board
of
education
to
adopt
high
17


school
graduation
requirements
and
assessment
standards.
18


The
bill
requires
the
state
board
to
adopt
rules
prohibiting
19


the
department
from
adopting
and
implementing
statewide
core
20


curriculum
standards.
However,
schools
are
strongly
encouraged
21


to
set
high
expectations
in
locally
developed
core
content
22


standards
and
are
also
encouraged
to
include
in
locally
23


developed
standards
21st
century
skills.
The
bill
also
directs
24


the
state
board
of
education
to
adopt
rules
prohibiting
the
25


department
of
education
from
adopting
and
implementing
the
26


next
generation
science
standards
as
developed
by
the
national
27


research
council
and
cooperating
states.
28


Provisions
directing
school
districts
to
cooperate
with
each
29


eighth
grade
student
on
a
core
curriculum
plan
to
meet
core
30


curriculum
requirements
are
amended
to
replace
“core
curriculum
31


plan”
with
“graduation
plan”
and
“core
curriculum
requirements”
32


with
“high
school
graduation
requirements”.
The
term
“core
33


content
standards”,
which
was
used
to
describe
the
assessment
34


standards
adopted
by
the
state
board,
is
replaced
with
the
term

applicable
to
all
students
in
kindergarten
through

every

and

changes
to

provisions
which
