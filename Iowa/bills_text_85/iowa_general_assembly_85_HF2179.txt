This
bill
makes
technical
corrections
to
revise
internal
10


references
and
adjusts
language
to
reflect
current
state
school
11


finance
practices,
revising
references
to
an
accrediting
12


agency,
reestablishes
a
rulemaking
provision
relating
to
the
13


beginning
teacher
mentoring
and
induction
program,
and
provides
14


for
the
disposition
and
sale
of
certain
school
district
15


property.
16


The
bill
amends
Code
sections
260C.36,
260C.47,
260C.48,
17


261.9,
and
261.92
to
replace
references
to
the
“north
central
18


association
of
colleges
and
(secondary)
schools”
with
19


references
to
the
higher
learning
commission.
The
bill
states
20


that
the
comprehensive
evaluation
conducted
on
a
community
21


college
must
occur
every
10
years,
rather
than
during
the
same
22


year
as
the
evaluation
by
the
accrediting
agency
as
the
current
23


requirement
provides.
The
bill
also
strikes
obsolete
language
24


from
these
Code
sections
as
necessary.
25


The
bill
modifies
a
provision
relating
to
core
indicators
26


of
student
achievement
to
differentiate
between
core
academic
27


indicators
and
other
core
indicators
that
include
but
are
28


not
limited
to
graduation
rate,
postsecondary
education,
29


and
successful
employment
in
Iowa.
The
bill
provides
that
30


assessments
of
core
indicators
are
to
be
administered
to
assess
31


core
academic
indicators.
32


The
bill
provides
that
school
districts
and
accredited
33


nonpublic
schools
may
consider
that
any
student
at
any
grade
34


level
who
satisfactorily
completes
a
high
school-level
unit

instruction
has
satisfactorily
completed
a
unit
of
the
high

school
graduation
requirements
for
that
area
of
instruction
2


and
the
school
district
or
school
may
issue
high
school
credit
3


for
the
unit
to
the
student.
Currently,
any
student
who
4


successfully
completes
English
or
language
arts,
mathematics,
5


science,
and
social
studies
at
the
secondary
level
may
receive
6


high
school
credit
for
such
completion.
7


The
bill
corrects
internal
references
and
modifies
state
8


school
finance
language
modified
or
enacted
by
2013
Iowa
Acts,
9


chapter
121
(HF
215).
The
internal
10


references
relate
to
provisions


establishing
the
teacher
leadership
supplement,
and
the
11


language
modifications
relate
to
changes
to
the
terms
“modified
12


allowable
growth”
and
“modified
supplemental
amount”
in
school
13


district
funding
terminology.
14


The
bill
also
reestablishes
a
provision,
inadvertently
15


stricken
in
the
2013
legislation,
requiring
the
state
board
of
16


education
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
the
beginning
teacher
17


mentoring
and
induction
program.
18


The
bill
establishes
that
a
school
district
may
deposit
19


proceeds
from
the
sale
or
disposition
of
real
or
other
property
20


into
the
fund
which
was
used
to
account
for
the
acquisition
21


of
the
property.
If
the
district
is
unable
to
determine
22


which
fund
was
used
or
if
the
fund
no
longer
exists,
the
23


proceeds
shall
be
placed
in
the
physical
plant
and
equipment
24


levy
fund.
Current
law
only
permits
that
the
proceeds
be
25


placed
in
the
physical
plant
and
equipment
levy
fund.
The
26


same
Code
provision
is
amended
to
specify
that
a
school
27


district
may
purchase
sites
for
the
erection
of
additional
28


“student-constructed”
structures,
and
the
proceeds
from
the
29


disposition
of
a
student-constructed
structure
must
be
placed
30


in
the
school
district’s
student
construction
fund.
