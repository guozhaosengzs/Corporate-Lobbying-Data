17


The

does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by

members
of
the
general

19


This
bill
includes
provisions
relating
to
child
support
20


license
sanctions
under
Code
chapter
252J.
21


Currently,
an
obligor
is
subject
to
license
sanctions
if
the
22


support
payments
required
by
a
support
order
are
not
paid
by
23


the
obligor
and
become
delinquent
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
24


support
payment
for
three
months.
The
bill
would
reduce
this
25


to
an
amount
equal
to
the
support
payment
for
two
months.
26


The
bill
also
provides
that
if
an
obligor
is
subject
to
27


license
sanctions
for
a
third
time
in
a
consecutive
five-year
28


period,
in
lieu
of
the
existing
procedure
for
license
sanctions
29


which
includes
the
opportunity
to
schedule
a
conference
with
30


the
child
support
recovery
unit
(unit)
and
to
enter
a
written
31


agreement
for
payment,
the
unit
will
instead
send
a
notice
to
32


the
obligor
that
the
obligor
is
subject
to
license
sanctions,
33


and
that
the
only
opportunity
to
challenge
the
unit’s
actions
34


is
by
requesting
a
district
court
hearing.

actions
of

H.F.

the
licensing
authority
are
not
stayed
upon
filing
of
the
1


application
for
a
hearing.
The
scope
of
review
by
the
district
2


court
is
limited
to
demonstration
of
a
mistake
of
fact
relating
3


to
the
delinquency
of
the
obligor.
If
the
court
finds
that
the
4


unit
was
in
error,
the
unit
is
required
to
issue
a
withdrawal
5


of
a
certificate
of
noncompliance
to
the
appropriate
licensing
6


authority.
If
the
obligor
is
subject
to
revocation
or
7


suspension
of
a
license
or
is
denied
the
issuance
or
renewal
of
8


a
license,
the
unit
may
issue
a
withdrawal
of
the
certificate
9


of
noncompliance
to
the
appropriate
licensing
authority
only
10


upon
payment
by
the
obligor
of
the
total
amount
of
delinquent
11


support
owed.
12


The
bill
also
provides
that
subsequent
to
a
license
sanction
13


that
is
based
on
the
obligor
being
subject
to
a
third
license
14


sanction
in
a
consecutive
five-year
period,
if
an
obligor
15


fails
to
comply
with
a
support
order
and
becomes
delinquent
16


in
an
amount
equal
to
the
support
payment
for
two
months,
17


the
unit
shall
issue
a
notice
to
the
obligor
that
the
unit
18


is
automatically
issuing
a
certificate
of
noncompliance
to
19


any
appropriate
licensing
authority
identified
in
the
notice
20


for
revocation
or
denial
of
the
issuance
or
renewal
of
any
21


appropriate
license.
The
notice
is
to
inform
the
obligor
that
22


no
opportunity,
including
the
opportunity
for
judicial
review,
23


exists
to
challenge
the
actions
initiated
by
the
unit.
