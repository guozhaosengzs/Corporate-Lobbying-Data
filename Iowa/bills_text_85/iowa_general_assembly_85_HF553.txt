EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
relates
to
medical
assistance
(Medicaid)
program
14


integrity.
15


The
bill
amends
Code
section
10A.108,
which
provides
that
16


if
a
person
refuses
or
neglects
to
repay
benefits
or
provider
17


payments
inappropriately
obtained
from
the
department
of
human
18


services
(DHS),
the
amount
inappropriately
obtained
constitutes
19


a
debt
and
is
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
state
upon
all
property
20


belonging
to
the
person.
The
bill
provides
that
DHS
is
no
21


longer
responsible
for
paying
the
fee
for
recording
of
the
22


satisfaction
of
the
lien
or
the
debt,
but
that
this
is
the
23


responsibility
of
the
debtor.
24


The
bill
requires
a
provider
who
has
received
an
overpayment
25


to
provide
notification
in
writing
and
return
the
overpayment
26


to
the
department,
department’s
agent,
or
the
department’s
27


contractor,
as
applicable.
The
notification
and
return
of
the
28


overpayment
are
to
be
completed
the
later
of
60
days
after
the
29


date
on
which
the
overpayment
was
identified
by
the
provider
or
30


the
date
any
corresponding
cost
report
is
due,
as
applicable.
31


Violation
of
this
provision
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
32


false
claims
Act
(Code
chapter
685).
33


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
provider
is
administratively
and
34


involuntarily
dissolved
and
receives
payments
following
the
35


-13-

H.F.

dissolution,
the
payments
are
considered
to
be
overpayments
and
1


to
be
incorrectly
paid.
2


The
bill
provides
for
the
accrual
of
interest
on,
and
the
3


rate
of
interest
applicable
to,
overpayments.
4


The
bill
requires
that
an
administrative

The

8


provider
types
identified
by
the
centers
for
Medicare
and
9


Medicaid
services
of
the
United
States
department
of
health
10


and
human
services
(CMS)
as
posing
an
increased
risk
to
the
11


Medicaid
program.
The
moratoria
are
not
required
if

of
a

moratorium
would
13


adversely
affect

services.

to
16


impose
temporary
moratoria
on
enrollment
of
new
providers,
or
17


impose
numerical
caps
or
other
limits
that
the
IME
and
CMS
18


identify
as
having
a
significant
potential
for
fraud,
waste,
19


or
abuse.
Before
implementing
the
moratoria,
caps,
or
other
20


limits,
IME
must
determine
that
its
action
would
not
adversely
21


impact
access
by
recipients
to
Medicaid
services,
notify
CMS
22


in
writing,
and
receive
approval
from
CMS.
Any
moratorium
is
23


to
be
imposed
for
an
initial
period
of
six
months
and
may
then
24


be
extended
in
six-month
increments.
The
necessity
for
any
25


extension
is
to
be
documented
in
writing.
26


The
bill
requires
the
director
of
human
services

that
the

department
has

an
identified

a
false
claims
32


law

to
Medicaid.
