of
public
health.
The
abuse
education
review
panel
was
1


established
to
review

training
2


curricula.
The
bill
instead
transfers
this
responsibility
3


to
the
department
of
public

and
also
requires
the
4

11


months
after
initial
employment
or
self-employment,
a
mandatory
12


reporter
must

a

interactive
training.
The
13


bill
requires
the
department
of
public
health
to
approve
the
14


trainers
for
this
interactive
training.
The
other
training
15


requirements
for
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
remain
the
16


same
under
the
bill.
17


The
bill
increases
the
number
of
hours
of
training
for
18


persons
required
to
report
both
child
abuse
and
dependent
adult
19


abuse
who
are
completing
a
combined
training
from
two
hours

20


three
hours.
21


The
bill
states
that
the
interactive
training
requirement
22


applies
to
mandatory
reporters
of
child
abuse
who
begin
initial
23


employment
or
self-employment
on
or
after
July
1,
2013.
The
24


bill
also
provides
that
the
provision
increasing
the
training
25


requirement
for
combined
child
abuse
and
dependent
adult
abuse
26


training
applies
on
and
after
July
1,
2014,
to
those
mandatory
27


reporters
of
both
child
abuse
and
dependent
adult
abuse
who
are
28
