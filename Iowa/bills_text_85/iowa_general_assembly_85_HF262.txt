An

the

is
created
to
be
headed
and
administered
by
a
9


chief

of
10


the
office
by
the

for
a
term
of
six

subject

by

The

or
any
other
provision
18


of
law,
to
use
an
administrative

An
administrative

employed

20


shall
not
perform
duties
inconsistent
with
the
judge’s
duties
21


and
responsibilities
as
an
administrative
law
judge
and
shall
22


be
located
in
an
office

its
administrative

judges
so
that

charge
the

office’s
administrative
law
judges
to
acquire
4


or
maintain
the

If
the
office
cannot
furnish
one

its
administrative

to
an
agency
request,
the
administrator
7

of
an
agency
8


other

the

agency
to
serve
as
administrative
9


law
judge
for
the
proceeding,
but
only
with
the
consent
of
10

7.
The
office
shall
adopt
rules
pursuant
to
this
chapter
and
21


chapter
17A
to
do
all
of
the
following:
22


a.
To
establish
procedures
for
agencies
to

the
administrator
to
assign

judges
employed

25


b.
To

with
chapter
17A
and
other
provisions
of
law,
to
govern
27


administrative
law
judges
employed
by
the
office,
but
any
28


rules
adopted
under
this
paragraph
shall
be
applicable
to
a
29


particular
contested
case
proceeding
only
to
the
extent
that
30


they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
rules
of
the
agency
under
31


whose
authority
that
proceeding
is
conducted.
Nothing
in
this
32


paragraph
precludes
an
agency
from
establishing
procedural
33


requirements
otherwise
within
its
authority
to
govern
its
34


contested
case
proceedings,
including
requirements

respect
to
the
timeliness
of
decisions
rendered
for
it
by
1


administrative
law
judges.
2


c.
To
establish
standards
and
procedures
for
the
evaluation,
3


training,
promotion,
and
discipline
for
the
administrative
law
4


judges
employed
by
the
office.
The
procedures
shall
include
5


provisions
for
each
agency
for
whom
a
particular
administrative
6


law
judge
presides
to
submit
to
the
office
on
a
periodic
basis
7


the
agency’s
views
with
respect
to
the
performance
of
that
8


administrative
law
judge
or
the
need
for
specified
additional
9


training
for
that
administrative
law
judge.
However,
the
10


evaluation,
training,
promotion,
and
discipline
of
all
11


administrative
law
judges
employed
by
the
office
shall
remain
12


solely
within
the
authority
of
the
office.
13


d.
To
establish,
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
14


section
and
chapter
17A,
a
code
of
administrative
judicial
15


conduct
that
is
similar
in
function
and
substantially
16


equivalent
to
the
Iowa
code
of
judicial
conduct,
to
govern
17


the
conduct,
in
relation
to
their
quasi-judicial
functions
in
18


contested
cases,
of
all
persons
who
act
as
presiding
officers
19


under
the
authority
of
section
17A.11,
subsection
1.
The
code
20


of
administrative
judicial
conduct
shall
separately
specify
21


which
provisions
are
applicable
to
agency
heads
or
members
of
22


multimembered
agency
heads
when
they
act
as
presiding
officers,
23


taking
into
account
the
objectives
of
the
code
and
the
fact
24


that
agency
heads,
unlike
administrative
law
judges,
have
other
25


duties
imposed
upon
them
by
law.
The
code
of
administrative
26


judicial
conduct
may
also
contain
separate
provisions,
which
27


are
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
such
a
28


code,
to
govern
the
conduct
of
agency
heads
or
the
members
of
29


multimember
agency
heads
when
they
act
as
presiding
officers.
30


However,
a
provision
of
the
code
of
administrative
judicial
31


conduct
shall
not
be
made
applicable
to
agency
heads
or
members
32


of
multimember
agency
heads
unless
the
application
of
that
33


provision
to
agency
heads
and
members
of
multimember
agency
34


heads
has
previously
been
approved
by
the
administrative
rules
