The

provides
that
the
purpose

is
13


to

the
public
health,
safety,
and
welfare
by

The
bill
provides
for

licenses.
A
license
may
be
denied,
suspended,

19


the
department
finds
there
has
been
a
substantial
failure
to
20


comply
with
the
Code
chapter
or
the
rules
and
standards
adopted
21


under

authorizes
the
department,
after

and
a
reasonable
time
for
26


corrective
action,
and
if
the
noncompliance
does
not
endanger
27


public
health
or
safety,
to
issue
a
conditional
license
to
the
28


ambulatory

revoking
its
license.
30


The
bill
also
authorizes
the
department
to
issue
an
31


emergency
order
to
suspend
a

if
the
department
has
32


reasonable

creates
an
