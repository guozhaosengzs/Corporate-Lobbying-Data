EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
provides
for
the
regulation
of
the
use
of
automated
20


traffic
enforcement
systems
on
primary
roads.
21


The
bill
defines
“automated
enforcement”
as
the
use
of
22


automated
traffic
enforcement
systems
for
enforcement
of
laws
23


regulating
vehicular
traffic.
“Automated
traffic
enforcement
24


system”
is
defined
as
a
system
that
operates
in
conjunction
25


with
an
official
traffic-control
signal
or
speed-measuring
26


device
to
photographically
record
a
vehicle
being
driven
into
27


an
intersection
in
violation
of
the
official
traffic-control
28


signal
or
being
driven
at
a
prohibited
rate
of
speed,
and
is
29


designed
to
obtain
a
photograph
of
the
vehicle’s
license
plate.
30


The
bill
prohibits
local
authorities
from
locating
or
31


operating
mobile
automated
traffic
enforcement
systems

2013.
33


The

requires
a
local

for
automated
5


enforcement
at
the
proposed
location.
The
bill
specifies
6


that
permits
will
only
be
issued
for
high-crash
or
high-risk
7


locations,
as
defined
in
the
bill.
In
addition,
a
qualifying
8


location
must
be
an
area
where
conventional
enforcement
is
9


unsafe,
ineffective,
or
unable
to
address
traffic
safety
10


needs;
an
area
with
a
significant
history
of
accidents
11


attributable

violations
or
speeding;
12


an
intersection
with
a
significant
history
of
traffic-control
13


signal
violations;
a

where
operational
issues
create
significant

15


and
automated
enforcement
can
help
manage
a
more
orderly
flow
16


of
traffic.
17


A
justification
report
must
also
contain
documentation
of
18


existing
traffic
speeds
and
traffic
volume,
posted
speed
limits
19


and

is
satisfied
that
appropriate
27


engineering

The
bill
requires
a
local

with
the
current
manual
on
uniform
15


traffic
control
devices
adopted
by
the

to
annually
evaluate
17


the
effectiveness
of
automated

department
may
require
the
removal
or
modification
of
an
