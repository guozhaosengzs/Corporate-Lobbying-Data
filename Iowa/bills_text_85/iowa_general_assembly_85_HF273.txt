EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
establishes
standards
and
requirements
for
the
11


construction
and
maintenance
of
walkways
in
rail
yards.
The
12


provisions
of
the
bill
apply
to
all
walkways
in
rail
yards
in
13


this
state,
but
do
not
apply
to
tracks
in
industry
yards
owned
14


by
an
entity
other
than
a
rail
carrier.
15


The
bill
specifies
that
walkways
may
be
surfaced
with
16


asphalt,
concrete,
planking,
grating,
native
material,
crushed
17


material,
or
other
similar
material.
If
crushed
material
is
18


used,
100
percent
of
the
material
must
be
able
to
pass
through
19


a
one
and
one-half
inch
sieve
opening,
and
at
least
90
percent
20


of
the
material
must
be
able
to
pass
through
a
one-inch
sieve
21


opening,
with
allowance
for
a
de
minimus
variation.
The
22


bill
contains
general
recommendations
for
the
use
of
crushed
23


material.
In
addition,
the
bill
requires
that
walkways
be
24


at
least
two
feet
wide,
with
cross
slopes
of
not
more
than
25


one
inch
of
elevation
for
each
eight
inches
of
length
in
any
26


direction.
Walkways
must
have
a
reasonably
uniform
surface,
27


be
maintained
in
safe
condition
without
compromising
track
28


drainage,
and
be
kept
reasonably
free
of
spilled
fuel
oil,
29


sand,
posts,
vegetation,
nonballast
rocks,
and
other
hazards
30


and
obstructions.
31


The
bill
establishes
a
standard
requirement
for
rail
32


carriers
to
provide
walkways
adjacent
to
portions
of
yard
33


tracks
where
rail
carrier
employees
work
on
the
ground
34


performing
switching
activities
at
least
five
days
per
week,

one
shift
per
day.
However,
following
an
administrative
1


hearing,
the
department
of
transportation
may
order
a
rail
2


carrier
to
construct
a
walkway
or
conform
a
preexisting
walkway
3


to
the
new
standards
along
any
portion
of
track
where
the
lack
4


of
a
walkway
or
condition
of
a
walkway
poses
a
safety
hazard
5


to
employees
performing
switching
activities
for
any
period
of
6


time.
7


The
bill
excuses
a
rail
carrier
from
compliance
with
walkway
8


requirements
during
maintenance
activities
and
during
periods
9


of
heavy
rain
or
snow,
derailment,
rock
and
earth
slides,
10


washouts,
or
other
weather
or
seismic
conditions,
and
for
a
11


reasonable
period
following
such
an
occurrence.
12


The
department
of
transportation
may
grant
a
waiver
of
any
13


provision
of
the
bill
to
a
rail
carrier
upon
a
showing
of
good
14


cause,
including
but
not
limited
to
a
showing
that
compliance
15


will
impose
an
undue
hardship
on
the
rail
carrier.
16


A
person
who
alleges
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
17


bill

does
not
respond
22


within
30
days,
or
does
not
resolve
the
alleged
violation
23


within
90
days,
the

may
file
a

with
24


the

Within

30
days
in

which
to
respond,
either
by
correcting
the
alleged
violation
28


or
by
contesting
the
complaint.
If
the
rail
carrier
contests
29


the
complaint,
the
department
is
required
to
inspect
the
area
30


of
the
alleged
violation
and,
upon
a
finding
that
a
violation
31


exists,
order
the
rail
carrier
to
correct
the
violation
within
32


30
days
of
receipt
of
the
order.
If,
following
the
inspection,
33


the
department
finds
that

exists,
it
must
notify
34


the
person
who

may
