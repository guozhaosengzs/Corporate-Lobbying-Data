EXPLANATION
20


This
bill
relates
to
the
review
of
administrative
rules
and
21


the
rulemaking
process.
22


CITIZENS’
ADVISORY
COMMITTEE.
The
bill
requires
that
the
23


administrative
rules
coordinator
create
a
citizens’
committee,
24


to
advise
the
administrative
rules
coordinator
on
rulemaking
25


issues.
The
members
of
the
committee
shall
not
be
paid
a
per
26


diem
but
shall
be
reimbursed
for
travel
expenses.
27


RULEMAKING
HEARINGS
THROUGHOUT
STATE.
The
bill
requires
28


administrative
agencies,
when
feasible,
to
hold
rulemaking
29


hearings
in
varied
locations
throughout
the
state
via
the
Iowa
30


communications
network
or
other
electronic
means
and
provides
31


that
a
hearing
must

34


PRINCIPAL
REASONS
FOR
AND
AGAINST
RULE.
The
bill
requires
35


-9-


LSB
1884XS
(4)
85


jr/rj

12



S.F.
138


that
every
adopted
rule
must
be
accompanied
by
a
concise
1


statement
of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
against
the
rule
2


adopted.
Under
current
law
such
a
statement
is
only
provided
3


on
request.
4


JOBS
IMPACT
STATEMENTS.
The
bill
requires
that
every
5


proposed
rule
under
a
notice
of
intended
action
or
publication
6


without
notice
contain
a
jobs
impact
statement
which
outlines
7


the
objective
and
statutory
authority
of
the
rule
and
analyzes
8


and
sets
out
in
detail
the
impact
of
the
proposed
rule
on
state
9


agencies,
local
governments,
the
public,
and
the
regulated
10


entities,
including
regulated
businesses
and
self-employed
11


individuals
affected
by
the
rule.
The
statement
must
also
12


determine
whether
a
proposed
rule
would
have
a
positive
13


or
negative
impact
on
private
sector
jobs
and
employment
14


opportunities.
15


Commencing
July
1,
2014,
and
every
five
years
thereafter,
16


each
agency
shall
prepare
a
jobs
impact
statement
for
all
of
17


the
agency’s
rules.
The
statement
will
be
published
in
the
18


Iowa
administrative
bulletin.
19


As
part
of
this
requirement,
an
agency
is
required
to
20


takes
steps
to
minimize
the
adverse
impact
on
jobs
and
the
21


development
of
new
employment
opportunities
before
proposing
22


a
rule.
23


The
administrative
rules
coordinator
may
waive
the
jobs
24


impact
statement
requirement
for
emergency-filed
rules
or
if
25


unnecessary
or
impractical.
26


NEGOTIATED
RULEMAKING
GROUPS.
If
required
by
statute,
27


this
bill
requires
an
agency
to
create
an
ad
hoc
negotiated
28


rulemaking
group
to
review
draft
rule
proposals
prior
to
29


commencing
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
Where
a
statute
does
30


not
require
this
review,
the
bill
allows
an
agency
to
create
31


such
a
review
group.
Members
are
appointed
by
the
agency
32


and
the
composition
must
adequately
represent
a
fair
balance
33


of
the
interests
affected
by
the
rule.
Once
such
a
group
is
34


created,
the
agency
may
only
commence
rulemaking
after
the
35


-10-


LSB
1884XS

85


jr/rj


10/
12



S.F.
138


group
has
considered
the
draft
rule
proposal
in
question.
This
1


provision
is
based
on
similar
provisions
found
in
the
federal
2


Administrative
Procedures
Act.
3


USER-FRIENDLY
INTERNET
SITES.
The
bill
requires
each
4


agency
to
make
available
to
the
public
a
uniform,
searchable,
5


and
user-friendly
rules
database,
published
on
an
internet
6


site,
subject
to
the
direction
of
the
administrative
rules
7


coordinator.
Each
agency’s
internet
site
must
contain
8


specified
information
relating
to
the
agency’s
rules
and
9


available
procedures
for
public
participation.
10


FIVE-YEAR
CYCLE
OF
AGENCY
REVIEW
OF
RULES.
Current
11


law
requires
that
each
state
agency
review
all
of
its
12


administrative
rules
on
a
five-year
cycle.
The
plan
for
this
13


review
must
be
developed
in
consultation
with
stakeholders
14


and
constituent
groups.
The
goal
of
the
review
is
the
15


identification
and
elimination
of
all
rules
of
the
agency
that
16


are
outdated,
redundant,
overbroad,
ineffective,
unnecessary,
17


or
otherwise
undesirable.
18


The
bill
requires
that
each
agency
develop
a
plan
for
19


conducting
the
five-year
review,
which
includes
detailing
the
20


methodology
for
conducting
the
review
and
a
means
for
public
21


participation.
22


NARROW
CONSTRUCTION
OF
RULES.
The
bill
also
establishes
23


a
new
rule
of
statutory
construction:
Unless
otherwise
24


specifically
provided
in
statute,
any
grant
of
rulemaking
25


authority
shall
be
construed
narrowly.
26


FEDERAL
LAW
IMPLEMENTATION.
The
bill
also
provides
that
27


state
implementation
of
a
federal
statute,
regulation,
28


or
policy
by
a
state
agency
shall
not
exceed
the
specific
29


requirements
of
the
federal
statute,
regulation,
or
30


policy,
except
as
specifically
allowed
by
state
law.
Any
31


portion
of
a
state
rule
or
policy
that
implements
a
federal
32


statute,
regulation,
or
policy
and
that
exceeds
the
specific
33


requirements
of
the
federal
statute,
regulation,
or
policy
is
34


automatically
superseded
by
the
specific
requirements
of
that
