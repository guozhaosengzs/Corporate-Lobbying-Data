EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
withdrawal
of
a
specimen
of
blood
or
4


urine
for
chemical
testing
pursuant
or
a
search
warrant
issued
5


in
an
operating-while-intoxicated
case.
6


Under
current
law,
refusal
to
consent
to
a
test
under
7


Code
section
321J.6
(implied
consent)
does
not
prohibit
the
8


withdrawal
of
a
specimen
of
blood
for
chemical
testing
pursuant
9


to
a
search
warrant
issued
in
the
investigation
of
a
suspected
10


involuntary
manslaughter
(Code
section
707.5)
or
homicide
or
11


serious
injury
by
vehicle
(Code
section
707.6A)
if
a
traffic
12


accident
has
resulted
in
a
death
or
personal
injury
reasonably
13


likely
to
cause
death
and
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
14


believe
that
one
or
more
of
the
persons
whose
driving
may
have
15


been
the
proximate
cause
of
the
accident
were
violating
Code
16


section
321J.2
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
A
urine
sample
17


may
be
collected
in
lieu
of
a
blood
sample
under
certain
18


circumstances.
19


The
bill
provides
that
all
second
and
subsequent
Code
20


chapter
321J
offenders
can
be
forced
to
submit
to
blood
or
21


urine
testing
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
and
eliminates
the
22


requirement
that
there
must
be
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
23


the
person
was
violating
Code
section
321J.2
and
an
accident
24


occurred
resulting
in
death
or
personal
injury
reasonably
25


likely
to
cause
death,
in
addition
to
cases
involving
26


involuntary
manslaughter
or
homicide
or
serious
injury
by
27


vehicle.
An
officer
may
take
a
urine
sample
in
lieu
of
or
in
28


addition
to
a
blood
sample
if
the
person
is
capable
of
giving
a
29


urine
sample
and
the
sample
can
be
collected
without
the
need
30


to
physically
withdraw
the
sample.
If
the
person
from
whom
a
31


specimen
of
urine
is
to
be
collected
objects
to
the
withdrawal,
32


the
person
may
voluntarily
provide
a
urine
sample
if
the
person
33


is
capable
of
giving
a
urine
sample
and
the
sample
can
be
34


collected
without
the
need
to
physically
withdraw
the
sample.
