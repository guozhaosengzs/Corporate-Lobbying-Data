BACKGROUND.
This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
162,
which
20


provides
for
the
regulation
of
persons
who
possess
or
control
21


animals,
and
especially
dogs
and
cats.
The
Code
chapter
is
22


administered
and
enforced
by
the
department
of
agriculture
23


and
land
stewardship.
A
person
operating
a
commercial
24


establishment
(a
commercial
breeder,
dealer,
or
public
auction)
25


must
obtain
an
authorization
issued
by
the
department.
The
26


authorization
may
be
either
a
state
license,
or
a
permit
if
27


the
person
is
operating
under
a
federal
license
(Code
section
28


162.2A).
The
department
issues
a
certificate
of
registration
29


to
a
person
operating
a
pound,
animal
shelter,
or
research
30


facility.
31


A
commercial
breeder
is
a
person
engaged
in
the
business
32


of
breeding
dogs
or
cats,
and
who
sells,
exchanges,
or
leases
33


dogs
or
cats
in
return
for
consideration.
A
dealer
is
a
34


person
who
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
buying
for
resale
or

selling
or
exchanging
dogs
or
cats.
A
public
auction
is
a
1


place
where
dogs
or
cats
are
sold
at
auction
to
the
highest
2


bidder.
Generally,
the
person
must
pay
the
department
an
3


annual
fee
of
$175
for
being
issued
or
renewed
a
license
or
4


permit,
and
the
moneys
collected
from
these
fees
are
deposited
5


into
a
commercial
establishment
fund
for
use
by
the
department
6


in
administering
and
enforcing
the
regulations
(Code
section
7


162.2C).
However,
a
commercial
breeder
who
keeps
greyhounds
8


for
racing
is
subject
to
a
separate
fee.

BILL
——
EXEMPTION
FROM
FEE
FOR
EXHIBITORS
LICENSED
OR
10


REGISTERED
UNDER
FEDERAL
LAW.
This
bill
provides
that
a
fee
11


shall
not
be
imposed
upon
a
person
who
operates
on
a
nonprofit
12


basis
as
an
exhibitor,
if
the
person
is
licensed
or
registered
13


with
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
under
the
14


federal
Animal
Welfare
Act.
An
exhibitor
is
a
private
or
15


public
person
who
displays
an
animal
to
the
public
and
includes
16


zoos
operated
for
profit
or
not
for
profit
(7
U.S.C.
ch.
54).
17


Generally,
federal
law
requires
a
license,
but
it
also
provides
18


for
registration
in
lieu
of
licensure.
The
bill
excuses
a
19


person
who
is
either
licensed
or
registered
under
federal
law
20


as
an
exhibitor.
