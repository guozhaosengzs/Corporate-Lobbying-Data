that
4


is
subject
to
a
family

as
5


provided

liability
and
interest
as
7


provided
in

The

does
not
apply

8


real

if
the

EXPLANATION
22


BACKGROUND
——
INHERITANCE
TAX.
Code
chapter
450
imposes
an
23


inheritance
tax
on
real
estate
and
tangible
personal
property
24


located
in
this
state.
25


BACKGROUND
——
CONSANGUINITY
AND
AFFINITY.
Generally,
an
26


inheritance
tax
is
assessed
differently
upon
family
members
27


of
the
decedent.
An
individual’s
familial
relationship
is
28


classified
according
to
an
assigned
number
(degree)
that
29


separates
the
individual
from
an
ancestor
(consanguinity)
or
30


from
a
spouse’s
ancestor
(affinity).
In
either
case,
the
31


relationship
is
measured
lineally
where
one
person
is
ascending
32


from
an
ancestor
(father,
grandfather,
great-grandfather,
and
33


so
on)
or
descending
from
that
ancestor
(child,
grandchild,
34


great-grandchild,
and
so
on).
Alternatively,
the
relationship
35


-5-


LSB
1880HV
(1)
85


da/sc
5/
7








H.F.
511


may
be
measured
collaterally
where
two
individuals
share
a
1


common
ancestor
but
not
by
linear
ascent
or
descent
(e.g.,
a
2


brother,
sister,
uncle,
or
cousin).
3


For
consanguinity,
the
first
degree
includes
a
parent
or
4


child;
the
second
degree
includes
a
grandparent,
sibling,
or
5


grandchild;
the
third
degree
includes
a
great-grandparent,
6


aunt
or
uncle,
niece
or
nephew,
or
great-grandchild;
and
7


the
fourth
degree
includes
a
great-niece
or
great-nephew,
8


great-aunt
or
great-uncle,
or
first
cousin.
For
affinity,
9


family
relationships
are
measured
on
the
spouse’s
side
in
the
10


same
manner.
11


CURRENT
INHERITANCE
TAX
——
RATES.
The
amount
of
inheritance
12


tax
assessed
on
property
in
Iowa
depends
upon
the
status
of
13


the
inheriting
person
and,
if
the
person
is
an
individual,
the
14


amount
of
that
individual’s
inheritance
share.
For
example,
15


for
property
passing
to
a
second
degree
family
member
(brother
16


or
sister,
or
son-in-law
or
daughter-in-law)
the
bottom
rate
17


is
5
percent
on
an
amount
up
to
$12,500
and
the
top
rate
is
18


10
percent
on
an
amount
in
excess
of
$150,000.
For
all
other
19


individuals,
the
bottom
rate
is
10
percent
on
an
amount
up
to
20


$50,000
and
the
top
rate
is
15
percent
on
an
amount
in
excess
of
21


$100,000.
A
for-profit
corporation
is
assessed
a
single
rate
22


of
15
percent.
23


CURRENT
INHERITANCE
TAX
——
EXEMPTIONS
FOR
INDIVIDUALS.
24


Currently,
an
individual
is
exempt
from
inheritance
tax
if
the
25


individual
is
related
to
the
decedent
as
a
spouse
or
stepchild;
26


as
a
lineal
ascendant
beginning
with
a
parent
(first
degree),
27


and
then
grandparent
(second
degree),
great-grandparent
(third
28


degree),
great-great-grandparent
(fourth
degree)
and
so
on;
or
29


as
a
lineal
descendant
beginning
with
child
(first
degree),
30


and
then
grandchild
(second
degree),
great-grandchild
(third
31


degree),
great-great-grandchild
(fourth
degree),
and
so
on.
