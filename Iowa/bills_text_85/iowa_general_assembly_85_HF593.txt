policy.
The
state
of
Iowa
is
5


committed
to
providing
all
students
with
a
safe
and
civil
6


school
environment
in
which
all
members
of
the
school
community
7


are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.
The
general
assembly
8


finds
that
a
safe
and
civil
school
environment
is
necessary
9


for
students
to
learn
and
achieve

high
academic
levels.
10


Harassing

bullying
behavior
can
seriously
disrupt
the
11


ability
of
school
employees
to
maintain
a
safe
and
civil
12


environment,
and
the
ability
of
students
to
learn
and
succeed.
13


Therefore,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
Iowa
that
school
14


employees,
volunteers,
and
students
in
Iowa
schools
shall
not
15


engage
in
harassing

bullying
behavior.

are
defined
30


as
any

toward
a
student
which
is
based
on
any
actual
or

trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student
and
which

defines
“harassment”
as
any
electronic,
written,
verbal,
or
1


physical
act
or
conduct
toward
a
student
which
is
based
on
any
2


actual
or
perceived
trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student
and
3


which
creates
an
objectively
hostile
school
environment
that
4


meets
certain
conditions.
The
bill
defines
“bullying”
as
any
5


electronic,
written,
verbal,
or
physical
act
or
conduct
toward
6


a
student
which
is
based
on
any
reason
other
than
any
actual
7


or
perceived
trait
or
characteristic
of
the
student
and
which
8


creates
an
objectively
hostile
school
environment
that
meets
9


certain
conditions.
10


Under
current
law,
“trait
or
characteristic
of
the

not
be
limited

or
16


familial
status.
The
bill
applies
the
definition
to
any
other
17


distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
student.
The
bill
provides
18


that
the
definition
is
not
exhaustive
and
must
be
construed
19


broadly
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
bill.
20


The
bill
adds
social
networking
internet
sites
and
any
other
21


form
of
communication
using
electronic
means
to
the
definition
22


of
“electronic”.
23


Under
current
law,
school
antiharassment
and
antibullying
24


policies
must
prohibit
harassment
and
bullying
in
school,
on
25


school
property,
and
at
any
school
function
or
school-sponsored
26


activity.
The
bill
adds
presence
in
any
vehicle
owned,
27


leased,
provided,
or
hired
by

the
use
of
28


any
property
or
equipment
owned,

by
the
29


school;
while
attending
or
engaged
in
school
activities;
and
30


in
any
other
location
or
circumstance
if
the
act
or
conduct
at
31


issue
directly
affects
the
good
order,
efficient
management,
32


and
welfare
of
the
school
to
this
list.
33


The
bill
requires
school
antiharassment
and
antibullying
34


policies
to
prohibit
reprisal,
retaliation,
or

accusation
