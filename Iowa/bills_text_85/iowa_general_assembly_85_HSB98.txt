EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
relates
to
property
taxes
of
veterans
and
members
11


of
the
armed
forces.
12


The
disabled
veterans
tax
credit
under
Code
section
425.15
13


provides
a
credit
on
the
homestead
of
an
eligible
veteran
14


who
acquired
the
homestead
under
specified
federal
programs
15


in
an
amount
equal
to
the
entire
amount
of
the
tax
levied
on
16


the
homestead.
This
bill
modifies
the
qualifications
for
the
17


disabled
veterans
tax
credit
by
adding
to
the
list
of
veterans
18


who
are
eligible
for
the
credit,
the
following:
(1)
a
veteran
19


as
defined
in
Code
section
35.1
with
a
permanent
and
total
20


service-connected
disability
as
certified
by
the
United
States
21


department
of
veterans
affairs;
and
(2)
a
former
member
of
the
22


national
guard
of
any
state
who
otherwise
meets
the
service
23


requirements
for
Iowa
national
guard
members
under
Code
section
24


35.1(2)(b),
subparagraph
(2)
or

with
a
permanent
and
total
25


service-connected
disability
as
certified
by
the
United
States
26


department
of
veterans
affairs.
The
bill
also
strikes
the
27


income
limitation
qualifications
for
the
disabled
veteran
tax
28


credit.
29


The
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
425.15A,
which
provides
30


that
the
property
tax
on
a
disabled
veteran’s
homestead
shall
31


not
increase
from
year
to

To
receive
this
credit,
the
32


veteran
must
file
on
or
before
June
30
in
a
manner
similar
33


to

credit.
Once
the
claim
34


is
filed
and
allowed,
the
veteran
does
not
have
to
file
for
