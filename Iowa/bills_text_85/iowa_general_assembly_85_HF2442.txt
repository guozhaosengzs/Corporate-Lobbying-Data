EXPLANATION
8


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
9


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
10


Under
current
law,
the
department
of
transportation
may
11


suspend
a
person’s
driver’s
license
upon
a
showing
that
the
12


person
is
a
habitual
violator
of
the
traffic
laws.
Pursuant
13


to
administrative
rules,
a
“habitual
violator”
is
a
person
who
14


has
been
convicted
of
three
or
more
moving
violations
committed
15


within
a
12-month
period.
The
accumulation
of
convictions
16


for
moving
violations
may
also
lead
to
license
revocation
if
17


the
person
is
determined
to
be
a
habitual
offender.
“Moving
18


violation”
is
defined
in
administrative
rules
as
any
violation
19


of
motor
vehicle
laws,
with
certain
exceptions
including
a
20


violation
of
Code
section
321.20B
for
failure
to
provide
21


proof
of

liability
coverage.
This
bill
directs
the
22


department
of
transportation
to
amend
its
rules
by
removing
23


that
exception.
24


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
