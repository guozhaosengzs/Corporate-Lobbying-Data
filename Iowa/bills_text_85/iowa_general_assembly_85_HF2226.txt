a.
Adopt,
by

implement

,

459A
,
and
459B
relating
to
permits
,

The
commission
may
also
adopt,
by
rule,
a
6


schedule
of
fees
for
permit

conditional
permit
applications
7


and
a
schedule
of
fees
which
may
be
periodically
assessed
8


for
administration
of
permits
and
conditional
permits
.
In
9


determining
the
fee
schedules,
the
commission
shall
consider:

(1)
The
state’s
reasonable
cost
of
reviewing
applications,
11


issuing

conditional
permits
,
and
checking
12


compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
permits.

relative
benefits
to
the
applicant
and
to
the
14


public
of
permit
and
conditional
permit
review,
issuance,
and
15


monitoring
compliance.
It
is
the
intention
of
the
legislature
16


that
permit
fees
shall
not
cover
any
costs
connected
with
17


correcting
violation
of
the
terms
of
any
permit
and
shall
not
18


impose
unreasonable
costs
on
any
municipality.
19


(3)
The
typical
costs
of
the
particular
types
of
projects
20


or
activities
for
which
permits
or
conditional
permits


are
21


required,
provided
that
in
no
circumstances
shall
fees
be
in
22


excess
of
the
actual
costs
to
the
department.
