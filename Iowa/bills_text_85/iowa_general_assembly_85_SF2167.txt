EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this

does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


This
bill
makes
changes
to
employment
background
checks,
5


disciplinary
procedures,
and
procedures
for
contesting
6


regulatory
insufficiencies
for
certain
entities
regulated
by
7


the
department
of
inspections
and
appeals
(DIA).
8


The
bill
changes
the
crimes
for
which
a
hospital
can
9


temporarily
employ
a
person
who
committed
the
crime
pending
10


completion
of
a
department
of
human
services
evaluation
11


to
determine
whether
the
crime
warrants
prohibition
of
12


employment
at
the
hospital
or
health
care
facility.
The
bill
13


disallows
such
continued
employment
for
simple
misdemeanors
14


under
the
motor
vehicles
and
law
of
the
road
chapter.
The
15


bill
eliminates
duplicative
language
regarding
crimes
for
16


which
a
health
care
facility
can
temporarily
employ
a
person
17


who
committed
a
crime
and
crimes
for
which
a
student
can
18


temporarily
continue
with
a
clinical
education
component.
19


The
bill
also
provides
that
if
a
hospital
or
health
care
20


facility
subject
to
background
checks
for
employees
is
informed
21


after
the
applicant
or
employee’s
application
date
that
the
22


applicant
or
employee
is
convicted
of
a
crime
or
has
a
record
23


of
founded
child
or
dependent
adult
abuse
entered
in
the
abuse
24


registry,
the
hospital
or
health
care
facility
shall
act
25


within
seven
calendar
days
rather
than
48
hours
to
verify
that
26


information.
The
bill
also
amends
the
equivalent
verification
27


time
period
for
students
in
a
certified
nurse
aide
training
28


program
from
48
hours
to
seven
days.
29


The
bill
provides
that
the
DIA
has
the
authority
to
deny,
30


suspend,
or
revoke
the
license
of
a
health
care
facility,
elder
31


group
home,
assisted
living
program,
or
adult
day
services
32


program
for
the
failure
to
comply
with
any
provisions
that
the
33


entity
is
subject
to
that
are
equivalent
to
those
provisions
34


in
Code
chapter
135C,
231B,

authorized

representative
of
DIA
or
the
lawful
enforcement
of
the
laws
or

chapters.
4


The
bill
replaces
references
to
a
certified
volunteer
5


long-term
care
ombudsman
with
a
representative
of
the
office
6


of
long-term
care
ombudsman
in
certain
circumstances
including
7


inspecting
a
facility
upon
a
complaint
of
alleged
violations.
8


The
bill
also
replaces
certain
references
to
inspectors
and
9


investigators
for
inspections
of
health
care
facilities
with
10


references
to
authorized
representatives
of
DIA,
the
department
11


of
human
services,
or
the
office
of
long-term
care
ombudsman,
12


as
applicable.
The
bill
also
provides
that
the
office
of
13


long-term
care
ombudsman
is
required
to
assist
DIA
in
carrying
14


out
the
provisions
of
the
health
care
facilities
Code
chapter.
15


The
bill
replaces
the
informal
review
process
for
contesting
16


regulatory
insufficiencies
identified
through
monitoring
17


evaluations
or
complaint
investigations
of
elder
group
homes
18


and
adult
day
services
programs
with
an
exit
interview,
19


informal
conference,
formal
contest,
and
judicial
review
in
a
20


process
similar
to
that
available
for
health
care
facilities
21


and
assisted
living
programs.
The
informal
conference
is
22


conducted
by
an
independent
reviewer
who
may
affirm,
modify,
23


or
dismiss
the
regulatory
insufficiency.
The
reviewer
must
24


provide
specific
written
reasons
for
the
decision
and
transmit
25


copies
of
that
statement
to
DIA
and
the
elder
group
home
or
26


adult
day
services
program.
An
elder
group
home
or
adult
day
27


services
program
that
wants
to
further
contest
the
independent
28


reviewer’s
affirmed
or
modified
regulatory
insufficiency
may
do
29


so
pursuant
to
the
provisions
in
Code
chapter
17A
for
contested
30


cases.
After
exhausting
the
administrative
remedies,
an
elder
31


group
home
or
adult
day
services
program
may
petition
for
32


judicial
review
pursuant
