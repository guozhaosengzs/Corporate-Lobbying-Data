EXPLANATION
4


This
bill
amends
Code
section
85.34
to
provide
that
5


for
purposes
of
workers’
compensation,
an
employee
who
6


sustains
a
scheduled
injury
and
is
unable
to
return
to
7


employment
providing
substantially
similar
earnings
to
that
8


of
the
preinjury
employment
earning
capacity,
shall
be
paid
9


compensation
during
the
number
of
weeks
in
relation
to
500
10


weeks
as
the
reduction
in
the
employee’s
earning
capacity
11


caused
by
the
disability
bears
in
relation
to
the
earning
12


capacity
that
the
employee
possessed
when
the
injury
occurred.
13


The
bill
also
amends
Code
section
85.64
to
provide
that
an
14


employee
who
has
previously
sustained
a
loss
of
a
body
part
and
15


then
becomes
permanently
disabled
when
that
injury
is
combined
16


with
a
second
compensable
injury
is
entitled
to
compensation
17


out
of
the
state
second
injury
fund
as
long
as
that
second
18


compensable
injury
alone
does
not
cause
the
employee
to
be
19


unable
to
return
to
substantially
similar
employment
and
thus
20


be
eligible
for
benefits
under
the
new
paragraph
“w”
in
Code
21


section
85.34(2).
