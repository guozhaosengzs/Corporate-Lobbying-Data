the

medical
practitioner
or

did
not
direct
the

3


to

The
bill
amends

this
law
to
provide
that

who
is
charged
with
an
OWI
5


violation
while
under
the
influence
of
an

as
an
affirmative
defense,
that
the

dispensed
for
10


the
person
and
was
taken

a

consumption
and
the
pharmacy
information
fails
to
caution
the
14


person
about
the
adverse
effects
of
the
drug
on
driving.
15


Current

also
provides
that

in

bars
