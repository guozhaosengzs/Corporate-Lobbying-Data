FARMER
TAX
PROGRAM.
This

18


farmer
tax
credit
program
which
replaces
the
agricultural
19


assets
transfer
tax
credit
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Iowa
20


finance
authority
(IFA).
Under
the
program,
an

land,
depreciable
agricultural
property,

and
who
assists
a
qualified
beginning
farmer
(farmer)
acquire
24


agricultural
assets
by
a
form
of
specified
legal
arrangement
25


is
entitled
to
claim
a
tax
credit
against
the
taxpayer’s
26


individual
or
corporate
income
tax
liability.
Specifically,
27


the
taxpayer
must
be
eligible
to
hold
agricultural
land
28


generally
under
Iowa’s
corporate
farming
law
(e.g.,

family
farm
corporation,

farm
limited

a

credit.
The

enter
into
an

In
1


addition,
the
farmer
must
be
a
resident
of
this
state;
have
2


sufficient
education,
training,
or
experience
in
farming;

have
access

a

interest
in
an

agricultural
asset
included

the

6


BEGINNING
FARMER
TAX
CREDIT.
The
tax
credit
is
calculated
7


based
on
the
type
of
rent
payment
arrangement
agreed
to
8


by
the
parties,
which
is
either
on
a
cash
basis
in
which
a
9


fixed
payment
is
made
or
a
commodity
share
basis
in
which
the
10


taxpayer
takes
a
percentage
of
the
crop
or
livestock
produced.
11


The
tax
credit
also
takes
into
account
special
risk-sharing
12


arrangements
in
which
the
parties
agree
to
adjust
the
rent
13


amount
based
on
some
future
happening
(e.g.,
crop
yield).
For
14


an
agreement
which
includes
a
rent
payable
on
a
cash
basis,
15


the
tax
credit
amount
equals
5
percent
of
the
gross
amount
16


paid
to
the
taxpayer
under
the
agreement.
For
an
agreement
17


which
includes
rent
payable
on
a
commodity
share
basis,
the
18


tax
credit
amount
equals
15
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
19


the
eligible
taxpayer
from
crops
or
livestock
sold
under
the
20


agreement.
In
the
case
of
a
flexible
arrangement
in
which
21


some
risk
is
shared
between
the
parties,
the
tax
credit
amount
22


equals
15
percent
of
the
amount
paid
to
the
taxpayer
as
a
23


percentage
of
the
gross
value
of
the
commodity.
A
tax
credit
24


cannot
exceed
$50,000
in
any
tax
year.
25


APPLICATIONS
AND
CERTIFICATES.
The
board
is
required
to
26


review
and
approve
applications
for
the
tax
credit.
As
part
27


of
this
process
the
division
must
calculate
the
amount
of
the
28


tax
credit
that
may
be
awarded
to
that
applicant.
The
division
29


must
approve
all
applications
on
a
first-come,
first-served
30


basis
and
issue
tax
credit
certificates
to
approved
taxpayers.
31


IFA
is
allowed
to
issue
up
to
$12
million
in
tax
credit
32


certificates
each
tax
year,
an
increase
from
$6
million
under
33


the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit.

——
CONTINUANCE
OF

CARRYOVER
PROVISIONS.
The
bill
allows
a
taxpayer
who
claimed
6


a
tax
credit
under
the
former
version
of
the
beginning
farmer
7


tax
credit
(the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax

and
an
8


associated,
now

11


BACKGROUND.
The
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
12


was
first
established
in
2006
(2006
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161)
13


and
has
been
subsequently
amended.
Another
form
of
a
tax
14


credit
assisting
beginning
farmers,
referred
to
as
the
custom
15


farming
contract
tax
credit,
was
established
in
2013
(2013
Iowa
16


Acts,
chapter
125).
Both
tax
credits
were
under
the
beginning
17


farmer
tax
credit
program
and
administered
by
the
agricultural
18


development
board
(board)
acting
as
the
agricultural
19


development
authority
and
subject
to
a
limit
of
$12
million.
20


The
program
was
transferred
to
IFA
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
21


100,
and
2014
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1080).
Amendments
to
the
22


agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
the
custom
farming
23


contract
tax
credit
were
repealed
on
December
31,
2017
(2013
24


Iowa
Acts,
chapter
125),
except
for
a
provision
which
extended
25


the
tax
credit
carryover
from
5
to
10
years.
The
funding
limit
26


was
restored
to
its
present
$6
million
limit.
27


EFFECTIVE
AND
RETROACTIVE
APPLICABILITY.
The
bill
takes


28


effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
29


2019,
to
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date.
