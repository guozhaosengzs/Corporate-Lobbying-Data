H.F.
_____


(e.g.,
cigarette,
cigar,
cigarillo,
or
pipe).
The
prohibition
1


does
not
apply
to
the
extent
that
federal
law,
including
2


the
federal
Food,
Drug,
and
Cosmetic
Act,
authorizes
as
its
3


intended
use
the
introduction
of
harvested
hemp
or
a
hemp
4


product
by
a
method
of
inhalation.
5


BACKGROUND.
The
bill
amends
provisions
enacted
in
2019
Iowa
6


Acts,
chapter
130
(Iowa’s
2019
Act),
including
new
Code
chapter
7


204,
the
“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
(IHA)
(see
Code
section
204.1),
8


authorizing
the
production
of
a
certain
type
of
cannabis
9


(sativa
L.)
and
providing
for
the
manufacture,
sale,
and
10


transportation
of
hemp
products,
if
the
hemp
or
hemp
product
11


has
a
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
concentration
of
not
12


more
than
0.3
percent
on
a
dry
weight
basis
(Code
section
13


204.2).
Iowa’s
2019
Act
was
enacted
after
the
enactment
of
14


the
federal
Agriculture
Improvement
Act
of
2018,
commonly
15


known
as
the
2018
farm
bill,
including
provisions
allowing
the
16


production
of
hemp
(7
U.S.C.
§1639o
et
seq.).
The
federal
17


hemp
law
allows
states
and
tribes
to
assume
primary
regulatory
18


authority
over
the
production
of
hemp
by
submitting
a
plan
19


for
approval
by
the
United
States
department
of
agriculture
20


(USDA).
The
USDA
has
neither
approved
nor
disapproved
Iowa’s
21


state
plan.
By
its
own
terms,
the
federal
hemp
law
does
22


not
affect
or
modify
the
federal
Food,
Drug,
and
Cosmetic
23


Act
(21
U.S.C.
§301
et
seq.),
and
therefore
it
preserves
the
24


authority
of
the
United
States
food
and
drug
administration
25


to
regulate
articles
that
may
be
introduced
in
the
body
of
a
26


human
or
animal
(see
7
U.S.C.
§1639r).
Generally,
the
IHA
is
27


to
be
implemented
on
the
publication
date
of
that
edition
of
28


the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
that
includes
a
statement
29


by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(DALS)
30


certifying
USDA
approval
of
the
state
plan.
31


PENALTIES.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
violates
32


the
bill’s
provisions
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor
which
33


is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
34


a
fine
of
at
least
$315
but
not
more
than
$1,875.
