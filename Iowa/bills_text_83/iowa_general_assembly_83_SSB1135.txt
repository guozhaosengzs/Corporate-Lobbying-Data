The
bill
requires
a
copy
of
the
application
to
be
submitted

to
the
state
public
defender.
3


The
bill
prohibits
the
payment
of
state
funds
to
a
privately
4


retained
attorney
unless
the
court
determines
that
the
5


represented
person
is
indigent
and
unable
to
pay
for
the
6


expenses
sought
to
be
paid
by
the
attorney,
the
expense
of
the
7


attorney
is
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
representation
of
8


an
indigent
person
for
which
counsel
could
have
been
appointed,
9


and
the
moneys
paid
or
to
be
paid
by
or
on

of
the
10


indigent
person
to
the
private
attorney
are
insufficient
to
11


pay
all
or
a
portion
of
the
expenses
sought
to
be
paid
from
12


state
funds.
In
determining
whether
the
moneys
paid
or
to
be
13


paid
to
the
attorney
are
insufficient,
the
bill
requires
the
14


court
to
add
the
hours
previously
worked
to
the
hours
expected
15


to
be
worked
to
finish
the
case
and
to
multiply
that
sum
by
the
16


hourly
rate
of
compensation
specified
under
Code
section
815.7.
17


If
this
calculation
is
greater
than
the
moneys
paid
or
to
be
18


paid
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
indigent
person
to
the
attorney,

insufficient
20


to
pay
all
or
a
portion
of
the
expenses
sought
to
be
paid
21


from
state
funds,
and
the
court
may
authorize
the
payment
of
22


state
funds
to
the
extent
the
moneys
paid
or
to
be
paid
to
the
23


attorney
are
insufficient
to
pay
the
expenses
as
calculated
24


by
the
court.
If
the
private
attorney
is
retained
on
a
flat
25


fee
agreement,
and
a
precise
record
of
hours
worked
is
not
26


available,
the
bill
requires
the
attorney
to
provide
the
court
27


a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
time
expended
to
allow
the
court
28


to
determine
whether
state
funds
must
be
paid
to
the
attorney.
29


The
bill
provides
that
either
the
attorney
for
the
indigent
30


person
or
a
representative
of
the
office
of
the
state
public
31


defender
may
participate
in
a
hearing
on
the
application
32


by

If
the

finds
the

of
the

33


incurred
or
to
be
incurred
by
a
privately
retained
attorney
are
34


reasonable
and

Following

5


representing
