II
——
ALTERNATIVE

Division
II
of
the
bill
allows
a

alternative
project
delivery
contract
in
circumstances
that
27


normally
require
the

entity
to
use
competitive

procedures.
Currently,
most
government
entities
must
29


use
a
competitive
bidding
process

when
that
project
is
estimated
to
cost
at
least
as
much
as
a

The

a


32


government
entity
to
include
the

The

_____


The
second
type
of
alternative
project
delivery
method
is
1


the
design-build
contract,
which
allows
for
the
selection
of
2


design-builders
in
either
a
three-phase
or
two-phase
process.
3


Under
the
design-build
process,
a
government
entity
may
retain
4


a
bridging
criteria
professional
to
advise
the
government
5


entity
on
design-build
matters.
In
the
three-phase
process,
6


the
government
entity
shall
first
request
statements
of
7


qualifications
from
design-builders.
The
government
entity
8


shall
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
than
five
qualified
9


design-builders
to
move
on
to
phases
two
and
three.
In
10


the
second
phase,
the
government
entity
shall
solicit
11


technical
proposals
and
conceptual
designs
from
the
remaining
12


design-builders.
The
government
entity
shall
pay
a
stipend
13


to
any
design-builder
that
participates
in
phase
two
but
14


whose
contract
the
entity
does
not
select.
The
third
phase
15


involves
the
design-builders
submitting
construction
costs.
16


The
government
entity
shall
award
points
for
each
proposal.
If
17


the
government
entity
chooses
to
award
a
contract,
it
shall
18


award
the
contract
to
the
design-builder
with
the
highest
point
19


total.
20


If
the
government
entity
uses
the
two-phase
process,
the
21


government
entity
will
request
qualifications
and
include
22


its
selection
criteria.
The
government
entity
will
rank
the
23


qualifications
of
a
design-builder.
In
the
second
phase,
the
24


government
entity
shall
negotiate
with
the
highest-ranked
25


design-builder.
If
the
two
parties
cannot
agree
to
a
contract
26


with
terms
and
conditions
acceptable
to
the
government
27


entity,
those
negotiations
shall
be
formally
terminated
28


and
the
government
entity
shall
negotiate
with
the
next
29


highest-ranked
design-builder.
That
process
shall
continue
30


until
the
government
entity
can
negotiate
a
contract
with
a
31


design-builder
with
terms
and
conditions
acceptable
to
the
32


government
entity.
