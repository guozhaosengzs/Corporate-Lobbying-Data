allows
the

12


of
the
credit
union
division
of
the
department
of
commerce
13


to
subpoena
witnesses

of
an

of
a
15

This

expands
16


the

allowing
the
17


superintendent
to
compel
the
production
of
any
relevant

18


related

or
related
to

superintendent
of

produce
a

the

may

apply

of
any

such
25


an
order
issued
by
the
district
court
without
reasonable
cause
26


constitutes
