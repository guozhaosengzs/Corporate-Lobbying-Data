of
90
percent
for

years

bill
modifies
the
amount
and
methodology
for
calculating
the
3


assessment
limitation
for
parcels
within
those
classifications
4


of
property.
Instead
of
a
uniform

of

for
5


valuations
established
for
the
assessment
year
beginning
6


January
1,
2020,
and
each

year
thereafter,
the
7


portion
of
actual
value
at
which
each
parcel
of
commercial
8


property
shall
be
assessed
shall
be
the
sum
of
the
following:
9


(1)
an
amount
equal
to
the
product
of
the
assessment
limitation
10


percentage
applicable
to
residential
property
multiplied
by
11


the
actual
value
of
the
property
that
exceeds
$0
but
does
not
12


exceed
$150,000;
and
(2)
an
amount
equal
to
90
percent
of
the
13


actual
value
of
the
property
for
that
assessment
year
that
14


exceeds
$150,000.
The
bill
establishes
a
similar
provision
15


for
industrial
property
and
provides
that
the
assessed
value
16


of
railway
company
property
shall
be
determined
in
the
same
17


manner
as
commercial
property.
The
changes
to
the
methodology
18


and
amount
of
assessment
limitations
for
commercial
property
19


and
industrial
property
also
applies
to
the
calculation
of
20


commercial
and
industrial
property
tax
replacement
payments
21


under
Code
section
441.21A,
as
amended
in
the
bill.
22


Code
section
441.21A
calculates
and
funds
the
commercial
23


and
industrial
property
tax
replacement
payments
to
political
24


subdivisions
in
the
state.
Under
current
law,
the
amount
of
25


the
replacement
claim
for
each
taxing
district
is
equal
to
the
26


difference
between
the
assessed
valuation
of
all
commercial


27


and
industrial
property
located
in
the
taxing
district
that
is
28


subject
to
assessment
and
taxation
and
the
total
actual
value
29


of
all
such
property
located
in
the
taxing
district
multiplied
30


by
the
tax
rate
specified
for
the
taxing
district,
and
then
31


divided
by
$1,000.
32


The
annual
appropriation
for
the
commercial
and
industrial
33


property
tax
replacement
payments
is
the
amount

that
for

commercial
17


property
and

23


year
beginning

until
the

is
equal
25


to
or
below
the
percentage
that

the
