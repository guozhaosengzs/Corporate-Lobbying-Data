The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
relates
to
fees
for
services
provided
by
the
child
3


support
recovery
unit
(unit).
Currently,
individuals
who
apply
4


for
child
support
services
in
nonassistance
cases
pay
a
$25
5


application
fee.
The
bill
eliminates
the
$25
application
fee.
6


The
bill
also
amends
the
provision
relating
to
the
payment
7


of
an
annual
fee
for
individuals
who
receive
services
from
8


the
unit
in
nonassistance
cases.
The
current
state
statute
9


specifies
that
the
annual
fee
is
$25
and
is
collected
from
10


the
obligee
after
$500
in
support
has
been
distributed
to
the
11


family.
Under
the
bill,
which
cites
to
the
revised
federal
12


law,
the
fee
will
be
$35
and
will
be
collected
from
the
obligee
13


after
$550
in
support
has
been
distributed
to
the
family.
By
14


citing
directly
to
the
federal
law
rather
than
specifying
an
15


amount
in
state
statute,
any
changes
in
the
federal
law
will
16


automatically
govern
the
amount
of
the
annual
fee
without
the
17


need
for
changes
in
the
state
statute.
18


The
bill
also
makes
conforming
changes.
