All
of

2


are
currently
subject
to
a
series
of
penalties
ranging

distinction
between
an
13


infliction
of
an
injury
and
serious
injury
or
death
currently
14


applicable

The
bill
defines
an
injury
15


to
include
an
animal’s
disfigurement,
the
impairment
of
an
16


animal’s
health,

the

a

PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
ANIMAL
ABUSE.
Under
current
law,
12


a
person
commits
animal
abuse
by
intentionally
inflicting
13


an
injury
upon
an
animal.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
14


commits
the
offense
by
intentionally,
knowingly,
or
recklessly
15


inflicting
the
injury.
The
bill
amends
an
exception
that
16


currently
applies
to
a
person
who
is
the
owner
or
acting
17


with
the
owner’s
consent.
Under
the
bill,
this
exception
18


would
only
be
available
if
the
animal
is
euthanized
and
is
19


either
(1)
in
a
state
of
permanent
pain
or
suffering
or
(2)
a
20


rabbit
being
prepared
for
consumption.
A
new
exception
also
21


allows
practices
associated
with
altering
a
dog’s
appearance,
22


including
tail
docking
or
removing
the
dewclaw
of
a
dog,
if
23


the
procedure
is
performed
by
a
commercial
breeder
licensed
24


by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(Code
25


chapter
162).
The
bill
reduces
the
penalty
from
an
aggravated
26


to
a
serious
misdemeanor
for
committing
an
offense
that
causes
27


an
animal
injury
but
does
not
cause
an
animal
serious
injury
28


or
death.
It
retains
the
penalty
of
aggravated
misdemeanor
29


if
the
animal
suffers
serious
injury
or
death.
In
that
case,
30


the
offense
is
subject
to
an
enhanced
penalty
as
a
class
“D”
31


felony.
32


PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
ANIMAL
NEGLECT.
Under
current
law,
a
33


person
commits
animal
neglect
by
(1)
impounding
or
confining
an
34


animal
and
(2)
failing

supply
of
food
or
water,
or
failing
to
provide
the
animal

with
adequate
shelter.
The
bill
provides
that
the
offense
is
2


committed
by
a
person
who
(1)
owns
or
has
custody
of
an
animal,
3


(2)
confines
that
animal,
and
(3)
intentionally,
knowingly,
or
4


recklessly
fails
to
provide
the
animal
with
conditions
for
the
5


animal’s
welfare.
These
include
access
to
nutritional
food,

potable
water,
adequate
sanitary
conditions,
ventilated
shelter
7


from
the
weather,
grooming,
and
veterinary
care
if
required
8


to
relieve
the
animal
from
distress.
The
bill
eliminates
a
9


provision
that
includes
inflicting
upon
an
animal
unjustified
10


pain,
including
torture.
It
retains
the
ordinary
criminal
11


penalty
which
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
but
provides
that
the
12


offense
does
not
involve
an
injury
or
death.
For
an
offense
13


that
causes
an
animal
to
suffer
an
injury,
other
than
serious
14


injury
or
death,
the
new
penalty
is
a
serious
misdemeanor.
For
15


an
offense
that
causes
an
animal
to
suffer
a
serious
injury
or
16


death,
the
new
penalty
is
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
which
may
17


be
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony.
18


PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
ANIMAL
TORTURE.
Under
current
law,
a
19


person
commits
animal
torture
by
(1)
acting
with
a
depraved
20


or
sadistic
intent
to
(2)
inflict
severe
and
prolonged
pain
21


or
suffering,
or
death
upon
an
animal.
The
bill
provides
22


that
a
person
commits
the
offense
by
(1)
intentionally
or
23


knowingly
(but
not
recklessly)
inflicting
severe
and
prolonged
24


or
repeated
physical
pain
upon
an
animal,
and
(2)
causes
the
25


animal’s
serious
injury
or

criminal

to
a
class
