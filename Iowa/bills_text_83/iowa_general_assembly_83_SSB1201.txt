Private

——

infrastructure
support
options
for
customers.

1.
The
general
assembly
recognizes
the
importance
of
3


electric
utility
infrastructure,
including
electric
generation,
4


transmission,
and
distribution
systems,
to
provide
electric
5


service
to
all
customers
in
this
state,
whether
electricity
6


is
generated
by
a
public
utility,
by
a
customer,
or
on
behalf
7


of
a
customer.
The
general
assembly
also
recognizes
that
8


tariffs
for
electric
service
are
traditionally
designed
for
9


the
provision
of
full
electric
service
to
customers,
not
10


taking
into
account
the
private
generation
of
electricity.
It
11


is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
require
customers
12


who
utilize
private
generation
to
pay
their
share
of
costs
13


of
electric
utility
infrastructure,
thereby
eliminating
14


cross-subsidization.
It
is
also
the
intent
of
the
general
15


assembly
to
provide
such
customers
with
options
to
pay
their
16


share
of
costs.
17


2.
For
purposes
of
this
section,
unless
the
context
18


otherwise
requires:
19


a.
“Avoided
cost”
means
the
energy
rate
paid
by
an
electric
20


utility
for
energy
purchases
from
a
private
generation
customer
21


established
in
the
electric
utility’s
board-approved
tariff
for
22


cogeneration
facilities
and
small
power
production
facilities
23


in
compliance
with
the
federal
Public
Utility
Regulatory
24


Policies
Act
of
1978,
16
U.S.C.
§2601
et
seq.
25


b.
“Private
generation
customer”
means
an
electric
utility
26


customer
who
utilizes
a
private
generation
facility.
27


c.
“Private
generation
facility”
means
an
alternate
energy
28


production
facility
that
is
owned,
leased,
operated
by,
or
29


operated
on
behalf
of
a
private
generation
customer
and
whose
30


production
of
electricity
is
used
to
offset
a
portion
or
all
of
31


the
customer’s
electricity
bill
or
usage
that
would
otherwise
32


be
purchased
from
an
electric
utility.
33


3.
A
rate-regulated
electric
utility
may
file
tariffs
with
34


the
board
applicable
to
any
private
generation
customer
who

This
