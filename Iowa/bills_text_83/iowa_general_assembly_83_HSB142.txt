Compliance
with

laws.

A
court
shall
not
enter
an
order
under
this
chapter
that
2


would
result
in
a
violation
of
state
or
federal

EXPLANATION
5


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
6


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
7


This
bill
relates
to
a
defendant
filing
an
application
for
8


an
order
to
require
that
DNA
analysis
be
performed
on
evidence
9


after
conviction.
10


The
bill
modifies
or
adds
numerous
definitions
under
Code
11


chapter
81
(DNA
profiling).
12


The
bill
defines
“combined
DNA
index
system”
to
mean
a
13


national,
searchable
DNA
database
created
and
maintained
by
the
14


federal
bureau
of
investigation
where
DNA
profiles
are
stored
15


and
searched
at
a
local,
state,
or
national
level.
16


The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
“DNA
profile”
to
include
17


the
objective
form
of
the
results
of
DNA
analysis
performed
on
18


a
forensic
sample
or
an
individual’s
DNA
sample.
Currently,
19


“DNA
profile”
means
the
objective
form
of
the
results
of
DNA
20


analysis
performed
on
a
DNA
sample,
and
the
results
of
all
DNA
21


identification
analysis
on
an
individual’s
DNA
sample
are
also
22


collectively
referred
to
as
the
DNA
profile
of
an
individual.
23


The
bill
defines
“forensic
sample”
to
mean
an
evidentiary
24


item
that
may
contain
DNA
relevant
to
a
crime.
25


The
bill
defines
“keyboard
search”
to
mean
a
manual
keyboard
26


search
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
current
version
of
the


27


national
DNA
index
operational
procedures
manual.
28


The
bill
provides
that
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
of
29


a
felony
or
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
may
make
an
application
30


to
the
court
for
an
order
to
require
that
DNA
profiling
be
31


performed
on
a
forensic
sample
collected
in
the
case
for
which
32


the
defendant
stands
convicted.
Current
law
provides
that
such
33


a
defendant
who
has
not
previously
been
required
to
submit
a
34


DNA
sample
for
DNA
profiling
may
make
such
an
application.

The
bill
requires
the
defendant’s
application
for
an
order
1


to
require
DNA
profiling
be
performed
on
a
forensic
sample
2


collected
in
the
case
to
include
a
statement
detailing
why
3


the
DNA
profiling
results
would
have
changed
the
outcome
of
4


the
trial
or
invalidated
a
guilty
plea
if
the
requested
DNA
5


profiling
had
been
conducted
prior
to
the
conviction.
Current
6


law
requires
such
application
to
state
why
DNA
evidence
would
7


have
changed
the
outcome
of
the
trial
or
invalidated
a
guilty
8


plea
if
DNA
profiling
had
been
conducted
prior
to
conviction.
9


The
bill
specifies
that
the
defendant’s
application
shall
10


be
served
upon
the
county
attorney
and
upon
the
laboratory,
if
11


known
by
the
defendant,
holding
the
biological
evidence.
12


Subject
to
the
confidentiality
provisions
of
Code
section
13


81.8,
the
bill
requires
that
any
DNA
profiling
of
the
defendant
14


or
an
unknown
person,
or
other
biological
evidence
conducted
15


by
the
state
or
by
the
defendant
shall
be
disclosed
and
the
16


results
of
such
profiling
or
other
testing
be
described
in
17


the
motion
or
answer.
Current
law
requires
DNA
profiling,
18


not
DNA
testing
results,
to
be
disclosed
and
does
not
require
19


disclosure
when
the
DNA
profiling
results
in
the
DNA
profile
of
20


an
unknown
person.
21


The
bill
specifies
that
the
court
shall
grant
the
22


defendant’s
application
for
an
order
to
require
that
DNA
23


profiling
be
performed
on
a
forensic
sample
collected
in
24


the
case
for
which
the
person
stands
convicted
when
either
25


DNA
profiling
has
not
been
performed
on
the
forensic
sample
26


or
when
DNA
profiling
has
been
previously
performed
on
27


the
forensic
sample
and
the
defendant
is
requesting
DNA
28


profiling
using
a
new
method
or
technology
approved
by
the
29


accrediting
organization
and
authorized
by
the
federal
bureau
30


of
investigation
for
DNA
profiling
that
is
substantially
more
31


probative
than
prior
DNA
profiling.
32


Additionally,
the
bill
specifies
that
the
defendant’s
33


application
shall
be
granted
if
a
sufficient
chain
of
custody
34


has
been
established
for
the
forensic
sample;
