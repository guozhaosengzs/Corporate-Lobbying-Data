The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
20


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
21


This
bill
requires
any
governmental
entity
which
exercises
22


jurisdiction
over
a
highway
to
construct
and
maintain
rumble
23


strips
on
certain
highways.
The
bill
defines
the
term
“rumble
24


strips”.
Under
the
bill,
rumble
strips
are
required
in
advance
25


of

However,

cost
of
34


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
