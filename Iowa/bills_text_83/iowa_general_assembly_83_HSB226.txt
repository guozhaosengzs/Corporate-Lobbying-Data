EXPLANATION
11


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
12


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
13


This
bill
is
based
on
the
uniform
electronic
legal
14


material
Act
(UELMA),
prepared
by
the
national
conference
of
15


commissioners
of
uniform
state
laws
in
2011.
The
prefatory
16


note
stresses
the
need
for
flexible
approaches
by
adopting
17


jurisdictions,
observing
that
the
UELMA
“does
not
require
18


specific
technologies,
leaving
the
choice
of
technology
for
19


authentication
and
preservation
up
to
the
states”.
20


Specifically,
the
bill
amends
Code
chapter
2B
that
provides
21


for
the
publication
of
official
and
unofficial
editions
of
22


legal
publications,
including
the
Iowa
Constitution,
the
Iowa
23


Acts,
the
Iowa
Code,
the
Iowa
Administrative
Bulletin,
and
the
24


Iowa
Administrative
Code.
The
bill
requires
the
legislative
25


services
agency
when
acting
as
custodian
of
information
in
a
26


secure
electronic
repository,
provide
for
the
publication
of
27


legal
material
associated
with
those
publications
to
enable
28


user
access
on
a
permanent
and
secure
basis,
including
by
29


providing
methods
of
authentication
and
preservation
of
30


electronic
records.
The
bill
provides
for
the
implementation
31


of
its
provisions
according
to
a
plan
or
report
to
be
submitted
32


to
the
legislative
council
which
will
include
such
methods.
33


The
bill
makes
a
number
of
other
conforming
and
miscellaneous
34


changes
to
the
same
Code
chapter
to
implement
the
UELMA
and
