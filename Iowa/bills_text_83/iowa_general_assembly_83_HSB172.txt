The

explanation’s

20


This
bill
changes
certain
procedures
relating
to
abandoned
21


structures
and
abatement.
22


The
current
definition
of
“abandoned”
or
“abandonment”
23


requires
a
property
to
have
been
in
violation
of
a
housing
or
24


building
code
for
at
least
six
months.
The
bill
removes
the
25


time
element
from
the
definition
and
states
that
evidence
of
26


financial
obligations
in
respect
to
the
building
does
not
rebut
27


a
finding
of
abandonment
if
the
property
is
substantially
in
28


need
of
abatement.
The
bill
requires
a
property
to
remain
29


vacant
for
135
days
before
a
person
may
request
a
responsible
30


building
official
to
inspect
a
building
to
determine
whether
31


it
is
abandoned
and
in
need
of
abatement.
Responsible
32


building
official
is
defined
in
the
bill.
The
bill
allows
the
33


responsible
building
inspector
to
make
an
application
to
the
34


court
for
an
administrative
warrant
if
necessary
to
conduct

_____


inspection
of
a
building.
1


The
term
“building”
currently
includes
buildings
and
2


structures
only.
The
bill
adds
mobile
and
manufactured
homes
3


that
have
become
real
property
pursuant
to
Code
section
435.26.
4


Current
law
relies
on
the
current
definition
of
“abandoned”
5


to
start
the
clock
for
when
a
person
may
file
a
petition
6


for
abatement.
A
hearing
is
required
to
determine
if
the
7


building
is
abandoned
or
is
a
public
nuisance.
Currently,
a
8


petitioner
must
make
service
on
the
building
owner
in
one
of
9


three
methods.
The
bill
requires
a
property
to
remain
vacant
10


for
at
least
135
days
before
a
person
may
file
a
petition
for
11


abatement.
The
bill
does
not
allow
for
a
personal
judgment
12


against
any
party
and
requires
the
petition
to
be
solely
13


against
the
interested
persons’
interest
in
the
property.
The
14


bill
includes
additional
methods
of
service.
The
bill
allows
a
15


responsible
building
official’s
written
inspection
report
to
be
16


accepted
as
evidence
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
motion
in
a
17


proceeding
under
Code
chapter
657A
under
certain
circumstances.
18


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
court
finds
that
a
building
is
19


abandoned,
unless
the
court
order
establishes
otherwise,
the
20


property
is
deemed
continuously
abandoned
from
the
date
the
21


action
is
indexed
pursuant
to
Code
section
617.10.
A
property
22


cannot
be
claimed
as
homestead,
and
a
mortgagor,
or
successor
23


in
interest
of
record,
cannot
reject
a
nonjudicial
foreclosure
24


written
notice
served
on
the
mortgagor,
or
successor
in
25


interest,
after
such
date.
26


Current
law
allows
an
owner
to
collect
reasonable
attorney
27


fees
actually
incurred
from
a
petitioner
if
the
court
finds
28


that
the
building
in
question
is
not
abandoned
or
a
public
29


nuisance.
The
bill
allows
the
court
to
require
the
petitioner
30


to
pay
an
interested
party’s
reasonable
attorney
fees
unless
31


the
interested
party
was
properly
noticed
and
did
not
appear
32


for
an
inspection
pursuant
to
Code
section
657A.1A.
33


Current
law
requires
the
court
to
conduct

to

interested
persons
the
opportunity
to
abate
a
public
nuisance.
1


The
bill
eliminates
such
hearing
and
creates
a
new
process
for
2


interested
persons
to
demonstrate
their
intent
and
ability
to
3


abate
the
nuisance
and
act
as
a
receiver.
If
the
building
4


is
a
historic
building
or
located
in
a
historic
district,
5


the
court
shall
give
preference
to
an
economically
feasible
6


rehabilitation
plan
that
preserves
the
historical
nature
of
the
7


building.
8


Current
law
allows
a
court
to
empower
a
receiver
to
issue
9


notes
and
secure
the
notes
by
mortgage
bearing
interest
at
10


the
statutory
rate
and
any
terms
and
conditions
approved
by
11


the
court.
The
bill
allows
the
court
to
provide
for
a
higher
12


interest
rate.
If
the
receiver
contemplates
a
transfer
of
the
13


note
and
mortgage,
at
the
time
that
the
receiver
seeks
court
14


authorization
of
the
contemplated
transfer,
the
receiver
must
15


disclose
to
the
mortgagee
the
contemplated
transfer
in
the
16


receiver’s
application
for
approval
of
the
mortgage.
The
bill
17


provides
immunity
from
liability
for
a
receiver
acting
in
good
18


faith
to
fulfill
the
receiver’s
court-appointed
duties.
19


The
bill
makes
an
interested
party
responsible
for
paying
20


the
mortgagee’s
reasonable
costs
and
attorney
fees
if
the
21


interested
party
pays
off
the
receiver’s
mortgage
loan.
22


The
bill
requires
a
receiver
to
pay
a
plaintiff’s
reasonable
23


attorney
fees
in
most
situations,
but
provides
that
a
24


neighboring
landowner
who
pursued
an
action
in
bad
faith
may
25


be
liable
for
attorney
fees.
The
court
may
bar
such
landowner
26


from
filing
further
actions
under
Code
chapter
657A.
27


The
bill
provides
that
Code
sections
657A.1A
through
657A.10
28


shall
only
apply
to
cities
and
counties
that
adopt
such
