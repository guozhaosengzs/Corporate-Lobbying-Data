_____


the

program
state
cost
per
pupil
is
the
regular
program
1


state
cost
per
pupil
for
the
base
year
plus
the
regular
program
2


supplemental
state
aid
for
the
budget
year,
plus
$10.
Then
3


with
the
budget
year
beginning
July
1,
2021,
and
succeeding
4


budget
years,
the
regular
program
state
cost
per
pupil
will
5


again
be
calculated
as
the
regular
program
state
cost
per
pupil
6


for
the
base
year
plus
the
regular
program
supplemental
state
7


aid
for
the
budget
year.
8


Code
section
257.16C
establishes
a
transportation
equity
9


program
to
provide
additional
funding
for
school
districts
with
10


a
transportation
cost
per
pupil
that
exceeds
the
statewide
11


adjusted
transportation
cost
per
pupil,
as
determined
by
the
12


department
of
management.
The
amount
of
transportation
equity
13


aid
for
each
school
district
is
an
amount
equal
to
the
school
14


district’s
actual
enrollment
for
the
school
year,
excluding
the
15


shared-time
enrollment
for
the
school
year,
multiplied
by
the
16


school
district’s
transportation
cost
per
pupil
differential
17


for
the
budget
year.
Code
section
257.16C
establishes
a
18


transportation
equity
fund
and
appropriates
all
moneys
in
the
19


fund
to
the
department
of
management
for
purposes
of
making
20


the
transportation
equity
aid
payments.
However,
if
the
21


balance
of
the
fund
exceeds
the
amount
necessary
to
make
all
22


transportation
equity
aid
payments,
moneys
remaining
in
the
23


fund
are
required
to
be
used
for
transportation
base
funding
24


payments
as
calculated
under
Code
section
257.16C(4).
25


For
each
fiscal
year
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2020,
26


Code
section
257.16C
appropriates
from
the
general
fund
of
the
27


state
to
the
transportation
equity
fund
the
sum
of
the
amount
28


appropriated
for
the
immediately
preceding
fiscal
year
plus
29


the
product
of
the
amount
appropriated
for
the
immediately
30


preceding
fiscal
year
multiplied
by
the
categorical
percent
31


of
growth
for
the
corresponding
school
budget
year.
The
32


bill
amends
Code
section
257.16C
so
that
this
appropriation
33


calculation
begins
with
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2021,
34


and
appropriates
$26,250,000
to
the
transportation
equity
fund
