DIVISION
I.
This
division
strikes
language
requiring
5


the
director
of
the
department
of
workforce
development
6


to
recompute
wage
credits
for
purposes
of
calculating
an
7


individual’s
maximum
total
amount
of
unemployment
benefits
8


payable
during
a
benefit
year.
The
stricken
language
applied
9


to
an
individual
who
is
laid
off
due
to
the
individual’s
10


employer
going
out
of
business
at
the
factory,
establishment,
11


or
other
premises
at
which
the
individual
was
last
employed
by
12


crediting
the
individual’s
account
with
one-half,
instead
of
13


one-third,
of
the
wages
for
insured
work
paid
to
the
individual
14


during
the
individual’s
base
period.
The
division
also
strikes
15


language
providing
an
additional
13
weeks
of
benefits
to
such
16


individuals
if
the
state
“off”
indicator,
which
relates
to
17


the
rate
of
insured
unemployment
in
the
state,
is
in
effect.
18


This
provision
applies
to
any
week
of
unemployment
benefits
19


beginning
on
or
after
the
first
Sunday
after
the
effective
date
20


of
the
division.
21


Under
current
law,
an
individual
is
disqualified
from
22


eligibility
for
unemployment
benefits
if
the
department
of
23


workforce
development
finds
that
the
individual
has
been
24


discharged
for
misconduct
in
connection
with
the
individual’s
25


employment.
“Misconduct”
is
defined
by
the
department
by
rule.
26


The
division
provides
that
“misconduct”
means
a
deliberate
27


act
or
omission
by
an
employee
that
constitutes
a
material
28


breach
of
the
duties
and
obligations
arising
out
of
the
29


employee’s
contract
of
employment.
“Misconduct”
is
limited
30


to
conduct
evincing
such
willful
or
wanton
disregard
of
an
31


employer’s
interest
as
is
found
in
deliberate
violation
or
32


disregard
of
standards
of
behavior
which
the
employer
has
the
33


right
to
expect
of
employees,
or
in
carelessness
or
negligence

3


The
division
includes
a
nonexclusive
list
of
behaviors
that
4


constitute
misconduct.
5


The
division
strikes
language
providing
that
notifications
6


of
interested
parties
that
a
claim
for
unemployment
benefits
7


has

sent
by

9


specified
by
the
department
selected
by
the
parties.
10


The

that
an

employing
unit
11


refusing
or
failing

file
required
records
is
12


subject
to
a
possible
injunction
by
the
department
for
the
13


violation.
14


The
division
modifies
a
reference
to
plans
for
liquidation
15


of
deficiencies
under
Code
chapter
96
by
an
employer
or
16


employing
unit
to
specify
that
such
a
plan
is
for
the
17


liquidation
of
a
business
to
pay
for
such
deficiencies.
18


The
division
modifies
conditions
for
approval
of
a
voluntary
19


shared
work
program
by
the
department.
The
division
provides
20


that
a
reduction
in
hours
and
corresponding
reduction
in
wages
21


that
must
be
applied
equally
to
all
employees
in
the
affected
22


unit
must
be
applied
equally
for
each
week
reported.
The
23


division
provides
that
an
employer
shall
only
be
authorized
24


one
plan
during
a
24-month
period.
The
division
requires
25


an
employer
to
notify
all
affected
employees
and
receive
26


consent
from
each
participating
employee
before
the
plan
is
27


authorized.
The
division
also
permits
an
employer
to
file
28


an
appeal
in
writing
of
a
denial
or
approval
of
a
plan
or
29


revocation
of
an

from

federal
Workforce
Investment
Act
of
1998
with

32


the
