8


PREAMBLE.
Every

owes
a

uphold
9


the
integrity
and
honor
of
the
general
assembly,
to
10


encourage
respect
for
the
law
and
for
the
general
11


assembly
and
the
members
thereof,
and
to
observe
the

In

reflect
credit
on
the
15


general
assembly,
and
to
inspire
the
confidence,
16


respect,
and
trust
of
the
public,
and

strive
to
17


avoid
both
unethical

and
the

individuals
who
22


are
active
in
the

of
their
localities
and
23


elsewhere
and
that
it
is
necessary

they
maintain

a
livelihood
and
source
of
income
apart
from
their
25


legislative
compensation,
the
following
rules
are
