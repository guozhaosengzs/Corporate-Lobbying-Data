Iowa

by
striking
19

and

specifies
the
provisions
in
2018
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161,
21


sections
99
through
132,
take
effect
January
1,
2023.
22


Currently,
the
two
conditions
are
necessary
for
the
trigger
23


to
occur
include
net
general
fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
24


ending
June
30,
2022,
equaling
or
exceeding
$8.3146
billion,
25


and
also
equaling

exceeding
104
percent
of
the
net
general
26


fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30,
2021.
If
27


these
two
conditions
are
not
satisfied,
current
law
institutes


28


the
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
the
January
1
29


following
the
first
fiscal
year
for
which
the
two
conditions
30


do
occur.
By

31


numerous
tax
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
32


January
1,

described
below.
33


The
tax
changes
include
reducing
the
number
of
individual

income
tax
brackets
from
nine
to

modifying

For
a
married
couple
filing
a
joint
return,
the
taxable
7


income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
are
doubled.
Also,
the
8


taxable
income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
will
be
indexed
to
9


inflation
and
increased
in
future
tax
years,
beginning
in
the
10


tax
year
following
the
2023
tax
year.
11


Under
current
law,
the
starting
point
for
computing
the
12


Iowa
individual
income
tax
is
federal
adjusted
gross
income
13


before
the
net
operating
loss
deduction,
which
is
generally
a
14


taxpayer’s
gross
income
minus
several
deductions.
From
that
15


point,
Iowa
requires
several
adjustments
and
then
provides
16


taxpayers
with
a
deduction
for
federal
income
taxes
paid,
17


and
the
option
to
deduct
a
standard
deduction
or
itemized
18


deductions.
The
bill
changes
the
starting
point
for
computing
19


the
individual
income
tax
to
federal
taxable
income,
which
20


includes
all
deductions
and
adjustments
taken
at
the
federal
21


level
in
computing
tax,
including
a
standard
deduction
22


or
itemized
deductions,
and
the
qualified
business
income
23


deduction
allowed
for
certain
income
earned
from
a
pass-through
24


entity.
Because
the
starting
point
changes
to
federal
taxable
25


income,
and
federal
law
does
not
provide
for
the
filing
status
26


of
married
filing
separately
on
a
combined
return,
the
bill
27


repeals
that
filing
status
option
for
Iowa
tax
purposes.
28


Because
net
operating
loss
is
no
longer
calculated
at
the
state
29


level,
the
bill
requires
a
taxpayer
to
add
back
any
federal
30


net
operating
loss
deduction
carried
over
from
a
taxable
year
31


beginning
prior
to
the
2023
tax
year,
but
allows
taxpayers
32


to
deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net
operating
loss
from
a
prior
33


taxable
year.
The
bill
repeals
the
individual
alternative
34


minimum
tax
(AMT),
allows
an
individual
to
claim

then

the
AMT
credit
in
the
2


tax
year
following
the
2023

The
bill
repeals
most

Iowa-specific
deductions,
exemptions,
and
adjustments
currently
4


available
when
computing
net
income
and
taxable
income
under

Iowa
law,
including
the
Iowa
optional
standard
deduction
and

all
itemized
deductions,
and
the
ability
to

federal

taxes,
except
for

the
2023
tax
8


year
for
taxes
paid,
or
refunds
received,
that
relate
to
a

The
bill
maintains
the
add-back
for
income
from
10


securities
that
are
federally
exempt
but
not
state-exempt,
and
11


for
bonus

amounts.
The
bill
maintains
the
general
12


pension
exclusion
and
the
deduction
for
income
from
federal
13


securities.
The
bill
maintains
the
deduction
for
contributions
14


to
the
Iowa
529
plan,
the
Iowa
ABLE
plan,
a
first-time
15


homebuyer
savings
account,
and
an
individual
development

The
bill
also
maintains
the
deductions
for
military
17


pension
income,
military
active
duty
pay,
social
security
18


retirement
benefits,
certain
payments
received
for

certain

or
individuals
previously
convicted
of
a
felony,
23


certain
organ

Segal

The
bill
modifies
the
existing
deduction
for
health
25


insurance
payments
in
Code
section
422.7(29)
to
make
the

The

also
modifies

existing

deduction
in
Code
29


section
422.7(21)
to
restrict
the

a

The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
“relative”
to
1


include
an
entity
in
which
a
relative
of
the
taxpayer
has
a
2


legal
or
equitable
interest
in
the
entity
as
an
owner,
member,
3


partner,
or
beneficiary.
The
bill
provides
a
new
deduction
4


for
any
income
of
an
employee
resulting
from
the
payment
by
5


an
employer,
whether
paid
to
the
employee
or
a
lender,
of
6


principal
or
interest
on
the
employee’s
qualified
education
7


loan.
The
bill
also
modifies
the
calculation
of
net
income
8


for
purposes
of
the
alternate
tax
calculation
in
Code
section
9


422.5(3)
and
(3B),
and
the
tax
return
filing

in
10


Code
section

to
require
that
any
amount
of
itemized

deduction,
12


or
qualified
business
income
deduction
that
was
allowed
in
13


computing
federal
taxable
income
shall
be
added
back.
14


Under
current
law,
the
starting
point
for
calculating
the
15


corporate
income
tax
and
franchise
tax
is
federal
taxable
16


income
before
the
net
operating
loss
deduction,
because
net
17


operating
loss
is
calculated
at
the
state
level.
The
bill
18


repeals
the
separate
calculation
of
net
operating
loss
at
the
19


state
level.
As
a
result,
the
bill
requires
taxpayers
to
add
20


back
any
federal
net
operating
loss
deduction
carried
over
from
21


a
taxable
year
beginning
prior
to
the

year,
but
allows
22


taxpayers
to
deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net
operating
loss
from
23


a
prior
taxable
year.
The
bill
also
repeals
most
Iowa-specific
24


deductions,
exemptions,
and
adjustments
currently
available
25


when
computing
net
income
and
taxable
income
under
Iowa

26


The
bill
maintains
the
add-back
for
income
from
securities


27


that
are
federally
exempt
but
not
state
exempt,
and
for
bonus
28


depreciation
amounts.
The

maintains
the
deductions
for
29


income
from
federal
securities,
for
foreign
dividend
and
30


subpart
F
income,
for
certain
wages
paid
