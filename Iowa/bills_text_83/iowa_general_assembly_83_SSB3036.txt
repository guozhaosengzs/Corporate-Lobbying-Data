expressly
11


provide

to
make
a
13

have
any
of
the
following
effects:
2


(1)
Benefiting
the
restricted
trustee
as
a
beneficiary
3


of
the

that
a
provision
in

9


second
trust
which
limits

by
an
ascertainable
10


standard
based
on
or
related
to
the
health,

c.
No
restricted
trustee
of
the
first
trust
may
exercise
15


such
authority
over
the
first
trust
to
the
extent
that
doing
16


so
would
have
the
effect
of
increasing
the
distributions
that
17


can
be
made
from
the
second
trust
to
the
restricted
trustees
of
18


the

d.
The
provisions
of
paragraphs
“a”
and

only
apply

restrict
the

if
either
a

a
beneficiary
who
may
change
the
trustee,
is
a
United
States
29


citizen

of
the
following
8


trusts:
9


(1)
A

9


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“fiduciary”
in
Code
10


section
633A.1102
to
include
“trust
director”.
11


The
bill
also
amends
Code
section
633A.4207
to
instead
12


provide
for
powers
to
be
granted
to
a
trust
director.
The
13


bill
further
modifies
Code
section
633A.4207
to
indicate
a
14


person’s
status
as
a
trust
director
or
trust
protector
is
to
15


be
determined
by
the
powers
granted
to
such
person,
not
the
16


language
in
the
governing
instrument.
17


The
bill
strikes
Code
section
633A.4207(3),
which
stated
a
18


person
other
than
a
beneficiary
who
held
the
power
to
direct
19


was
presumptively
a
fiduciary
and
was
liable
for
any
loss
that
20


resulted
from
a
breach
of
the
person’s
fiduciary
duty.
21


The
bill
adds
a
new
subsection
to
Code
section
633A.4213.
22


This
new
subsection
provides
that
if
a
trust
instrument,
or
a
23


trust
protector
authorized
by
the
trust
instrument,
designates
24


that
a
notice,
accounting,
or
report
may
be
delivered
to
the
25


settlor
or
to
a
designated
representative
on
behalf
of
a
26


beneficiary
prior
to
such
beneficiary’s
25th
birthday,
then,
27


to
the
extent
there
is
no
conflict
of
interest
between
the


28


representative
and
the
beneficiary,
all
notices,
accountings,
29


and
reports
served
on
such
representative
with
respect
to
such
30


period
will
have
the
same
effect
as
if
such
beneficiary
had
31


been
served
directly.
32


The
bill
limits
a
trustee’s
decanting
ability
in
several
33


ways.
First,
decanting
is
allowed
when
a
trustee
has
34


discretion
under
the
terms
of
a
governing
instrument
to
make
a

distribution
of
income
or
principal
to
or
for
the
benefit
of
1


one
or
more
beneficiaries
of
a
trust.
2


Second,
before
exercising
the
trustee’s
discretion
to
3


appoint
and
distribute
assets
to
a
second
trust,
the
trustee
4


of
the
first
trust
must
determine
whether
the
appointment
is
5


necessary
or
desirable
after
taking
into
account
the
purposes
6


of
the
first
trust,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
second
7


trust,
and
the
consequences
of
the
distribution.
8


Third,
the
bill
limits
a
restricted
trustee’s
decanting
9


ability.
The
trustee
of
the
first
trust
is
a
“restricted
10


trustee”
if
such
trustee
is
a
beneficiary
of
the
first
trust
or
11


if
a
beneficiary
of
the
first
trust
has
a
power
to
change
the
12


trustees
within
the
meaning
of
Code
section
633A.4215(5).
The
13


bill
provides
a
restricted
trustee
is
prohibited
from
decanting
14


the
trust
if
doing
so
could
benefit
the
restricted
trustee
as
15


a
beneficiary
of
the
first
trust,
unless
the
exercise
of
such
16


authority
is
limited
by
an
ascertainable
standard
related
to
17


health,
education,
maintenance,
or
support.
The
bill
also
18


provides
a
restricted
trustee
is
prohibited
from
decanting
the
19


trust
if
doing
so
could
remove
restrictions
on
discretionary
20


distributions
to
a
beneficiary
imposed
by
the
governing
21


instrument
under
which
the
first
trust
was
created,
except
that
22


a
provision
in
the
second
trust
which
limits
distributions
by
23


an
ascertainable
standard
related
to
the
health,
education,
24


maintenance,
or
support
of
any
such
beneficiary
is
permitted,
25


as
is
a
distribution
to
a
trust
established
pursuant
to
42
26


U.S.C.
§1396p(d)(4).
27


Fourth,
the
second
trust
may
only
have
as
beneficiaries
28


one
or
more
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
first
trust
to
or
for
29


whom
a
discretionary
distribution
of
income
or
principal
may
30


be
made
from
the
first
trust,
or
to
or
for
whom
a
distribution
31


of
income
or
principal
may
be
made
in
the
future
from
the
first
32


trust
at
a
time
or
upon
the
happening
of
an
event
specified
33


under
the
first
trust.


34


Fifth,

of
the

trust
may

authority
over

extent
that
doing

trust
to

of

Sixth,

2503(b)
of
the

Revenue
Code,
13


by
reason
of
the

of
section
2503(c)
of
the
Internal
14

Code,
the
governing
instrument
for

15


is
to
provide
that
the
beneficiary’s
remainder
interest
shall
16


vest
no

than
the
date
upon
which
such
interest
would
have
17


vested
under
the
terms
of
the
governing
instrument
for
the
18


first
trust.
19


Seventh,
the
exercise
of
such
authority
may
not
reduce
any
20


income
interest
of
any
income
beneficiary
of
a
charitable
21

trust

taken

purposes

Code,

tax

purposes
under
any
comparable
provision
of

Eighth,
the
exercise
of
such
authority
does
not
apply

30


of

to

after

exercise
of
such
authority,
the

beneficiary’s
power
of
withdrawal
is
unchanged
with
respect
to

4


The
bill
contains
a
provision
describing
the
legislative
5


intent
of
the
new
decanting
section.
The
new
Code
section
6


is
to
be
declaratory
of
the
common
law
of
this
state,
which
7


permits
distributions
in
further
trust,
and
is
to
be
liberally
8


construed
to

such
intent.
In

the

9


provides
that
no
provision
of
the
new
decanting
section
is
to
10


be
construed
to

the
right
of
any

who

power
to

or

12


The
bill
provides
that

The

The

for
any
loss
that
results
from
