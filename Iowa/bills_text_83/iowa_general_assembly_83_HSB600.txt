EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
civil
actions
involving
asbestos
and
4


silica.
5


The
bill
requires
a
plaintiff
in
an
asbestos
action,
6


including
an
action
alleging
a
nonmalignant
or
a
malignant
7


condition,
or
a
silica
action
involving
silicosis,
to
file
with
8


the
complaint
or
other
initial
pleading
a
sworn
information
9


form
specifying
the
evidence
that
provides
the
basis
for
each
10


claim
against
each
defendant.
The
sworn
information
form
must
11


contain
the
information
as
detailed
in
the
bill.
Current
law
12


does
not
require
a
plaintiff
in
an
asbestos
action,
including
13


an
action
alleging
a
malignant
condition,
or
a
silica
action
14


involving
silicosis,
to
file
a
sworn
information
form
stating
15


the
basis
for
each
claim
against
each
defendant.
16


The
bill
directs
the
court
to
dismiss
an
asbestos
action
or
17


a
silica
action
without
prejudice
on
finding
that
a
plaintiff
18


has
failed
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
The
court
is
also
19


required
to
dismiss
an
asbestos
action
or
silica
action
without
20


prejudice
as
to
each
defendant
for
whom
a
plaintiff
lacks
21


reliable
defendant-specific
evidence
of
sufficient
exposure
to
22


asbestos
or
silica
to
create
a
reasonable
inference
that
the
23


plaintiff
may
be
entitled
to
relief.
The
court
may
dismiss
the
24


action
without
prejudice
as
to
all
defendants
if
the
plaintiff
25


fails
to
comply
with
the
requirements
for
the
sworn
statement.
26


If
a
plaintiff’s
representations
supporting
a
claim
against
27


a
defendant
are
materially
false,
the
bill
allows
the
defendant
28


to
move
the
court
to
strike
the
plaintiff’s
pleading
as
to
that
29


defendant
and
to
award
the
defendant
attorney
fees,
costs,
and
30


any
other
relief
the
court
determines
is
just
and
proper
in
the
31


circumstances.
32


The
provisions
in
the
bill
apply
to
asbestos
actions,
33


including
actions
alleging
a
nonmalignant
or
malignant
34


condition,
or
silica
actions
involving
silicosis
filed
on
or
