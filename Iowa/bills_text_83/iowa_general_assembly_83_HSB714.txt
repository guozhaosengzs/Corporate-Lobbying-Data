EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
9


This
bill
relates
to
county
and
city
finances
by
amending
10


provisions
relating
to
the
issuance
of
bonds
and
authorizing
11


counties
to
establish
and
levy
for
a
capital
improvement
12


reserve
fund.
13


The
bill
authorizes
a
county
to
establish
a
capital
14


improvements
reserve
fund,
and
may
certify
taxes
not
to
exceed
15


67.5
cents
per
$1,000
of
taxable
value
each
year
to
be
levied
16


for
the
fund
for
the
purpose
of
accumulating
moneys
for
the
17


financing
of
specified
capital
improvements,
or
carrying
out
a
18


specific
capital
improvement
plan.
The
authorization
of
the
19


fund
and
levy
are
similar
to
those
authorized
for

under
20


Code
section
384.7.
The
question
of
the
establishment
of
a
21

fund,
the
time
period
during
which
22


a
levy
will
be
made
for
the
fund,
and
the
tax
rate
to
be
levied
23


for
the
fund
is
subject
to
approval
by
the
voters,
and
may
be
24


submitted
at
any
general
election
upon
the
board’s
motion,
or
25


shall
be
submitted
at
the
next
general
election
upon
receipt
of
26


a
valid
petition.
Termination
of
the
levy
is
done
in
the
same
27


manner
as
the
authorization.


28


When
a
county
proposes
to
issue
general
county
purpose
29


bonds,
Code
section
331.442(2)
requires
the
board
of
30


supervisors
to
publish
a
notice
of
the
proposal
to
issue
31


the
bonds,
including
a
statement
of
the
amount
and
purpose
32


of
the
bonds
and
a
statement
of
the
estimated
cost
of
the


33


project
for
which
the
bonds
are
to
be
issued.
The
bill
strikes
34


the
requirement

the
notice

estimated
cost
of
the
project
for
which
the
bonds
are
to
be
1


issued.

If
a
county
proposes
to
carry
out
a
general
county
purpose
3


using
funds
from
the
issuance
of

obligation
bonds,
4


generally
the
issuance
of
such
bonds
must
first
be
approved

5


the
registered

of
the
county.
Current
law
establishes
6


an
exception
by
providing
that
a
county,
in
lieu
of
calling
7


an
election,
may
institute
proceedings
for
the
issuance
of
8


bonds
for
a
general
county
purpose
by
notice
and
publication
9


of
the
proposal
to
issue
the
bonds
that
includes
a
notice
of
10


the
right
to
petition
for
an
election,
subject
to
the
following
11


bond
amount
and
county

$100,000;
(2)
in
counties
having
a
population
of
14


over
20,000
and
not
over
50,000,
in
an
amount
of
not
more
than
15


$200,000;
and
(3)
in
counties
having
a
population
of
over
16


50,000,
in
an
amount
of
not
more
than
$300,000.
However,
if
17


at
any
time
before
the
date
fixed
for
taking
action
for
the
18


issuance
of
the
bonds,
a
valid
petition
is
filed
with
the
19


county
auditor
asking
that
the
question
of
issuing
the
bonds
20


be
submitted
to
the
registered
voters
of
the
county,
the
board
21


of
supervisors
shall
either
by
resolution
declare
the
proposal
22


to
issue
the
bonds
to
have
been
abandoned
or
shall
direct
the
23


county
commissioner
of
elections
to
call
a
special
election
24


upon
the
question
of
issuing
the
bonds.
25


The
bill
increases
the
bond
amount
limitations
for
each
of
26


the
county
population
categories
to
the
following
amounts:
(1)
27


in
counties
having
a
population
of
20,000
or
less,
in
an
amount
28


of
not
more
than
$400,000;
(2)
in
counties
having
a
population
29


of
over
20,000
and
not
over
50,000,
in
an
amount
of
not
more


30


than
$700,000;
and
(3)
in
counties
having
a
population
of
over
31


50,000,
in
an
amount
of
not
more
than

million.
32


The
bill
amends
the
provisions
governing
the
issuance
of
33


essential
county
purpose
bonds
and

corporate
purpose
34


bonds
for
