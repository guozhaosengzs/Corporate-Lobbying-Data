The
bill
permits
an
4


instructor
to
teach
CTE
classes
at
a
community
college
if
the
5


instructor
possesses
an
associate
degree
in
the
CTE
field
of
6


instruction
in
which
the
person
is
teaching,
if
such
degree
7


is
considered
terminal
for
that
field
of
instruction,
and
the
8


instructor
has
at
least
3,000
hours
of
recent
and
relevant
work
9


experience
in
the
area
in
which
the
instructor
teaches
classes.
10


Currently,
an
instructor
must
have
a
baccalaureate

degree
relating
to
the

6,000
hours
of
recent
and
relevant
work
experience
in
the
area
15


in

the
latter
case,

if
the

a
career

chapter
272,
