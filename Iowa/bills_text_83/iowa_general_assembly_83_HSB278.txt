take
effect
January
1,
2023.
1


Currently,
the
two
conditions
are
necessary
for
the
trigger
2


to
occur
include
net
general
fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
3


ending
June
30,
2022,
equaling
or
exceeding
$8.3146

and
also
equaling

exceeding
104
percent
of
the
net
general
5


fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30,

If
6


these
two
conditions
are
not
satisfied,
current
law
institutes
7


the
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
the
January
1
8


following
the
first
fiscal
year
for
which
the
two
conditions
9


do
occur.
By
striking
the
“trigger”,
the
bill
sets
in
motion
10


numerous
tax
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
11


January
1,
2023,
described
below.
12


INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAX.
The
tax
changes
include
reducing
the
13


number
of
individual
income
tax
brackets
from
nine
to
four,
and
14


modifying
the
taxable
income
amounts
and
tax
rates
as
follows:
15


Income
over:
But
not
over:
Tax
Rate:
16


1)
$0
$6,000
4.40%
17


2)
$6,000
$30,000
4.82%

3)
$30,000
$75,000
5.70%
19


4)
$75,000
6.50%
20


For
a
married
couple
filing
a
joint
return,
the
taxable
21


income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
are
doubled.
Also,
the
22


taxable
income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
will
be
indexed
to
23


inflation
and
increased
in
future
tax
years,
beginning
in
the
24


tax
year
following
the
2023
tax
year.
25


INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAX
CALCULATION.
Under
current
law,
the
26


starting
point
for
computing
the
Iowa
individual
income
tax
is
27


federal
adjusted
gross
income
before
the
net
operating
loss
28


deduction,
which
is
generally
a
taxpayer’s
gross
income
minus
29


several
deductions.
From
that
point,
Iowa
requires
several
30


adjustments
and
then
provides
taxpayers
with
a
deduction
31


for
federal
income
taxes
paid,
and
the
option
to
deduct
a
32


standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions.
The
bill
changes
33


the
starting
point
for
computing
the
individual
income
tax
34


to
federal
taxable
income,
which
includes
all
deductions
and
35

_____


adjustments
taken
at
the
federal
level
in
computing
tax,
1


including
a
standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions,
and
the
2


qualified
business
income
deduction
allowed
for
certain
income
3


earned
from
a
pass-through
entity.
Because
the
starting
point
4


changes
to
federal
taxable
income,
and
federal
law
does
not
5


provide
for
the
filing
status
of
married
filing
separately
6


on
a
combined
return,
the
bill
repeals
that
filing
status
7


option
for
Iowa
tax
purposes.
Because
net
operating
loss
is
8


no
longer
calculated
at
the
state
level,
the
bill
requires
a
9


taxpayer
to
add
back
any
federal
net
operating
loss
deduction
10


carried
over
from
a
taxable
year
beginning
prior
to
the
2023
11


tax
year,
but
allows
taxpayers
to
deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net
12


operating
loss
from
a
prior
taxable
year.
The
bill
repeals
the
13


individual
alternative
minimum
tax
(AMT),
allows
an
individual
14


to
claim
any
remaining
AMT
credit
against
the
individual’s
15


regular
tax
liability
for
the
2023
tax
year,
and
then
repeals
16


the
AMT
credit
in
the
tax
year
following
the
2023
tax
year.
17


The
bill
repeals
most
Iowa-specific
deductions,
exemptions,
18


and
adjustments
currently
available
when
computing
net
income
19


and
taxable
income
under
Iowa
law,
including
the
Iowa
optional
20


standard
deduction
and
all
itemized
deductions,
and
the
ability
21


to
deduct
federal
income
taxes,
except
for
a
one-year
phase
22


out
in
the
2023
tax
year
for
taxes
paid,
or
refunds
received,
23


that
relate
to
a
prior
year.
The
bill
maintains
the
add-back
24


for
income
from
securities
that
are
federally
exempt
but
not
25


state-exempt,
and
for
bonus
depreciation
amounts.
The
bill
26


maintains
the
general
pension
exclusion
and
the
deduction
27


for
income
from
federal
securities.
The
bill
maintains
the


28


deduction
for
contributions
to
the
Iowa
529
plan,
the
Iowa
ABLE
29


plan,
a
first-time
homebuyer
savings
account,
and
an
individual
30


development
account.
The
bill
also
maintains
the
deductions
31


for
military
pension
income,
military
active
duty
pay,
social
32


security
retirement
benefits,
certain

received

The
bill
modifies
the
4


existing
deduction
for
health
insurance
payments
in
Code
5


section
422.7(29)
to
make
the
deduction
only
applicable
to
6


taxpayers
who
are
at
least
65
years
old
and
who
have
net
7


income
below
$100,000.
The
bill
also
modifies
the
existing
8


capital
gain
deduction
in
Code
section
422.7(21)
to
restrict
9


the
deduction
to
the
sale
of
real
property
used
in
farming
10


businesses
by
permitting
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
deduction
11


if
either
of
the
following
apply:
the
taxpayer
materially
12


participated
in
the
farming
business
for
at
least
10
years
and
13


held
the
real
property
for
at
least
10
years;
or
the
taxpayer
14


sold
the
real
property
to
a
relative.
The
bill
expands
the
15


definition
of
“relative”
to
include
an
entity
in
which
a
16


relative
of
the
taxpayer
has
a
legal
or
equitable
interest
in
17


the
entity
as
an
owner,
member,
partner,
or
beneficiary.
The
18


bill
provides
a
new
deduction
for
any
income
of
an
employee
19


resulting
from
the
payment
by
an
employer,
whether
paid
to
20


the
employee
or
a
lender,
of
principal
or
interest
on
the
21


employee’s
qualified
education
loan.
The
bill
also
modifies
22


the
calculation
of
net
income
for
purposes
of
the
alternate
23


tax
calculation
in
Code
section
422.5(3)
and
(3B),
and
the
tax
24


return
filing
thresholds
in
Code
section
422.13,
to
require
25


that
any
amount
of
itemized
deduction,
standard

26


personal
exemption
deduction,
or
qualified
business
income
27


deduction
that
was
allowed
in
computing
federal

income
28


shall
be
added
back.
29


CORPORATE
INCOME
TAX
AND
FRANCHISE
TAX
CALCULATION.
Under
30


current
law,
the
starting
point
for
calculating
the
corporate
31


income
tax
and
franchise
tax
is
federal
taxable
income
before

the

deduction,
because
net

Currently,

federal
16


child

credit
provided
in
section

Under

of
the
federal
20


child
and
dependent
care
credit
provided
in
section
21
of

Code
against

income
tax
if
the

is
less

The
bill
increases
the
income
threshold
determining
the

The
