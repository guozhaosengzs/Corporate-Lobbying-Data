EXPLANATION
2


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
3


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
4


Currently,
most
government
entities
must
use
a
competitive
5


bidding
process
for
a
construction
project
when
that
project
6


is
estimated
to
cost
at
least
as
much
as
a
threshold
defined
7


in
Code
section
26.3.
This
bill
allows
a
government
entity
to
8


use
an
alternative
project
delivery
contract
in
circumstances
9


that
normally
require
the
government
entity
to
use
competitive
10


bidding
procedures.
The
bill
defines
a
government
entity
to
11


include
the
state
board
of
regents.
12


The
bill
creates
two
types
of
alternative
project
delivery
13


contracts,
each
with
specified
requirements.
The
first
14


alternative
is
the
construction
manager-at-risk
contract.
If
a
15


government
entity
opts
to
use
a
construction
manager-at-risk
16


contract,
the
government
entity
shall
select
an
engineer
17


or
architect
to
prepare
the
construction
documents
for
18


the
project.
That
engineer
or
architect
cannot
serve
as
19


the
construction
manager-at-risk.
The
government
entity
20


shall
use
a
two-phase
process
in
selecting
the
construction
21


manager-at-risk.
The
first
phase
shall
include
a
request
for
22


qualifications
and
the
government
entity’s
selection
criteria.
23


The
government
entity
may
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
24


than
five
of
the
construction
managers-at-risk
who
submitted
25


qualifications
to
participate
in
the
second
phase,
based
solely
26


on
the
qualifications
of
those
construction
managers-at-risk.
27


In
phase
two,
the
construction
managers-at-risk
that
the
28


government
entity
selects
will
provide
additional
information,
29


including
the
project
proposal,
costs,
and
fees.
The
30


government
entity
shall
rank
the
construction
managers-at-risk
31


in
a
manner
in
which
qualifications
account
for
at
least
40
32


percent
of
the
evaluation
and
cost
accounts
for
no
more
than
60
33


percent
of
the
evaluation.
The
government
entity
shall
select
34


the
construction
manager-at-risk
that
offers
the
best
value

criteria.
If
the
two
parties
do
not
1


reach
an
agreement,
the
government
entity
shall
proceed
with
2


the
next
highest-ranked
construction
manager-at-risk
and
follow
3


this
process
until
the
government
entity
reaches
a
contract
4


with
a
construction
manager-at-risk.
The
selected
construction
5


manager-at-risk
shall
advertise
for
and
receive
sealed
bids
6


for
proposals
from
trade
contractors
or
subcontractors
and
7


publicly
review
those
bids
with
the
government
entity
in
a
8


manner
that
does
not
disclose
the
contents
of
the
bid
or
9


proposal
during
the
selection
process
to
a
person
not
employed
10


by
the
construction
manager-at-risk,
engineer,
architect,
or
11


government
entity
involved
with
the
project.
The
construction
12


manager-at-risk
will
select
a
bid
in
consultation
with
the
13


government
entity.
14


The
second
type
of
alternative
project
delivery
method
is
15


the
design-build
contract,
which
can
select
design-builders
in
16


either
a
three-phase
or
two-phase
process.
In
the
three-phase
17


process,
the
government
entity
shall
first
request
statements
18


of
qualifications
from
design-builders.
The
government
19


entity
shall
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
than
five
20


qualified
design-builders
to
move
on
to
phases
two
and
three.
21


In
the
second
phase,
the
government
entity
shall
solicit
22


technical
proposals
and
conceptual
designs
from
the
remaining
23


design-builders.
The
government
entity
shall
pay
a
stipend
24


to
any
design-builder
that
participates
in
phase
two
but
25


whose
contract
the
entity
does
not
select.
The
third
phase
26


involves
the
design-builders
submitting
construction
costs.
27


The
government
entity
shall
award
points
for
each
proposal.
If
28


the
government
entity
chooses
to
award
a
contract,
it
shall
29


award
the
contract
to
the
design-builder
with
the
highest
point
30


total.
31


If
the
government
entity
uses
the
two-phase
process,
the
32


government
entity
will
request
qualifications
and
include
33


its
selection
criteria.
The
