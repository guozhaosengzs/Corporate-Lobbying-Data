updates
language
in
Code
section
421.27
2


(penalties)
to
enhance
the
readability
of
the
Code
section.
3


The
bill
specifies
that
the

has
the
burden
to
prove
4


any
of
the
conditions
necessary
to
waive
a
penalty
under
Code
5

timely
file
a

return
are
in

provided

18


The
bill
specifies
that
a
taxpayer
who
is
required
to
file
a
19


quarterly
or
monthly
return
may
have
one
late
return
or
payment
20


over
a
three-year
period
before
being
ineligible
to
receive
a
21


waiver
of
a
penalty
for
failing
to
file
a
return.
22


Currently,
there
are
14
conditions
a

may
raise
23


in
order
to
be
eligible
to
receive
the
waiver
of
a
penalty
24


for
failing
to
file
a

these
25


conditions
relating
to
the
failure
to
file
an
inheritance
tax
26


return
that
resulted
from
a
disclaimer,
so
in
such
a
situation


27


the
penalty
is
not
waivable.
28


The
penalty
for
failing
to
timely
pay
tax
due
is
modified
by
29


the
bill
by
assessing
a
5
percent
penalty
against
the
unpaid
30


tax
due
rather
than
5

not
otherwise
required
to

14


tax

but

not
required
to,
collect

remit
the
use
16


tax
for
such
sales.
17


The
bill
strikes

revenue
biennially
submit
a

2


a
pass-through
entity
has
only
Iowa-source
income
from
the
3


pass-through
entity
and
a

4


relieves
the

of

disaster
11

and
any
amounts
in
excess
of
the
16


nonresident
member’s
Iowa
tax
liability
for
the
applicable
tax
17


period
may
be
refunded
to
the
nonresident
member.
18


The
bill
provides
that
a
tiered
pass-through
entity
is
19


subject
to
the
same
requirements
to
file
a
composite
return
and
20


pay
tax
on
the
distributive
shares
of
the
tiered
pass-through
21


entity’s
income.
The
bill
defines
a
tiered
pass-through
entity
22


to
mean
a
member
of
a
pass-through
entity
that
is
itself
a
23


pass-through
entity.
24


If
the
director
of

determines
it

entity
to
file
a
composite
return
for
nonresidents
27


other
than
nonresident
members
of
the
pass-through
entity.
28


The
bill
makes
the
due
date

the
pass-through
entity’s
regular
annual
tax
return
due
30


date.
31


The
bill
specifies
certain
circumstances
when
a
pass-
32


through
entity
is
not
required
to
remit
Iowa
income
or
33


franchise
tax
on
behalf
of
a
nonresident
member.
