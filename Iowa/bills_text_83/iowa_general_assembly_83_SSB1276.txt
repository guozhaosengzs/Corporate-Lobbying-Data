Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1161,
2


sections
99-132,
take
effect
January

2023.

Currently,
the
two
conditions
are
necessary
for
the
trigger
4


to
occur
include
net
general
fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
5


ending
June

2022,
equaling

104
percent
of
the
net
general

fund
revenues
for
the
fiscal
year
ending

If
8


these
two
conditions
are
not
satisfied,
current
law
institutes
9


the
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
the
January
1
10


following
the
first
fiscal
year
for
which
the
two
conditions
11


do
occur.
By
striking
the
“trigger”,
the
bill
sets
in
motion
12


numerous
tax
changes
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
13


January
1,
2023,
described
below.
14


INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAX.
The
tax
changes
include
reducing
the
15


number
of
individual
income
tax
brackets
from
nine
to
four,
and
16


modifying
the
taxable
income
amounts
and
tax
rates
as
follows:
17


Income
over:
But
not
over:
Tax
Rate:
18


1)
$0
$6,000
4.40%
19


2)
$6,000
$30,000
4.82%
20


3)
$30,000
$75,000
5.70%
21


4)
$75,000
6.50%
22


For
a
married
couple
filing
a
joint
return,
the
taxable
23


income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
are
doubled.
Also,
the
24


taxable
income
amounts
in
each
bracket
above
will
be
indexed
to
25


inflation
and
increased
in
future
tax
years,
beginning
in
the
26


tax
year
following
the
2023
tax
year.
27


INDIVIDUAL
INCOME
TAX
CALCULATION.
Under
current
law,
the
28


starting
point
for
computing
the
Iowa
individual
income
tax
is
29


federal
adjusted
gross
income
before
the
net
operating
loss
30


deduction,
which
is
generally
a
taxpayer’s
gross
income
minus
31


several
deductions.
From
that
point,
Iowa
requires
several
32


adjustments
and
then
provides
taxpayers
with
a
deduction
33


for
federal
income
taxes
paid,
and
the
option
to
deduct
a
34


standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions.
The
bill
changes
35

S.F.
_____


the
starting
point
for
computing
the
individual
income
tax
1


to
federal
taxable
income,
which
includes
all
deductions
and
2


adjustments
taken
at
the
federal
level
in
computing
tax,
3


including
a
standard
deduction
or
itemized
deductions,
and
the
4


qualified
business
income
deduction
allowed
for
certain
income
5


earned
from
a
pass-through
entity.
Because
the
starting
point
6


changes
to
federal
taxable
income,
and
federal
law
does
not
7


provide
for
the
filing
status
of
married
filing
separately
8


on
a
combined
return,
the
bill
repeals
that
filing
status
9


option
for
Iowa
tax
purposes.
Because
net
operating
loss
is
10


no
longer
calculated
at
the
state
level,
the
bill
requires
a
11


taxpayer
to
add
back
any
federal
net
operating
loss
deduction
12


carried
over
from
a
taxable
year
beginning
prior
to
the
2023
13


tax
year,
but
allows
taxpayers
to
deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net
14


operating
loss
from
a
prior
taxable
year.
The
bill
repeals
the
15


individual
alternative
minimum
tax
(AMT),
allows
an
individual
16


to
claim
any
remaining
AMT
credit
against
the
individual’s
17


regular
tax
liability
for
the
2023
tax
year,
and
then
repeals
18


the
AMT
credit
in
the
tax
year
following
the
2023
tax
year.
19


The
bill
repeals
most
Iowa-specific
deductions,
exemptions,
20


and
adjustments
currently
available
when
computing
net
income
21


and
taxable
income
under
Iowa
law,
including
the
Iowa
optional
22


standard
deduction
and
all
itemized
deductions,
and
the
ability
23


to
deduct
federal
income
taxes,
except
for
a
one-year
phase
24


out
in
the
2023
tax
year
for
taxes
paid,
or
refunds
received,
25


that
relate
to
a
prior
year.
The
bill
maintains
the
add-back
26


for
income
from
securities
that
are
federally
exempt
but
not
27


state-exempt,
and
for
bonus
depreciation
amounts.
The
bill
28


maintains
the
general
pension
exclusion
and
the
deduction
29


for
income
from
federal
securities.
The
bill
maintains
the


30


deduction
for
contributions
to
the
Iowa

plan,
the
Iowa
ABLE
31


plan,
a
first-time
homebuyer
savings
account,
and
an
individual
32


development
account.
The
bill
also
maintains
the
deductions

retirement
benefits,

The

modifies
the

in
Code

section
422.7(29)
to
make
the
deduction
only

taxpayers
who
are
at
least
65

old
and
who
have
net
9


income
below
$100,000.
The
bill
also
modifies
the
existing
10


capital
gain
deduction
in
Code
section
422.7(21)
to
restrict
11


the
deduction
to
the
sale
of
real
property
used
in
farming
12


businesses
by
permitting
the
taxpayer
to
take
the
deduction
13


if
either
of
the
following
apply:
the
taxpayer
materially
14


participated
in
the
farming
business
for
at
least
10
years
and
15


held
the
real
property
for
at
least
10
years;
or
the
taxpayer
16


sold
the
real
property
to
a
relative.
The
bill
expands
the
17


definition
of
“relative”
to
include
an
entity
in
which
a
18


relative
of
the
taxpayer
has
a
legal
or
equitable
interest
in
19


the
entity
as
an
owner,
member,
partner,
or
beneficiary.
The
20


bill
provides
a
new
deduction
for
any
income
of
an
employee
21


resulting
from
the
payment
by
an
employer,
whether
paid
to
22


the
employee
or
a
lender,
of
principal
or
interest
on
the
23


employee’s
qualified
education
loan.
The
bill
also
modifies
24


the
calculation
of
net
income
for
purposes
of
the
alternate
25


tax
calculation
in
Code
section
422.5(3)

and
the
tax
26


return

Code
section
422.13,

The
bill
repeals
the

As
a
2


result,
the
bill
requires
taxpayers

any
federal

net

deduction
carried
over
from
a
taxable
year
4


beginning
prior

but
allows
taxpayers
to

deduct
any
remaining
Iowa
net

The

when

Internal
Revenue
Code
against

if
the

income
is
less

$45,000.
Under
21


the

an
individual
may
claim
30
percent
of
the
federal
22


child
and
dependent
care
credit
provided
in
section
21
of

Internal
Revenue
Code
against
the
individual
income
tax
if
the
24


individual’s
net
income
is
less
than
$90,000.
25


The
bill
increases
the
income
threshold
determining
the
26


eligibility
of
a

for
the
early

whose
net
income
is
less
than
$45,000
per
year
to
29


less

By
increasing
the

31


now
eligible

DIVISION

——
BONUS
DEPRECIATION.
Currently,
when
a
6


business
buys
equipment
and
other
capital
assets,
the
business
7


is
allowed
to
deduct
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
such
property
8


as
depreciation
over
a
certain
period
for
federal
and
state
9


individual
or
corporate
income
tax
purposes.
Federal
taxpayers
10


are
allowed
to
immediately
deduct
a
higher
portion
of
the
cost
11


of
such
property
by
claiming
additional
first-year
depreciation
12


(bonus
depreciation).
Iowa
has
recently
adopted
“rolling
13


conformity”
with
federal
tax
law
but
did
not
conform
with
14


federal
bonus
depreciation
provisions,
meaning
a
taxpayer
15


deducts
the
cost
of
the
equipment
or
other
capital
assets
by
16


claiming
depreciation
over
a
longer
time
period
for
Iowa
income
17


tax
purposes.
The
bill
applies
retroactively
by
conforming
18


Iowa
tax
provisions
with
federal
bonus
depreciation
provisions
19


for
equipment
or
other
capital
assets
placed
in
service
on
or
20


after
January
1,
2021,
for
tax
years
beginning
on
or
after
21


that

By
conforming
with
federal
bonus
depreciation
22


provisions
for
tax
years
beginning
on

after
January
1,

23


Iowa
automatically
conforms

the
federal
limitation
on
24


business
interest
expense
deductions
in
Code
sections
422.7(60)
25


and
422.35(27).
Currently,
if
a

“bonus

Iowa
does
not
conform
with
the
federal
27


limitation

based
24


on
an
agreement
approved
by
the
authority
(amended
Code
25


section
16.81(6)).
It
also

——
PROPERTY
TAX
REPLACEMENT
PAYMENTS.
Current
11


Code
section
441.21A
establishes
and
appropriates
amounts
from
12


the
general
fund
of
the
state
for
commercial
and
industrial
13


property
tax
replacement
claims.
Such
claims
are
calculated
14


by
the
department
of
revenue
based
on
the
difference
between
15


the
actual
value
and
assessed
value
of
all
commercial
and
16


industrial
property
in
each
taxing
district
in
the
state.
17


Current
law
appropriates
an
amount
necessary
for
the
payment
18


of
all
commercial
and
industrial
property
tax
replacement
19


claims
for
each
fiscal
year
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
20


2014,
subject
to
a
maximum
total
appropriation
for
fiscal
21


years
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2017,
of
the
total
22


amount
necessary
for
the
payment
of
replacement
claims
in
the
23


fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2016.
The
bill
eliminates
the
24


appropriation
for
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
25


2029,
and
specifies
that
the
maximum
total
appropriation
for
26


the
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2022,
but
before
27


July
1,
2029,
shall
not
exceed
the
total
amount
necessary
for
28


the
payment
of
replacement
claims
in
the
fiscal
year.
29


The
bill
modifies
the
methodology
for
calculating
and
30


apportioning
commercial
and
industrial
property
tax
replacement
31


claims
for
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
July
1,
2022,
32


but
before
July
1,

The
bill
requires
such
claims
to
be
33


calculated
based
on
taxing
authorities,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
34


instead
of
taxing
districts
as
is
required
under
current
law.
