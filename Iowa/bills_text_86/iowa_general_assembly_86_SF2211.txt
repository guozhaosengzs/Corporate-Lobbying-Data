  5  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  4    This bill establishes the "Government Nondiscrimination
  5  5 Act" and provides definitions. The bill provides that
  5  6 notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the state shall not
  5  7 take any discriminatory or adverse action against a person,
  5  8 wholly or partially on the basis that such person believes,
  5  9 speaks, or acts in accordance with a sincerely held religious
  5 10 belief or moral conviction that evidences that marriage is or
  5 11 should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman; or
  5 12 that male and female refer to distinct and immutable biological
  5 13 sexes that are determinable by anatomy and genetics by the time
  5 14 of birth.
  5 15    The bill specifies what a discriminatory or adverse
  5 16 action means when taken by the state against such a person.
  5 17 Discriminatory or adverse actions include altering in any
  5 18 way the tax treatment of, or causing any tax, penalty,
  5 19 or payment to be assessed against, or denying, delaying,
  5 20 revoking, or otherwise making unavailable an exemption
  5 21 from taxation of such persons and provides for imputing
  5 22 federal determinations of tax treatment of a person when the
  5 23 state relies on such federal determinations; applying or
  5 24 causing to be applied, a fine, penalty, or payment assessed
  5 25 against such person; disallowing, denying, or otherwise
  5 26 making unavailable a deduction for state tax purposes of any
  5 27 charitable contribution made to or by such person; withholding,
  5 28 reducing, excluding, terminating, materially altering the
  5 29 terms or conditions of, or otherwise making unavailable or
  5 30 denying any state grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative
  5 31 agreement, guarantee, loan, scholarship, diploma, grade,
  5 32 recognition, license, certification, accreditation, employment,
  5 33 or other similar benefit, position, or status from or to such
  5 34 person; withholding, reducing, excluding, terminating, or
  5 35 otherwise making unavailable or denying any entitlement or
  6  1 benefit under a state benefit program as defined by the bill,
  6  2 including admission to, equal treatment in, or eligibility for
  6  3 a degree from an educational program, from or to such person;
  6  4 withholding, reducing, excluding, terminating, or otherwise
  6  5 making unavailable or denying access or an entitlement to state
  6  6 property, facilities, educational institutions, speaking forums
  6  7 whether traditional, limited, or nonpublic, or charitable
  6  8 fundraising campaigns from or to such person; and investigating
  6  9 or initiating an investigation, claim, or administrative
  6 10 proceeding of such person, if that person would not otherwise
  6 11 be subject to such action. Under the bill, the state is
  6 12 to consider accredited, licensed, or certified any person
  6 13 that would otherwise be accredited, licensed, or certified,
  6 14 respectively, for any purposes under state law but for a
  6 15 determination against such person wholly or partially on the
  6 16 basis that the person believes, speaks, or acts in accordance
  6 17 with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction as
  6 18 described in the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that a person may assert an actual or
  6 20 threatened violation of the bill as a cause of action in any
  6 21 judicial or administrative proceeding and obtain compensatory
  6 22 damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other
  6 23 appropriate relief. Standing to assert a claim or defense
  6 24 under the bill is governed by the general rules of standing
  6 25 under the laws of the state. Notwithstanding any provision of
  6 26 law to the contrary, an action under the bill may be commenced,
  6 27 and relief may be granted, in a court of the state without
  6 28 regard to whether the person commencing the action has sought
  6 29 or exhausted available administrative remedies. A prevailing
  6 30 party in an action under the new Code chapter who establishes
  6 31 a violation of the new Code chapter is entitled to recover
  6 32 reasonable attorney fees and costs. The office of the attorney
  6 33 general may also bring an action for injunctive or declaratory
  6 34 relief against the state to enforce compliance with the new
  6 35 Code chapter. The bill is not to be construed to deny, impair,
  7  1 or otherwise affect any right or authority of the office of the
  7  2 attorney general or the state, acting under any law other than
  7  3 the bill, to institute or intervene in any proceeding.
  7  4    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  7  5 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  7  6 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  7  7 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  7  8 States. The bill is not to be construed to prevent the state
  7  9 from providing any benefit or service authorized under state
  7 10 law. The bill is also not to be construed to authorize a
  7 11 medical provider, hospital, clinic, hospice program, or health
  7 12 care facility to deny visitation, to refuse to recognize
  7 13 an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney for
  7 14 health care pursuant to Code chapter 144B, or to refuse to
  7 15 provide life=saving or emergency medical treatment necessary
  7 16 to cure illness or disease. The protection of free exercise
  7 17 of religious beliefs and moral convictions afforded by the
  7 18 bill is in addition to the protections provided under federal
  7 19 law, state law, and the Constitutions of the State of Iowa
  7 20 and of the United States, and the bill is not to be construed
  7 21 to preempt or repeal any state or local law that is equally

  5  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  4    This bill establishes the "Government Nondiscrimination
  5  5 Act" and provides definitions. The bill provides that
  5  6 notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the state shall not
  5  7 take any discriminatory or adverse action against a person,
  5  8 wholly or partially on the basis that such person believes,
  5  9 speaks, or acts in accordance with a sincerely held religious
  5 10 belief or moral conviction that evidences that marriage is or
  5 11 should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman; or
  5 12 that male and female refer to distinct and immutable biological
  5 13 sexes that are determinable by anatomy and genetics by the time
  5 14 of birth.
  5 15    The bill specifies what a discriminatory or adverse
  5 16 action means when taken by the state against such a person.
  5 17 Discriminatory or adverse actions include altering in any
  5 18 way the tax treatment of, or causing any tax, penalty,
  5 19 or payment to be assessed against, or denying, delaying,
  5 20 revoking, or otherwise making unavailable an exemption
  5 21 from taxation of such persons and provides for imputing
  5 22 federal determinations of tax treatment of a person when the
  5 23 state relies on such federal determinations; applying or
  5 24 causing to be applied, a fine, penalty, or payment assessed
  5 25 against such person; disallowing, denying, or otherwise
  5 26 making unavailable a deduction for state tax purposes of any
  5 27 charitable contribution made to or by such person; withholding,
  5 28 reducing, excluding, terminating, materially altering the
  5 29 terms or conditions of, or otherwise making unavailable or
  5 30 denying any state grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative
  5 31 agreement, guarantee, loan, scholarship, diploma, grade,
  5 32 recognition, license, certification, accreditation, employment,
  5 33 or other similar benefit, position, or status from or to such
  5 34 person; withholding, reducing, excluding, terminating, or
  5 35 otherwise making unavailable or denying any entitlement or
  6  1 benefit under a state benefit program as defined by the bill,
  6  2 including admission to, equal treatment in, or eligibility for
  6  3 a degree from an educational program, from or to such person;
  6  4 withholding, reducing, excluding, terminating, or otherwise
  6  5 making unavailable or denying access or an entitlement to state
  6  6 property, facilities, educational institutions, speaking forums
  6  7 whether traditional, limited, or nonpublic, or charitable
  6  8 fundraising campaigns from or to such person; and investigating
  6  9 or initiating an investigation, claim, or administrative
  6 10 proceeding of such person, if that person would not otherwise
  6 11 be subject to such action. Under the bill, the state is
  6 12 to consider accredited, licensed, or certified any person
  6 13 that would otherwise be accredited, licensed, or certified,
  6 14 respectively, for any purposes under state law but for a
  6 15 determination against such person wholly or partially on the
  6 16 basis that the person believes, speaks, or acts in accordance
  6 17 with a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction as
  6 18 described in the bill.
  6 19    The bill provides that a person may assert an actual or
  6 20 threatened violation of the bill as a cause of action in any
  6 21 judicial or administrative proceeding and obtain compensatory
  6 22 damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, or any other
  6 23 appropriate relief. Standing to assert a claim or defense
  6 24 under the bill is governed by the general rules of standing
  6 25 under the laws of the state. Notwithstanding any provision of
  6 26 law to the contrary, an action under the bill may be commenced,
  6 27 and relief may be granted, in a court of the state without
  6 28 regard to whether the person commencing the action has sought
  6 29 or exhausted available administrative remedies. A prevailing
  6 30 party in an action under the new Code chapter who establishes
  6 31 a violation of the new Code chapter is entitled to recover
  6 32 reasonable attorney fees and costs. The office of the attorney
  6 33 general may also bring an action for injunctive or declaratory
  6 34 relief against the state to enforce compliance with the new
  6 35 Code chapter. The bill is not to be construed to deny, impair,
  7  1 or otherwise affect any right or authority of the office of the
  7  2 attorney general or the state, acting under any law other than
  7  3 the bill, to institute or intervene in any proceeding.
  7  4    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  7  5 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  7  6 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  7  7 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  7  8 States. The bill is not to be construed to prevent the state
  7  9 from providing any benefit or service authorized under state
  7 10 law. The bill is also not to be construed to authorize a
  7 11 medical provider, hospital, clinic, hospice program, or health
  7 12 care facility to deny visitation, to refuse to recognize
  7 13 an attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney for
  7 14 health care pursuant to Code chapter 144B, or to refuse to
  7 15 provide life=saving or emergency medical treatment necessary
  7 16 to cure illness or disease. The protection of free exercise
  7 17 of religious beliefs and moral convictions afforded by the
  7 18 bill is in addition to the protections provided under federal
  7 19 law, state law, and the Constitutions of the State of Iowa
  7 20 and of the United States, and the bill is not to be construed
  7 21 to preempt or repeal any state or local law that is equally
  7 22 or more protective of free exercise of religious beliefs or
  7 23 moral convictions or to narrow the meaning or application of
  7 24 any state or local law protecting free exercise of religious
  7 25 beliefs or moral convictions.
