  1 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 23    This bill modifies the criminal offense of accommodation.
  1 24    The bill provides that in a prosecution for unlawful
  1 25 delivery or possession with intent to deliver marijuana, if
  1 26 a defendant delivers or possesses with intent to deliver
  1 27 less than 42.5 grams of marijuana, the defendant is guilty
  1 28 of an accommodation offense rather than unlawful delivery or
  1 29 possession with intent to deliver marijuana under Code section
  1 30 124.401(1)(d).
  1 31    The bill effectively lowers the criminal penalty for
  1 32 unlawful delivery of or possession of with the intent to
  1 33 deliver certain amounts of marijuana by increasing the amount
  1 34 of marijuana that can be delivered or possessed with intent
  1 35 to deliver and prosecuted as an accommodation offense and by
  2  1 striking the requirement that the marijuana not be "offered for
  2  2 sale".
  2  3    Under current law, a defendant commits an accommodation
  2  4 offense when the defendant unlawfully delivers or possesses
  2  5 with intent to deliver one=half ounce or less of marijuana
  2  6 which was not offered for sale.
  2  7    Under the bill and in current law, if a defendant is found
  2  8 guilty of an accommodation offense, the defendant shall be
  2  9 sentenced as if the person were convicted of a violation of
  2 10 possessing marijuana under Code section 124.401(5).
  2 11    The bill lowers the criminal penalty from a class "D"
  2 12 felony to a serious misdemeanor for a defendant who unlawfully
  2 13 delivers or possesses with intent to deliver marijuana if the
  2 14 marijuana is not offered for sale and the amount of marijuana
  2 15 involved is less than 42.5 grams but more than one=half ounce.
  2 16 The criminal penalty remains the same for an accommodation
  2 17 offense involving one=half ounce or less of marijuana and the
  2 18 criminal penalty also remains the same for marijuana offenses
  2 19 involving 42.5 grams or greater amounts.
  2 20    A first violation for accommodation under Code section
  2 21 124.401(5) is a serious misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment
  2 22 in the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine
  2 23 of not more than $1,000, or by both. A second or subsequent
  2 24 conviction for an accommodation offense may be punished under
  2 25 Code section 124.411 by imprisonment for a period not to exceed
  2 26 three times the term otherwise authorized, or fined not more
  2 27 than three times the amount otherwise authorized, or punished
  2 28 by both imprisonment and fine.
