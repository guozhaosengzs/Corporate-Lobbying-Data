 17  9                           EXPLANATION
 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the

 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary

 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from

 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize

 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average

 17  9                           EXPLANATION
 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning

 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize

 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather

 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.

 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires

 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may

 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and

 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17  9                           EXPLANATION
 17 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 12    This bill relates to water quality by providing funding for
 17 13 water quality financial assistance programs, extending the
 17 14 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
 17 15 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, modifying
 17 16 and specifying uses for funding received from the secure an
 17 17 advanced vision for education fund, and modifying allocations
 17 18 of state sales and use tax revenue collections. The bill is
 17 19 organized by divisions.
 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities

 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the

 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from

 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends

 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which

 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable

 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is

 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created

 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the

 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average

 17 20    WATER QUALITY ==== FUNDING.  The bill creates a water quality
 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 21 financing review committee to review and approve applications
 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting

 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a

 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue

 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the

 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 17 22 for financial assistance under the water quality financing
 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install

 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public

 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 23 program and the wastewater and drinking water treatment
 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 24 financial assistance program.
 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 25    The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 17 26 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority.
 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 27 Currently, the program provides financial assistance to install
 17 28 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 17 29 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 17 30 and design. Awards of financial assistance are made by the
 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable

 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a

 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure

 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a

 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to

 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for

 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 31 authority. The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 17 32 and systems to the program and provides that the water quality
 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends

 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to

 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.

 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 17 33 financing review committee shall approve financial assistance.
 17 34 The bill adds reporting and review requirements to the program.
 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 17 35    The bill creates a water quality financing program to
 18  1 provide financial assistance in the form of loans, forgivable
 18  2 loans, and grants to enhance the quality of surface water and
 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends

 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to

 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may

 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 18  3 groundwater, particularly by providing financial assistance
 18  4 for projects designed to reduce the amount of contamination
 18  5 by addressing collaborative projects between point and
 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18  6 nonpoint sources.  The program is administered by the Iowa
 18  7 finance authority in cooperation with the department of
 18  8 natural resources and the department of agriculture and land
 18  9 stewardship.  The bill creates a water quality financing
 18 10 program fund administered by the authority to provide financial
 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a

 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for

 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to

 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to

 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.

 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 18 11 assistance under the program.  The bill allows the authority
 18 12 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 18 13 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Moneys in the water
 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which

 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may

 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18 14 quality financing program fund are not part of the general fund
 18 15 and are not included in determining the balance of the general
 18 16 fund of the state.  Under the program, an eligible entity is
 18 17 a municipality, as defined in the bill, a landowner, a public
 18 18 utility, a rural water district, or rural water association.
 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing

 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a
 18 20 plan for water quality improvement and financing and requires
 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure

 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest

 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure

 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon

 18 19 The bill provides certain application requirements regarding a

 18 21 loan recipients to enter into agreements with the authority for
 18 22 terms of the financial assistance.  The bill includes reporting
 18 23 and review requirements.
 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a

 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for

 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science

 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose

 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends

 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or

 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.

 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 18 24    The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure
 18 25 cost=share program to provide financial assistance on a
 18 26 cost=share basis to landowners for installing infrastructure
 18 27 projects designed to improve the water quality of the watershed
 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure

 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize

 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 18 28 in which the land is located.  In order to be eligible for
 18 29 financial assistance, a proposed project must be designed
 18 30 to reduce the transport of nutrients to water from nonpoint
 18 31 sources within watersheds in accordance with the latest
 18 32 revision of the document entitled "Iowa Nutrient Reduction
 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize

 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a

 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science

 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or

 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 18 33 Strategy" initially presented in November 2012 by the
 18 34 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 18 35 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 19  1 and technology.  The division of soil conservation and water
 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes
 19  8 reporting and review requirements.
 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for

 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 19  2 quality of the department of agriculture and land stewardship
 19  3 shall review proposed projects submitted by applicants,
 19  4 negotiate project details with applicants, and approve
 19  5 applications.  The bill creates a water quality infrastructure
 19  6 cost=share fund under the control of the division to provide
 19  7 financial assistance under the program.  The bill includes

 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per

 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 19  9    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
 19 10 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
 19 11 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the

 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water

 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of

 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 19 12 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
 19 13 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for

 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the

 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 19 14 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax
 19 15 is also subject to the use tax.  Following certain specified
 19 16 transfers, one=sixth of the remaining state sales tax revenue
 19 17 from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE fund created
 19 18 in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund are allocated
 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in
 19 21 Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales tax rate of 6
 19 22 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 2030, and Code
 19 23 chapter 423F, along with other corresponding provisions, is
 19 24 repealed December 31, 2029.
 19 25    The bill extends the imposition of the sales tax at the
 19 26 6 percent rate, the allocation to the SAVE fund, and the
 19 27 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
 19 28 The bill amends the legislative intent provision that describes
 19 29 the purpose of increasing the state sales tax from 5 to 6
 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 19 19 to school districts on a per pupil basis to be used for
 19 20 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes specified in

 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of

 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of

 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for

 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
 22 24 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
 22 25 tax levy.

 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to

 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a

 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or

 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may

 19 30 percent to include water quality efforts.
 19 31    The bill also divides the revenues currently transferred to
 19 32 the SAVE fund. Currently, after certain transfers are made,
 19 33 one=sixth of the remaining revenues are transferred to the SAVE
 19 34 fund.  Beginning July 1, 2016, the bill transfers an amount to
 19 35 the SAVE fund equal to the sum of the amount transferred to the
 20  1 SAVE fund for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, plus $10
 20  2 million.  Beginning July 1, 2017, the amount transferred to
 20  3 the SAVE fund increases each fiscal year by $10 million. Any
 20  4 moneys remaining from the one=sixth of the remaining revenues
 20  5 following the transfer to the SAVE fund are transferred to the
 20  6 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 20  7 fund, the water quality financing program fund, and the water
 20  8 quality infrastructure cost=share fund.  The wastewater and
 20  9 drinking water treatment financial assistance fund receives 15
 20 10 percent of the remainder, the water quality financing program
 20 11 fund receives 35 percent of the remainder, and the division
 20 12 of soil conservation and water quality receives 50 percent of
 20 13 the remainder for purposes of the water quality infrastructure
 20 14 cost=share program, assisting landowners with implementing
 20 15 water quality practices on a cost=share basis, and water
 20 16 quality demonstration projects.
 20 17    SAVE FUND PURPOSES AND REQUIREMENTS.  The bill establishes a
 20 18 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.  The board of
 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".
 21 10    Current Code section 423F.3 provides that a school district
 21 11 receiving revenues from the secure an advanced vision for
 21 12 education fund under Code chapter 423F without a valid revenue
 21 13 purpose statement shall expend the revenues for specified
 21 14 purposes in the order prescribed by law.  After required
 21 15 reductions of specified property tax levies, such a district
 21 16 may expend those revenues for authorized school infrastructure
 21 17 purposes specified by law.  The bill amends that provision to
 21 18 allow only those authorized school infrastructure purposes or
 21 19 projects the total cost of which is $1 million or less.
 21 20    Code chapter 423F provides that if the school board intends
 21 21 to use funds for purposes or projects other than for providing
 21 22 property tax relief by reducing indebtedness from the levies
 21 23 specified under Code section 298.2 or 298.18 or to change the
 21 24 use of funds to purposes or projects other than those purposes
 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which
 21 33 exceeds $1 million, the board shall adopt a revenue purpose
 21 34 statement or amend an existing revenue purpose statement,
 21 35 subject to approval of the electors, to specifically authorize
 22  1 the use of funds for that school infrastructure purpose or
 22  2 project. The bill also requires both the ballot presented to
 22  3 the electors and the revenue purpose statement to describe each
 22  4 school infrastructure purpose or project that has a total cost
 22  5 exceeding $1 million, specify the estimated commencement and
 22  6 completion dates for each such purpose or project, and specify
 22  7 a maximum amount of funds received from the SAVE fund that may
 22  8 be used for each such purpose or project.
 22  9    The bill also provides that if the proposed revenue purpose
 22 10 statement or proposed amendment to an existing revenue
 22 11 purpose statement authorizes the use of funds for a school
 22 12 infrastructure purpose or project the cost of which exceeds $1
 22 13 million, 60 percent of those voting on the question, rather
 22 14 than a simple majority, must vote in favor of approval.
 22 15    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
 22 16 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
 22 17 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
 22 18 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
 22 19 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
 22 20 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
 22 21 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
 22 22 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
 22 23 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for

 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of
 20 26 the resolution and the amount of the budget adjustment to be
 20 27 received.
 20 28    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
 20 29 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
 20 30 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
 20 31 between the school district's regular program district cost
 20 32 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
 20 33 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
 20 34 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
 20 35 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
 21  4 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
 21  5 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
 21  6 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
 21  7 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
 21  8 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
 21  9 "instructional expenditures".

 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
 21 28 purpose statement may be amended to provide for such a change
 21 29 in the use of funds, subject to voter approval.
 21 30    Under the bill, if the school board intends to use funds for
 21 31 a school infrastructure purpose or project that was approved
 21 32 by the board on or after July 1, 2016, the total cost of which

 20 19 directors of a school district with a regular program district
 20 20 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
 20 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
 20 22 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
 20 23 to receive the budget adjustment authorized in the bill.
 20 24 Following adoption of the resolution the board of directors
 20 25 must notify the department of management of the adoption of

 21  1 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
 21  2 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
 21  3 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for

 21 25 or projects, the board must adopt a revenue purpose statement,
 21 26 subject to approval of the electors, listing the proposed use
 21 27 of the funds. The bill specifies that an existing revenue
