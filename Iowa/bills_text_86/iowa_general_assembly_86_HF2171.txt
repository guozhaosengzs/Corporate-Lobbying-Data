  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill modifies the penalties and the accumulation of
  5  6 earned time for inmates incarcerated for the commission of
  5  7 certain felonies which require the inmates to serve at least 70
  5  8 percent of the maximum terms of the applicable sentences.
  5  9    The bill modifies the 70 percent sentence requirement under
  5 10 Code section 902.12 to a 30 percent sentence requirement for
  5 11 an offense committed on or after July 1, 2016. The bill does
  5 12 not affect 70 percent sentences committed prior to July 1,
  5 13 2016. However, the bill amends 70 percent sentence provisions
  5 14 in newly designated Code section 902.12(1) in the bill, in
  5 15 order to reflect similar language in the 30 percent sentence
  5 16 provisions created in new Code section 902.12(2) in the bill.
  5 17    The bill allows a person convicted of the following offenses
  5 18 if such offense is committed on or after July 1, 2016, to
  5 19 be eligible for consideration for parol or work release
  5 20 after serving at least 30 percent of the maximum term of the
  5 21 sentence: murder in the second degree in violation of Code
  5 22 section 707.3; attempted murder in violation of Code section
  5 23 707.11; sexual abuse in the second degree in violation of Code
  5 24 section 709.3; kidnapping in the second degree in violation of
  5 25 Code section 710.3; robbery in the first or second degree in
  5 26 violation of Code section 711.2 or 711.3; or vehicular homicide
  5 27 in violation of Code section 707.6A(1) or (2), if the person
  5 28 was also convicted under Code section 321.261(4), based on the
  5 29 same facts or event that resulted in the conviction under Code
  5 30 section 707.6A(1) or (2).
  5 31    The bill specifies that the board of parole, when
  5 32 evaluating an inmate for parole or work release for an
  5 33 offense committed under Code section 902.12 (both 70 percent
  5 34 sentences and 30 percent sentences), shall consider any
  5 35 factors it finds relevant including but not limited to the
  6  1 following factors: previous criminal record, nature and
  6  2 circumstances of the felony offense, recidivism, convictions
  6  3 or behavior indicating propensity for violence, participation
  6  4 in institutional programs, including academic and vocational
  6  5 training, psychiatric and psychological evaluations, length
  6  6 of time served, evidence of serious or habitual institutional
  6  7 misconduct, success or failure while on probation, prior parole
  6  8 or work release history, prior refusal to accept parole or
  6  9 work release, history of drug or alcohol abuse, a parole plan
  6 10 formulated by the inmate, general attitude and behavior while
  6 11 incarcerated, and a validated risk assessment that includes
  6 12 a risk categorization taken from a model approved by the
  6 13 department of corrections.
  6 14    The bill specifies that the board of parole should request a
  6 15 complete psychiatric or psychological evaluation of an inmate
  6 16 serving a sentence under Code section 902.12 if, in the opinion
  6 17 of the board of parole, the evaluation would be beneficial to
  6 18 the decision of the board.
  6 19    The bill creates a category "C" sentence for the accrual of
  6 20 earned time by eliminating the ability of a person sentenced
  6 21 to a 30 percent sentence under the bill to accumulate earned
  6 22 time for the commission of an offense on or after July 1,
  6 23 2016.  Current law allows a person serving a 70 percent
  6 24 sentence to be eligible for a reduction of sentence equal to
  6 25 fifteen eighty=fifths of a day for each day of good conduct
  6 26 by the inmate up to a maximum amount of earned time of 15
  6 27 percent of the total sentence of confinement under Code section
  6 28 903A.2(1)(b).
  6 29    Under the bill, if a person is sentenced to serve both
  6 30 a category "C" sentence and another category sentence, the
  6 31 category "C" sentence shall be served before the other category
  6 32 sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue until the
  6 33 category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also provides
  6 34 that if an inmate serving another category sentence besides
  6 35 a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category "C"
  7  1 sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall be
  7  2 interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
  7  3 that sentence until the category "C" sentence is completed.
  7  4    A person who is serving a sentence under the bill which
  7  5 exceeds 10 years and who is released on parole or work release
  7  6 shall reside in a residential facility operated by the district
  7  7 department for a period of not less than one year.
