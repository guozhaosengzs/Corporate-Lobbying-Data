  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS.  The general assembly finds all of the
  1  2 following:
  1  3    1.  Nonprofit organizations provide a vital role in society
  1  4 by focusing resources and providing important services to meet
  1  5 community needs without regard to profit, and the United States
  1  6 and Iowa support and recognize these nonprofit organizations in
  1  7 part by providing important and necessary tax benefits.
  1  8    2.  The United States and Iowa have a long, honorable history
  1  9 of accommodating religious exercise and establishing conscience
  1 10 protections based on religious and moral convictions.
  1 11    3.  Protecting the tax benefits available to nonprofit
  1 12 organizations from being denied based on religious or moral
  1 13 convictions is a state interest of the highest order.  The
  1 14 state is obligated to take measures that advance this interest
  1 15 by remedying, deterring, and preventing government interference
  1 16 with religious exercise in a way that complements the
  1 17 protections mandated by the Constitution of the State of Iowa
  1 18 and the Constitution of the United States.
  1 19    4.  In 2015, during the course of oral argument at the United
  1 20 States Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct.
  1 21 2584 (2015), when Justice Alito asked whether an institution
  1 22 could lose its tax=exempt status for maintaining the view that
  1 23 marriage is the union of one man and one woman, the solicitor
  1 24 general of the United States admitted it was "going to be an
  1 25 issue".
  1 26    5.  In the Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, the United States
  1 27 Supreme Court held same=sex couples have a right to marry, but
  1 28 also noted, "Many who deem same=sex marriage to be wrong reach
  1 29 that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or
  1 30 philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are
  1 31 disparaged here".
  1 32    6.  In the wake of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, leading
  1 33 legal scholars concur that conflict between same=sex marriage
  1 34 and religious liberty are inevitable and, therefore, should be
  1 35 addressed through legislation.
  2  1    7.  The state of Iowa has an obligation to refrain from
  2  2 discriminating against those who maintain a belief that
  2  3 marriage is the union of one man and one woman based on
  2  4 religious and moral convictions.
  2  5    8.  Laws that protect important and necessary tax benefits
  2  6 from being denied because of the free exercise of religious
  2  7 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage
  2  8 private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for
  2  9 those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a
  2 10 more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.

  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS.  The general assembly finds all of the
  1  2 following:
  1  3    1.  Nonprofit organizations provide a vital role in society
  1  4 by focusing resources and providing important services to meet
  1  5 community needs without regard to profit, and the United States
  1  6 and Iowa support and recognize these nonprofit organizations in
  1  7 part by providing important and necessary tax benefits.
  1  8    2.  The United States and Iowa have a long, honorable history
  1  9 of accommodating religious exercise and establishing conscience
  1 10 protections based on religious and moral convictions.
  1 11    3.  Protecting the tax benefits available to nonprofit
  1 12 organizations from being denied based on religious or moral
  1 13 convictions is a state interest of the highest order.  The
  1 14 state is obligated to take measures that advance this interest
  1 15 by remedying, deterring, and preventing government interference
  1 16 with religious exercise in a way that complements the
  1 17 protections mandated by the Constitution of the State of Iowa
  1 18 and the Constitution of the United States.
  1 19    4.  In 2015, during the course of oral argument at the United
  1 20 States Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct.
  1 21 2584 (2015), when Justice Alito asked whether an institution
  1 22 could lose its tax=exempt status for maintaining the view that
  1 23 marriage is the union of one man and one woman, the solicitor
  1 24 general of the United States admitted it was "going to be an
  1 25 issue".
  1 26    5.  In the Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, the United States
  1 27 Supreme Court held same=sex couples have a right to marry, but
  1 28 also noted, "Many who deem same=sex marriage to be wrong reach
  1 29 that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or
  1 30 philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are
  1 31 disparaged here".
  1 32    6.  In the wake of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, leading
  1 33 legal scholars concur that conflict between same=sex marriage
  1 34 and religious liberty are inevitable and, therefore, should be
  1 35 addressed through legislation.
  2  1    7.  The state of Iowa has an obligation to refrain from
  2  2 discriminating against those who maintain a belief that
  2  3 marriage is the union of one man and one woman based on
  2  4 religious and moral convictions.
  2  5    8.  Laws that protect important and necessary tax benefits
  2  6 from being denied because of the free exercise of religious
  2  7 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage
  2  8 private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for
  2  9 those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a
  2 10 more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.

  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,

  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain

  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  6 30    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes

  5  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  7    This bill protects tax benefits of nonprofit organizations
  5  8 from being disallowed because of certain religious beliefs
  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,
  5 10 including but not limited to findings related to the state
  5 11 interest in protecting tax benefits of nonprofit organizations,
  5 12 and in protecting and promoting the free exercise of religious
  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  5 34 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  5 35 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6  1 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6  2 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition

  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the

  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization

  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the

  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to

  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,
  5 10 including but not limited to findings related to the state

  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an

  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.

  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an

  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  5 34 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  5 35 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax

  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any

  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several

  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting

  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain

  5  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  7    This bill protects tax benefits of nonprofit organizations
  5  8 from being disallowed because of certain religious beliefs
  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,
  5 10 including but not limited to findings related to the state
  5 11 interest in protecting tax benefits of nonprofit organizations,
  5 12 and in protecting and promoting the free exercise of religious
  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several

  6  1 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6  2 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6  3 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6  4 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  6 30    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  6 31 effect upon enactment.

  5  4                           EXPLANATION
  5  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  7    This bill protects tax benefits of nonprofit organizations
  5  8 from being disallowed because of certain religious beliefs
  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,
  5 10 including but not limited to findings related to the state
  5 11 interest in protecting tax benefits of nonprofit organizations,
  5 12 and in protecting and promoting the free exercise of religious
  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  5 34 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  5 35 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6  1 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6  2 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6  3 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6  4 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  6 30    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  6 31 effect upon enactment.

  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to

  5  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  7    This bill protects tax benefits of nonprofit organizations
  5  8 from being disallowed because of certain religious beliefs
  5  9 and moral convictions.  The bill also makes several findings,
  5 10 including but not limited to findings related to the state
  5 11 interest in protecting tax benefits of nonprofit organizations,
  5 12 and in protecting and promoting the free exercise of religious
  5 13 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.
  5 14    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 15 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 16 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, an
  5 17 organization that is recognized as nonprofit, or exempt from
  5 18 federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) {501(a),
  5 19 such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after the
  5 20 effective date of the bill because the organization believes,
  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization
  5 25 was disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis
  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
  5 28    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  5 29 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  5 30 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  5 31 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  5 32    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  5 33 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  5 34 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  5 35 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6  1 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6  2 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6  3 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6  4 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6  5 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6  6 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6  7 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6  8 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6  9 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 10 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and
  6 15 corporate income tax and franchise tax, and shall be considered
  6 16 exempt under the inheritance tax.
  6 17    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 18 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 19 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 20 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 21 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 22 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 23 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 24 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 25 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  6 26 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  6 27 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  6 28 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  6 29 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  6 30    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  6 31 effect upon enactment.

  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization

  6 11 the fact that the recipient or beneficiary of the property was
  6 12 disallowed a tax exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing,
  6 13 acting, or teaching in a way described in the bill, shall be
  6 14 considered deductible contributions under the individual and

  5 21 acts, or teaches in accordance with a religious belief or moral
  5 22 conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the
  5 23 union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are
  5 24 properly reserved to such marriage, or because the organization

  5 26 of those beliefs, acts, or teachings.  "Tax benefit" is defined
  5 27 in the bill.
