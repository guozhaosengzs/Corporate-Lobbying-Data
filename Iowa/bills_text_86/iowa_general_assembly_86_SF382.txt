  1 10 seq., as amended by the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of
  1 11 1990, Pub. L. No. 101=549, including those amendments effective
  1 12 on January 1, 1991, regulations promulgated by the United
  1 13 States environmental protection agency pursuant to that Act,
  1 14 the provisions of this chapter, and rules adopted by the
  1 15 commission pursuant to this chapter.
  1 16    2.  The commission shall adopt by rule a process for
  1 17 establishing air quality fees which shall be imposed and
  1 18 collected by the department.  The fees shall be credited to an
  1 19 air quality fund which is created in the state treasury under
  1 20 the management and control of the department.  The fund may
  1 21 include any other moneys appropriated by the general assembly
  1 22 or otherwise available to and obtained or accepted by the
  1 23 department for deposit in the fund.
  1 24    3.  The moneys in the fund are appropriated to the department
  1 25 and shall be used exclusively to carry out the provisions of
  1 26 this section pursuant to rules adopted by the commission,
  1 27 and shall not require further special authorization by the
  1 28 general assembly.  The fund shall be composed of a major source
  1 29 account, a minor source account, and an asbestos account as
  1 30 created in this section.
  1 31    4.  a.  The major source account shall include all fees

  2  5 implement new source review programs as described in paragraph
  2  6 "a", including costs associated with a new, modified, or
  2  7 existing major source and related control equipment.
  2  8    5.  a.  The minor source account shall include all fees
  2  9 collected by the department for accepting applications
  2 10 submitted by minor air contaminant sources for  construction
  2 11 permits or for providing for registrations, permits by rule,
  2 12 or template permits in lieu of obtaining construction permits,
  2 13 under minor source new source review programs pursuant to the
  2 14 federal Clean Air Act, including as provided under 567 IAC ch.

  2 30    7.  Each fiscal year, the commission shall as necessary
  2 31 adjust the air quality fees to be credited to each account
  2 32 of the air quality fund. The amount of each fee shall be
  2 33 determined after considering the estimated amount required to
  2 34 support each program financed by that account after subtracting
  2 35 the expected unencumbered and unobligated balance in that
  3  1 account at the end of a fiscal year.
  3  2    8.  a.  The department shall not transfer moneys credited

  3 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 13    This bill provides that the environmental protection
  3 14 commission must adopt rules that establish a process that
  3 15 allows the commission to annually set air quality fees
  3 16 to be imposed and collected by the department of natural
  3 17 resources.  The bill creates an air quality fund under the
  3 18 control of the department. The bill divides the fund into
  3 19 three separate accounts, each financed by different air quality
  3 20 fees associated with a federal program under the federal
  3 21 Clean Air Act, with each account to be used to support that
  3 22 federal program.  The accounts include:  (1) a major source
  3 23 account which must be used to regulate major air contaminant
  3 24 sources under new source review programs, (2) a minor source
  3 25 account which must be used to regulate minor air contaminant
  3 26 sources or for providing alternatives for constructions permits
  3 27 under minor source new source review programs, and (3)  an
  3 28 asbestos account which must be used to pay for regulating
  3 29 the asbestos national emission standard for hazardous air
  3 30 pollutants program. The bill requires the commission to as
  3 31 necessary adjust the air quality fees required to be credited
  3 32 to the three accounts before the end of each fiscal year.  The
  3 33 department is prohibited from transferring moneys between
  3 34 accounts. The fund retains interest or earnings on moneys in
  3 35 the fund, and moneys credited to the fund do not revert to any
  4  1 other source.

  3 20 fees associated with a federal program under the federal
  3 21 Clean Air Act, with each account to be used to support that
  3 22 federal program.  The accounts include:  (1) a major source
  3 23 account which must be used to regulate major air contaminant
  3 24 sources under new source review programs, (2) a minor source
  3 25 account which must be used to regulate minor air contaminant
  3 26 sources or for providing alternatives for constructions permits
  3 27 under minor source new source review programs, and (3)  an
  3 28 asbestos account which must be used to pay for regulating
  3 29 the asbestos national emission standard for hazardous air
  3 30 pollutants program. The bill requires the commission to as
  3 31 necessary adjust the air quality fees required to be credited
  3 32 to the three accounts before the end of each fiscal year.  The
  3 33 department is prohibited from transferring moneys between
  3 34 accounts. The fund retains interest or earnings on moneys in
  3 35 the fund, and moneys credited to the fund do not revert to any
  4  1 other source.

  3 18 control of the department. The bill divides the fund into
  3 19 three separate accounts, each financed by different air quality
  3 20 fees associated with a federal program under the federal
  3 21 Clean Air Act, with each account to be used to support that
  3 22 federal program.  The accounts include:  (1) a major source
  3 23 account which must be used to regulate major air contaminant
  3 24 sources under new source review programs, (2) a minor source
  3 25 account which must be used to regulate minor air contaminant
  3 26 sources or for providing alternatives for constructions permits
  3 27 under minor source new source review programs, and (3)  an
  3 28 asbestos account which must be used to pay for regulating
  3 29 the asbestos national emission standard for hazardous air
  3 30 pollutants program. The bill requires the commission to as
  3 31 necessary adjust the air quality fees required to be credited
  3 32 to the three accounts before the end of each fiscal year.  The
  3 33 department is prohibited from transferring moneys between
  3 34 accounts. The fund retains interest or earnings on moneys in

  3 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 13    This bill provides that the environmental protection
  3 14 commission must adopt rules that establish a process that
  3 15 allows the commission to annually set air quality fees
  3 16 to be imposed and collected by the department of natural
  3 17 resources.  The bill creates an air quality fund under the
  3 18 control of the department. The bill divides the fund into
  3 19 three separate accounts, each financed by different air quality
  3 20 fees associated with a federal program under the federal
  3 21 Clean Air Act, with each account to be used to support that
  3 22 federal program.  The accounts include:  (1) a major source
  3 23 account which must be used to regulate major air contaminant
  3 24 sources under new source review programs, (2) a minor source
  3 25 account which must be used to regulate minor air contaminant
  3 26 sources or for providing alternatives for constructions permits
  3 27 under minor source new source review programs, and (3)  an
  3 28 asbestos account which must be used to pay for regulating
  3 29 the asbestos national emission standard for hazardous air
  3 30 pollutants program. The bill requires the commission to as
  3 31 necessary adjust the air quality fees required to be credited
  3 32 to the three accounts before the end of each fiscal year.  The
  3 33 department is prohibited from transferring moneys between
  3 34 accounts. The fund retains interest or earnings on moneys in
  3 35 the fund, and moneys credited to the fund do not revert to any
  4  1 other source.
