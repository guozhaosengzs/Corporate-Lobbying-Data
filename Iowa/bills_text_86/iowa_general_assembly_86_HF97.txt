  1  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  7    Current law requires the state board of education to adopt
  1  8 rules for online learning, including rules prohibiting the
  1  9 open enrollment of students whose educational instruction and
  1 10 course content are delivered primarily over the internet. An
  1 11 exception to that prohibition requires the board to adopt rules
  1 12 allowing such enrollment, with limitations on how many students
  1 13 may be enrolled statewide and per school district. The
  1 14 exception also limits such open enrollment to the CAM community
  1 15 school district or the Clayton Ridge community school district
  1 16 until June 30, 2015. This exception to the prohibition of open
  1 17 enrollment in online learning is repealed by its own terms July
  1 18 1, 2015.
  1 19    This bill strikes the repeal, allowing the exception to
  1 20 remain in effect, but only as to the limitation relating to the
  1 21 number of online learning students open enrolled statewide and
  1 22 per school district.
