  2 11                           EXPLANATION
  2 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 14    This bill relates to the certification and regulation of
  2 15 shorthand reporters (court reporters).
  2 16    Current law provides that a shorthand reporter shall
  2 17 not engage in the profession of shorthand reporting unless
  2 18 the person is certified. The bill expands the criteria for
  2 19 obtaining such a certification.  Under the bill, the board
  2 20 of examiners of shorthand reporters may issue a certificate
  2 21 to a person of good moral character and fitness who makes
  2 22 application on a form prescribed and furnished by the board
  2 23 and who satisfies the education, experience, examination
  2 24 requirements, and rules prescribed by the supreme court.  The
  2 25 bill specifies that the board may consider the applicant's
  2 26 past record of any felony conviction and the applicant's past
