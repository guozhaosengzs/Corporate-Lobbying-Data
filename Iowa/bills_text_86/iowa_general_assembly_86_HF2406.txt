 26 31 designating a term of four years for members of a board of
 26 32 directors of a merged area, the term of office for a seat on a
 26 33 board of directors filled at the regular school election held
 26 34 on:
 26 35    a.  September 10, 2013, shall expire November 7, 2017.
 27  1    b.  September 8, 2015, shall expire November 5, 2019.

 27 16                           EXPLANATION
 27 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 27 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 27 19    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 27 20 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 27 21 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 27 22 school elections.
 27 23    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 27 24 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school
 27 35 elections held on or after November 7, 2017. Under the bill,
 28  1 the regular school elections previously scheduled to be held
 28  2 in September 2017 shall be held in November 2017 and those
 28  3 elections previously scheduled to be held in September 2019
 28  4 shall be held in November 2019.
 28  5    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing
 28  7 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 28  8 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 28  9 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 28 10 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 28 15 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 28 16 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 28 26 the election.
 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 29 22 related to the current terms of office for seats on boards
 29 23 of directors for school districts, merged areas, and area
 29 24 education agencies.

 27 24 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school

 28 16 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before

 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political

 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related

 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 28 26 the election.
 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions

 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school

 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing

 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before

 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for

 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.

 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special

 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before

 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for

 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the

 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days

 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.

 29 23 of directors for school districts, merged areas, and area

 27 19    This bill changes the date of regular school elections

 27 24 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.

 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing

 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special

 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time

 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for

 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor

 27 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 27 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 27 19    This bill changes the date of regular school elections
 27 20 for local school districts, merged areas, and area education
 27 21 agencies and provides for combined administration of city and
 27 22 school elections.
 27 23    Division I of the bill moves the date of the regular school
 27 24 election from the second Tuesday in September in odd=numbered
 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school
 27 35 elections held on or after November 7, 2017. Under the bill,
 28  1 the regular school elections previously scheduled to be held
 28  2 in September 2017 shall be held in November 2017 and those
 28  3 elections previously scheduled to be held in September 2019
 28  4 shall be held in November 2019.
 28  5    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing
 28  7 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 28  8 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 28  9 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 28 10 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special

 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 28 26 the election.
 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the

 28  8 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 28  9 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 28 10 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 28 15 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can
 28 16 not be scheduled to coincide with the general election.
 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 28 26 the election.
 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 29 22 related to the current terms of office for seats on boards
 29 23 of directors for school districts, merged areas, and area

 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.

 28 17    For the regular school election, the division changes the
 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before

 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on

 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special

 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for

 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor

 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of

 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school

 28  5    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing
 28  7 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 28  8 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a

 28 10 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special

 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days

 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions
 29 22 related to the current terms of office for seats on boards
 29 23 of directors for school districts, merged areas, and area

 27 19    This bill changes the date of regular school elections

 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school
 27 35 elections held on or after November 7, 2017. Under the bill,
 28  1 the regular school elections previously scheduled to be held
 28  2 in September 2017 shall be held in November 2017 and those

 28  5    Division II of the bill provides for the combined
 28  6 administration of city and school elections by changing
 28  7 certain school filing, withdrawal, and objection deadlines
 28  8 to mirror those of city elections. Under the division, a
 28  9 county commissioner of elections (county auditor) is required,
 28 10 whenever practicable, to designate polling places so that
 28 11 eligible voters will be assigned to the same polling place for
 28 12 general elections, city elections, and school elections. Under
 28 13 the division, polling hours for city and school elections will
 28 14 be from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Under the division, special
 28 15 elections for cities, school districts, and merged areas can

 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before
 28 26 the election.
 28 27    Under current law, when a political subdivision is located
 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for
 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions

 27 25 years to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 27 26 of odd=numbered years, which is also the date of the regular
 27 27 city election. Because area education agency boards of
 27 28 directors are elected at the director district conventions by
 27 29 members of school boards, the division also changes the date
 27 30 of their election from September to November. The division
 27 31 also makes the dates of school district and merged area special
 27 32 elections the same as the dates for special elections for
 27 33 cities in division II of the bill.
 27 34    Division I takes effect July 1, 2017, and applies to school

 28 18 time period for filing nomination papers with the secretary
 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before
 28 22 the election.   In addition, for school elections, the deadline
 28 23 for filing a withdrawal of candidacy is changed from 35 days
 28 24 to 42 days, and the deadline for filling a nomination vacancy
 28 25 at convention or caucus is changed from 35 to 42 days before

 28 28 in more than one county, the county commissioner of elections
 28 29 of the county having the greatest taxable base within the
 28 30 political subdivision is required to conduct elections for

 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related
 29  8 to the administration and conduct of canvasses and recounts for
 29  9 regular and special city and school elections and city runoff
 29 10 elections.
 29 11    Under the division, certain duties of the county auditor
 29 12 related to city elections are transferred to the city clerk.
 29 13 The division also establishes an order for the appearance on
 29 14 the ballot of political subdivision offices and ballot measures
 29 15 and requires the drawing of lots for placement of names on
 29 16 ballots for city and school elections. Under current law,  the
 29 17 names of such candidates are subject to rotation on ballots by
 29 18 precinct. The division also specifies that a candidate's name
 29 19 may appear on the ballot for both school and city office in the
 29 20 same election. Division II takes effect July 1, 2017.
 29 21    Division III of the bill includes transition provisions

 28 19 of the school board to not more than 71 days nor less than 47
 28 20 days before the election.  Under current law, the filing time
 28 21 period is not more than 64 days nor less than 40 days before

 28 31 the political subdivision. Under the division, the county
 28 32 commissioners of each of the counties where the political
 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
 29  1 election functions for those political subdivisions located
 29  2 in more than one county. The designation of a controlling
 29  3 county commissioner is based on the taxable base within the
 29  4 political subdivision. Under the division, the controlling
 29  5 commissioner is required to conduct a second canvass of city
 29  6 and school elections for political subdivisions located in more
 29  7 than one county. The division makes additional changes related

 28 33 subdivision is located are required to conduct the election
 28 34 in the commissioner's county, but the division provides that
 28 35 a controlling county commissioner be responsible for certain
