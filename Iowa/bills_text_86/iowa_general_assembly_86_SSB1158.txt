EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
affects
public
construction
projects
set
for
4


bidding
by
educational
institutions.
5


Currently,
the
state
board
of
regents
is
exempted
from
Code
6


chapter
26,
the
Iowa
Construction
Bidding
Procedures
Act,
7


through
a
specific
exemption
in
the
chapter’s
definition
of
8


“governmental
entity”.
The
bill
eliminates
this
exemption,
9


thus
requiring
the
state
board
of
regents
to
comply
with
the
10


requirements
established
by
the
Code
chapter.
11


Currently,
when
a
governmental
entity
seeks
separate
bids
12


for
parts
of
a
public
improvement
project,
general
contractors
13


may
be
prohibited
from
submitting
bids
for
the
project
as
a
14


whole.
The
bill
requires
general
contractors
to
be
allowed
15


to
submit
bids
for
an
entire
project
in
instances
where
the
16


state
board
of
regents
or
a
public
school
corporation,
such
17


as
an
area
education
agency,
a
community
college,
or
a
school
18


district,
has
decided
to
accept
bids
for
separate
parts
of
the
19


public
improvement
project.
20


The
bill
defines
“construction
manager”,
”educational
21


institution”,
general
contractor”,
and
“public
school
22


corporation”.
