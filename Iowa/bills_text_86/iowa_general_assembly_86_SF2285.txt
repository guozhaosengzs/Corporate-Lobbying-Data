 10  4                           EXPLANATION
 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 13 23 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 13 24 or after January 1, 2017.

 10  4                           EXPLANATION
 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures

 10  4                           EXPLANATION
 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the

 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the

 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has

 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount

 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures

 10  4                           EXPLANATION
 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities

 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering

 10  4                           EXPLANATION
 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering

 10  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  7    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 10  8 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 10  9 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 10 10 production tax credit program.
 10 11    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 10 12 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 10 13 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 10 14 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 10 15 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 10 24 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 10 25 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 10 26 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 13 23 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

 10 27 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 13 23 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 13 24 or after January 1, 2017.

 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 13 23 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

 10 16 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 10 17 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This

 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession

 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA

 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by

 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.

 10 28 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 10 29 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 13 23 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

 10 18 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 10 19 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 10 20 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 10 21    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 10 22 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 10 23 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,

 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's

 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An

 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession

 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,

 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by

 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their
 13 16 agreement with EDA, to collect and provide any information
 13 17 reasonably required by EDA in order to fulfill this reporting
 13 18 requirement.
 13 19    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 13 20 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 13 21 calendar year 2022.
 13 22    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has

 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's

 10 30    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 10 31   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 10 32 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 10 33 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 10 34 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 10 35 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 11  1 defined in the division.
 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal

 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An

 11  2    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 11  3 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,

 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered

 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the

 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"

 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for

 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.

 11  4 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 11  5 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 11  6 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 11  7 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 11  8 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 11  9 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 11 10 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 11 11 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 11 12 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 11 13 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 11 14 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 11 15 by the EDA.
 11 16    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 11 17 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 13  3 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 13  8 otherwise ordered by a court.
 13  9    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 13 10 and the governor an annual report describing the activities
 13 11 of the program for each calendar year.  The report for the
 13 12 first calendar year the tax credit is available under the
 13 13 program (2017) is due by January 31, 2019, and reports covering
 13 14 subsequent calendar years are due by the same date each year
 13 15 thereafter.  Eligible businesses are required, as part of their

 11 18 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 11 19 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 11 20 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 11 21 application deadline.
 11 22    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 11 23 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 11 24 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 11 25 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 11 26 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 11 27 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 11 28 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 11 29 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 11 30    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 11 31 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 11 32 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 11 33 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 11 34 claimed tax credits.
 11 35    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 12  1 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 12  2 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 12  3 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 12  4 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 12  5 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 12  6 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 12  7 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 12  8 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 12  9 the tax credit.
 12 10    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 12 11 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 12 12 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 12 13 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 12 14 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 12 15 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 12 16 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 12 17 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 12 18    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 12 19 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 12 20 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 12 21 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 12 22 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 12 23 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 12 24 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 12 25 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 12 26 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 12 27 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 12 28 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 12 29 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 12 30 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 12 31 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 12 32 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 12 33 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 12 34 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 12 35    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 13  1 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 13  2 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 13  4 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 13  5 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 13  6 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 13  7 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
