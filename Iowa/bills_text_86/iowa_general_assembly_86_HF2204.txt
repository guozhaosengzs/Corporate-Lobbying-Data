  6  2 exceed $500, is to be paid as a reward to a person who gave
  6  3 information leading to the conviction. However, this reward
  6  4 does not apply to law enforcement officers or agents of the

  6  6    The bill provides that ivory or rhinoceros horn seized upon
  6  7 a conviction is forfeited and will either be maintained by the
