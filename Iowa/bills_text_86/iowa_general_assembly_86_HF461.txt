  5  4 "c"  5  4 "c"  5  5                           EXPLANATION
  5  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  8    This bill relates to the statewide preschool program by
  5  9 requiring the department of education to establish, administer,
  5 10 and phase=in a full=day preschool program as part of the
  5 11 statewide preschool program.
  5 12    Code chapter 256C defines preschool program requirements
  5 13 that are used to determine whether or not a local program
  5 14 implemented by a school district approved to participate in
  5 15 the statewide preschool program for four=year=old children
  5 16 qualifies as an approved local program. Current law requires a
  5 17 minimum of 10 hours per week of instruction delivered on the
  5 18 skills and knowledge included in the student learning standards
  5 19 developed for the preschool program.
  5 20    For school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2016,
  5 21 but before July 1, 2025, the bill requires the department
  5 22 of education to administer and select school districts
  5 23 for participation in a full=day preschool program as part
  5 24 of the statewide preschool program. Each school district
  5 25 that applies and is selected to participate in the full=day
  5 26 preschool program shall provide a minimum of 30 hours per
  5 27 week of instruction delivered on the skills and knowledge
  5 28 included in the student learning standards developed for the
  5 29 preschool program. However, for a school district measuring
  5 30 instructional time in hours instead of days, the minimum number
  5 31 of hours per week of instruction shall be equal to the number
  5 32 of instructional hours per week established by the school
  5 33 district in the school calendar for the same school year.
  5 34    Utilizing all of the following selection criteria, the
  5 35 department of education is required to review applications
  6  1 and select school districts for participation in the full=day
  6  2 preschool program: (1) priority shall be given to school
  6  3 districts that do not have existing preschool programming
  6  4 within the school district boundaries; (2) priority shall
  6  5 be given to school districts that have a high percentage
  6  6 of children in poverty, and such children shall receive
  6  7 first priority for the programs; (3) consideration shall
  6  8 be given to the size of school districts in large, medium,
  6  9 and small categories in order for there to be equitable
  6 10 statewide distribution of preschool program services; and
  6 11 (4) consideration shall be given to school districts with
  6 12 established, high=quality community partnerships for the
  6 13 delivery of preschool programming that are seeking to expand
  6 14 access.
  6 15    In addition to the specified selection criteria, the bill
  6 16 limits the number of school districts that may be selected
  6 17 by the department to participate in the full=day preschool
  6 18 program. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2016, the
  6 19 department may not select more than 10 percent of all school
  6 20 districts in the state.  For each budget year thereafter the
  6 21 limit on the number of school districts that may be selected
  6 22 increases by 10 percentage points until the requirements of
  6 23 the full=day preschool program become applicable to all school
  6 24 districts participating in the statewide preschool program
  6 25 under Code chapter 256C in the budget year beginning July 1,
  6 26 2025.
  6 27    Under Code chapter 256C, state funding is based upon the
  6 28 enrollment of eligible students in the preschool programming
  6 29 provided by a school district approved to participate in the
  6 30 preschool program. The amount of preschool foundation aid
  6 31 is the product of the regular program state cost per pupil
  6 32 for the budget year multiplied by the school district's
  6 33 preschool budget enrollment. Current law defines "preschool
  6 34 budget enrollment" to mean the figure that is equal to 50
  6 35 percent of the actual enrollment of eligible students in the
  7  1 preschool programming provided by a school district approved
  7  2 to participate in the preschool program in the base year. The
  7  3 bill provides that for districts approved to participate in the
  7  4 full=day preschool program, the "preschool budget enrollment"
  7  5 is equal to the actual enrollment of eligible students in the
  7  6 preschool programming provided by a school district approved to
  7  7 participate in the preschool program in the base year.
  7  8    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  7  9 1, 2025, the requirement of 30 instructional hours and the
  7 10 change in the definition of "preschool budget enrollment" for
  7 11 funding purposes apply to all school districts approved to
  7 12 participate in the preschool program under Code chapter 256C.
  7 13  However, for a school district measuring instructional time in
  7 14 hours instead of days, the minimum number of hours per week
  7 15 of instruction shall be equal to the number of instructional
  7 16 hours per week established by the school district in the school
  7 17 calendar for the same school year.
  7 18    The bill also amends provisions relating to the preschool
  7 19 foundation aid received by a school district for the initial
  7 20 school year for which a school district approved to participate
  7 21 in the preschool program to match the applicable percentage
  7 22 under the definition of "preschool budget enrollment" as
  7 23 modified in the bill.

  5 23 for participation in a full=day preschool program as part
  5 24 of the statewide preschool program. Each school district
  5 25 that applies and is selected to participate in the full=day
  5 26 preschool program shall provide a minimum of 30 hours per

  6 19 department may not select more than 10 percent of all school
  6 20 districts in the state.  For each budget year thereafter the
  6 21 limit on the number of school districts that may be selected
  6 22 increases by 10 percentage points until the requirements of
  6 23 the full=day preschool program become applicable to all school

  6 25 under Code chapter 256C in the budget year beginning July 1,

  6 27    Under Code chapter 256C, state funding is based upon the
  6 28 enrollment of eligible students in the preschool programming
  6 29 provided by a school district approved to participate in the
  6 30 preschool program. The amount of preschool foundation aid
  6 31 is the product of the regular program state cost per pupil
  6 32 for the budget year multiplied by the school district's
  6 33 preschool budget enrollment. Current law defines "preschool
  6 34 budget enrollment" to mean the figure that is equal to 50
  6 35 percent of the actual enrollment of eligible students in the
  7  1 preschool programming provided by a school district approved
  7  2 to participate in the preschool program in the base year. The

  7  5 is equal to the actual enrollment of eligible students in the
  7  6 preschool programming provided by a school district approved to

  7 12 participate in the preschool program under Code chapter 256C.
  7 13  However, for a school district measuring instructional time in
  7 14 hours instead of days, the minimum number of hours per week
  7 15 of instruction shall be equal to the number of instructional
  7 16 hours per week established by the school district in the school
  7 17 calendar for the same school year.
  7 18    The bill also amends provisions relating to the preschool
  7 19 foundation aid received by a school district for the initial

  7 21 in the preschool program to match the applicable percentage

  6 31 is the product of the regular program state cost per pupil
  6 32 for the budget year multiplied by the school district's
  6 33 preschool budget enrollment. Current law defines "preschool

  6 28 enrollment of eligible students in the preschool programming
