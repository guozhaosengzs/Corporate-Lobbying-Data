  3 20 that the relocation is a substantial change in circumstances,
  3 21 the court is required to modify the custody order to, at
  3 22 a minimum, preserve, as nearly as possible, the existing
  3 23 relationship between the minor child and the nonrelocating

  4  1 the court and to the other parent. Upon motion of any party
  4  2 or upon the court's own motion, the court shall schedule a
  4  3 hearing  to review the notice of relocation to determine if the
  4  4 relocation is a substantial change in circumstances and if the
  4  5 relocation is in the best interest of the child. The burden
  4  6 of proving that relocation is in the child's best interest is
  4  7 on the relocating parent. In determining if the relocation is
  4  8 in the best interest of the child, in addition to the factors
  4  9 currently specified for the awarding of custody, the bill
  4 10 specifies other factors relating to the relocation that the
  4 11 court shall consider.
  4 12    If the court determines that the relocation is a substantial
  4 13 change in circumstances and is in the best interest of the
  4 14 child, the court shall modify the custody order to, as is
  4 15 currently the law,  at a minimum, preserve, as nearly as
  4 16 possible, the existing relationship between the minor child and
  4 17 the nonrelocating parent. If modified, the order may include
  4 18 a provision for extended visitation during summer vacations
  4 19 and school breaks and scheduled telephone contact between the
  4 20 nonrelocating parent and the minor child. The modification
  4 21 may include a provision assigning the responsibility for
  4 22 transportation of the minor child for visitation purposes to
  4 23 either or both parents.
  4 24    If the court determines that the relocation is a substantial
  4 25 change in circumstances, but is not in the best interest of
  4 26 the child, the court shall do one of the following: (1) if
  4 27 the nonrelocating parent has joint legal custody, the court
  4 28 shall modify the custody order to award physical care to
  4 29 the nonrelocating parent and to provide visitation to the
  4 30 relocating parent to, at a minimum, preserve, as nearly as
  4 31 possible, the existing relationship between the minor child
  4 32 and the relocating parent; or (2) if the relocating parent has
  4 33 sole legal custody, the court shall modify the custody order
  4 34 to provide increased visitation to the nonrelocating parent
  4 35 in addition to that provided under the existing custody order
  5  1 and may include a provision assigning the responsibility for
  5  2 transportation of the minor child for visitation purposes to

  3 30    Under the bill, if a parent awarded joint legal custody and

  4 12    If the court determines that the relocation is a substantial

  4 14 child, the court shall modify the custody order to, as is
  4 15 currently the law,  at a minimum, preserve, as nearly as
