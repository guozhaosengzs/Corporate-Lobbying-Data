  9 18 industry council" to the "executive committee" of the Iowa beef
  9 19 cattle producers association shall not affect the appointment

  9 21 industry council immediately prior to the effective date of

  9 23 committee until the member's term expires.
  9 24    2.  The executive committee of the Iowa beef cattle producers

 10  2    1.  It is amended, rescinded, or supplemented by the
 10  3 affirmative action of the executive council of the Iowa beef
 10  4 cattle producers association created in section 181.3, as

 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has
 11  7 been certified to serve as a "qualified state beef council"
 11  8 administering the federal checkoff in this state although the
 11  9 council is authorized to seek certification (Code section
 11 10 181.7A).  The council's voting members include five producers
 11 11 who are elected at IBCPA's annual meeting (Code section
 11 12 181.6A), one representative of the Iowa livestock auction
 11 13 market association appointed by the secretary of agriculture
 11 14 from two nominations submitted by that association or another
 11 15 livestock market representative, the secretary of agriculture,
 11 16 and the dean of the college of agriculture and life sciences of
 11 17 Iowa state university of science and technology (Code section

  9 14 that the assessment is terminated.

  9 25 association created in section 181.3 as amended in this Act may

  9 27 Iowa cattlemen's association under that section to ensure those
  9 28 members serve staggered terms.  The executive committee shall

  9 32 ACTIONS AND DOCUMENTS.  Any rule, form, order, or directive
  9 33 promulgated by the Iowa beef industry council created in
  9 34 section 181.3, in force and effect immediately prior to the
  9 35 effective date of this Act, shall continue in full force and
 10  1 effect until the earlier of the following:
 10  2    1.  It is amended, rescinded, or supplemented by the
 10  3 affirmative action of the executive council of the Iowa beef
 10  4 cattle producers association created in section 181.3, as

  9 17    1.  This Act's amendments changing the name of the "Iowa beef
  9 18 industry council" to the "executive committee" of the Iowa beef
  9 19 cattle producers association shall not affect the appointment
  9 20 or term of office of a member who served on the Iowa beef
  9 21 industry council immediately prior to the effective date of
  9 22 this Act.  That member shall continue to serve on the executive
  9 23 committee until the member's term expires.
  9 24    2.  The executive committee of the Iowa beef cattle producers
  9 25 association created in section 181.3 as amended in this Act may
  9 26 establish initial terms for the two members appointed by the
  9 27 Iowa cattlemen's association under that section to ensure those

  9 32 ACTIONS AND DOCUMENTS.  Any rule, form, order, or directive
  9 33 promulgated by the Iowa beef industry council created in
  9 34 section 181.3, in force and effect immediately prior to the
  9 35 effective date of this Act, shall continue in full force and
 10  1 effect until the earlier of the following:
 10  2    1.  It is amended, rescinded, or supplemented by the
 10  3 affirmative action of the executive council of the Iowa beef
 10  4 cattle producers association created in section 181.3, as

 10  7                           EXPLANATION
 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the

 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has
 11  7 been certified to serve as a "qualified state beef council"
 11  8 administering the federal checkoff in this state although the
 11  9 council is authorized to seek certification (Code section
 11 10 181.7A).  The council's voting members include five producers
 11 11 who are elected at IBCPA's annual meeting (Code section
 11 12 181.6A), one representative of the Iowa livestock auction
 11 13 market association appointed by the secretary of agriculture
 11 14 from two nominations submitted by that association or another

 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has

 10  1 effect until the earlier of the following:
 10  2    1.  It is amended, rescinded, or supplemented by the
 10  3 affirmative action of the executive council of the Iowa beef
 10  4 cattle producers association created in section 181.3, as
 10  5 amended in this Act.

 10  7                           EXPLANATION
 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has
 11  7 been certified to serve as a "qualified state beef council"
 11  8 administering the federal checkoff in this state although the
 11  9 council is authorized to seek certification (Code section
 11 10 181.7A).  The council's voting members include five producers
 11 11 who are elected at IBCPA's annual meeting (Code section
 11 12 181.6A), one representative of the Iowa livestock auction
 11 13 market association appointed by the secretary of agriculture
 11 14 from two nominations submitted by that association or another
 11 15 livestock market representative, the secretary of agriculture,
 11 16 and the dean of the college of agriculture and life sciences of
 11 17 Iowa state university of science and technology (Code section

 10  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 10    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of the
 10 11 Iowa beef cattle producers association (IBCPA).  It changes the
 10 12 name of its governing entity from "Iowa beef industry council"
 10 13 (council) to "executive committee" (committee) and adds two
 10 14 new voting members who are producers appointed by the Iowa
 10 15 cattlemen's association (amended Code section 181.3).  The bill
 10 16 also eliminates certain IBCPA duties, including eliminating
 10 17 requirements to conduct instruction regarding the breeding and
 10 18 raising of cattle and to engage in activities that demonstrate
 10 19 or promote cattle feeding.  Instead, the IBCPA would be
 10 20 required to engage in marketing, research, and education
 10 21 efforts (Code section 181.2).
 10 22    TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.  The bill does not affect the
 10 23 appointment or term of office of a current member of the
 10 24 council due to its name change to a committee.  It authorizes
 10 25 the committee to establish the initial terms of office for
 10 26 the two new appointed members.  Until the new members are
 10 27 appointed, the committee's quorum and voting requirements
 10 28 remain unchanged.  Any rule or other legal document in effect
 10 29 immediately prior to the bill's effective date continues in
 10 30 full force and effect until amended, rescinded, or supplemented
 10 31 by the executive committee or it expires by its own terms.
 10 32    BACKGROUND.  Code chapter 181 provides that upon the passage
 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15
 11  1 and 181.19), collected by first purchasers, and forwarded to
 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has
 11  7 been certified to serve as a "qualified state beef council"
 11  8 administering the federal checkoff in this state although the
 11  9 council is authorized to seek certification (Code section
 11 10 181.7A).  The council's voting members include five producers
 11 11 who are elected at IBCPA's annual meeting (Code section
 11 12 181.6A), one representative of the Iowa livestock auction
 11 13 market association appointed by the secretary of agriculture
 11 14 from two nominations submitted by that association or another

 10 33 of a referendum of cattle producers, there is imposed an
 10 34 assessment, which is an excise tax or "checkoff", on the sale
 10 35 of each head of cattle paid by producers (Code sections 181.15

 11  2 the council (Code section 181.11), but subject to a producer's
 11  3 right to demand a refund (Code section 181.12).  The state
 11  4 checkoff has been superceded by a federal checkoff under the
 11  5 terms of the federal Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985
 11  6 (7 U.S.C. {2901 et seq.).  Under that Act, the IBCPA has
