  4  3 which directly converts and then transfers or stores solar
  4  4 energy into usable forms of thermal or electrical energy.
  4  5    The bill prohibits a county or city from adopting an
  4  6 ordinance or other regulation that directly or indirectly
  4  7 restricts the installation, operation, or use of a solar
  4  8 energy system unless the ordinance preserves or protects the
  4  9 public health or safety, does not significantly increase the
  4 10 cost of the system or decrease its efficiency, or allows for
  4 11 alternative installation, operation, or use of a solar energy
  4 12 system of comparable cost and efficiency.
  4 13    The bill authorizes a county or city to adopt an ordinance or
  4 14 other regulation that places restrictions on obstructions to a
  4 15 solar energy system, which may include responsibility for costs
  4 16 of limiting or abating the obstruction, but cannot require the
  4 17 trimming of vegetation planted before a solar energy system is
  4 18 installed. If a county adopts such an ordinance it will apply
  4 19 to the entire county unless a city adopts an ordinance.
  4 20    The bill amends Code chapter 657, relating to nuisances,
  4 21 by making it a nuisance to obstruct a solar energy system on
  4 22 a nearby or adjoining property after the solar energy system
  4 23 has been installed. The bill defines "obstruction" to mean
  4 24 the portion of a structure or vegetation that blocks solar
  4 25 energy from a solar energy system between the hours of 9 a.m.
  4 26 to 3 p.m. standard time, not including blockage by a pole,

  3 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 34    This bill relates to the installation, operation, and use of
  3 35 solar energy systems by limiting local zoning authority and by
  4  1 making certain obstructions an actionable nuisance.
  4  2    The bill defines "solar energy system" to mean equipment
  4  3 which directly converts and then transfers or stores solar
  4  4 energy into usable forms of thermal or electrical energy.
  4  5    The bill prohibits a county or city from adopting an
  4  6 ordinance or other regulation that directly or indirectly
  4  7 restricts the installation, operation, or use of a solar
  4  8 energy system unless the ordinance preserves or protects the
  4  9 public health or safety, does not significantly increase the
  4 10 cost of the system or decrease its efficiency, or allows for
  4 11 alternative installation, operation, or use of a solar energy
  4 12 system of comparable cost and efficiency.
  4 13    The bill authorizes a county or city to adopt an ordinance or
  4 14 other regulation that places restrictions on obstructions to a
  4 15 solar energy system, which may include responsibility for costs
  4 16 of limiting or abating the obstruction, but cannot require the
  4 17 trimming of vegetation planted before a solar energy system is
  4 18 installed. If a county adopts such an ordinance it will apply
  4 19 to the entire county unless a city adopts an ordinance.
  4 20    The bill amends Code chapter 657, relating to nuisances,
  4 21 by making it a nuisance to obstruct a solar energy system on

  3 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 34    This bill relates to the installation, operation, and use of
  3 35 solar energy systems by limiting local zoning authority and by
  4  1 making certain obstructions an actionable nuisance.
  4  2    The bill defines "solar energy system" to mean equipment
  4  3 which directly converts and then transfers or stores solar
  4  4 energy into usable forms of thermal or electrical energy.
  4  5    The bill prohibits a county or city from adopting an
  4  6 ordinance or other regulation that directly or indirectly
  4  7 restricts the installation, operation, or use of a solar
  4  8 energy system unless the ordinance preserves or protects the
  4  9 public health or safety, does not significantly increase the
  4 10 cost of the system or decrease its efficiency, or allows for
  4 11 alternative installation, operation, or use of a solar energy
  4 12 system of comparable cost and efficiency.
  4 13    The bill authorizes a county or city to adopt an ordinance or
  4 14 other regulation that places restrictions on obstructions to a
  4 15 solar energy system, which may include responsibility for costs
  4 16 of limiting or abating the obstruction, but cannot require the
  4 17 trimming of vegetation planted before a solar energy system is
  4 18 installed. If a county adopts such an ordinance it will apply
  4 19 to the entire county unless a city adopts an ordinance.
  4 20    The bill amends Code chapter 657, relating to nuisances,
