  3 24 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall

  4  9 not less than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner
  4 10 of property within the proposed promotion area at the owner's
  4 11 address as shown by the records of the county auditor. If a
  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  4 29 shall hear all owners of property in the proposed promotion
  4 30 area or residents of the city, or county, if applicable,
  4 31 desiring to express their views. The council must wait at
  4 32 least thirty days after the public hearing has been held before
  4 33 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a promotion area which
  4 34 must be comprised of all the property which the council finds
  4 35 has the relationship described in subsection 1, paragraph
  5  1 "c". Property included in the promotion area proposed in the
  5  2 petition need not be included in the established promotion
  5  3 area. However, the council may not include property in the
  5  4 promotion area that was not included in the petition proposing
  5  5 the area until the council has held another public hearing
  5  6 after it has published and mailed notice in the same manner
  5  7 as required in subsection 4 and containing the information
  5  8 required in subsection 5, or has caused a notice of the
  5  9 inclusion of the property to be personally served upon each
  5 10 owner of the additional property, or has received a written
  5 11 waiver of notice from each owner of the additional property.
  5 12    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a promotion area
  5 13 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5 14 members of the council, or in cities having but three members
  5 15 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5 16 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at

  5 18 proposed promotion area representing ownership of property
  5 19 with an assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the
  5 20 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed promotion
  5 21 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote
  5 22 of the council.
  5 23    8.  The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed
  5 24 in the office of the county recorder of each county in which
  5 25 any property within the promotion area is located.
  5 26    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance

  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall

  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the

  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's

  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the
  6 16 council exceeded its authority. An action may not be brought
  6 17 questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to
  6 18 the establishment of a promotion area or the validity of the
  6 19 promotion, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of
  6 20 any property within or from the promotion area, or the ability

  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  4 33 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a promotion area which
  4 34 must be comprised of all the property which the council finds
  4 35 has the relationship described in subsection 1, paragraph

  5  2 petition need not be included in the established promotion
  5  3 area. However, the council may not include property in the
  5  4 promotion area that was not included in the petition proposing
  5  5 the area until the council has held another public hearing
  5  6 after it has published and mailed notice in the same manner
  5  7 as required in subsection 4 and containing the information
  5  8 required in subsection 5, or has caused a notice of the
  5  9 inclusion of the property to be personally served upon each

  5 12    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a promotion area
  5 13 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5 14 members of the council, or in cities having but three members

  5 18 proposed promotion area representing ownership of property
  5 19 with an assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the
  5 20 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed promotion
  5 21 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote
  5 22 of the council.
  5 23    8.  The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed
  5 24 in the office of the county recorder of each county in which
  5 25 any property within the promotion area is located.
  5 26    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 27 establishing a promotion area, the entire matter of

  6 12 part of the promotion area is located, within thirty days after
  6 13 the date upon which the ordinance creating the promotion area
  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the
  6 16 council exceeded its authority. An action may not be brought
  6 17 questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to
  6 18 the establishment of a promotion area or the validity of the
  6 19 promotion, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of
  6 20 any property within or from the promotion area, or the ability

  5 12    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a promotion area
  5 13 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5 14 members of the council, or in cities having but three members
  5 15 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5 16 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5 17 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 18 proposed promotion area representing ownership of property
  5 19 with an assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the
  5 20 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed promotion
  5 21 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote
  5 22 of the council.
  5 23    8.  The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed
  5 24 in the office of the county recorder of each county in which
  5 25 any property within the promotion area is located.

  5 27 establishing a promotion area, the entire matter of

  5 30 such area is filed with the city clerk containing the
  5 31 signatures of at least forty percent of all owners of property
  5 32 within the proposed promotion area or signatures which together
  5 33 represent ownership of property with an assessed value of forty
  5 34 percent or more of the assessed value of all property within
  5 35 the proposed promotion area.
  6  1    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a promotion
  6  2 area is a legislative determination that the property within
  6  3 the promotion area has the relationship required under
  6  4 subsection 1, paragraph "c", and includes all of the property
  6  5 within the promotion area which has that relationship in the
  6  6 promotion area.

  6  8 unincorporated area of the county, if applicable, may appeal
  6  9 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  6 10 creation of the promotion area and the imposition of the local

  6 12 part of the promotion area is located, within thirty days after
  6 13 the date upon which the ordinance creating the promotion area
  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the
  6 16 council exceeded its authority. An action may not be brought
  6 17 questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to
  6 18 the establishment of a promotion area or the validity of the
  6 19 promotion, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of
  6 20 any property within or from the promotion area, or the ability
  6 21 to impose a local lodging fee in accordance with the ordinance
  6 22 establishing the promotion area, after thirty days from the

  3 15 city planning commission to make recommendations to the council
  3 16 in regard to the proposed promotion area. The city planning
  3 17 commission shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative
  3 18 report for the council on the merit and feasibility of the
  3 19 promotion services for the proposed promotion area. The
  3 20 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 21 action on the establishment of the promotion area until it
  3 22 has received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 23 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,
  3 24 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall
  3 27 notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission upon
  3 28 receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the
  3 29 same duties set forth in this subsection as a city planning
  3 30 commission. If no planning commission exists, the council
  3 31 shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of a petition,
  3 32 and such commission shall have the same duties set forth in
  3 33 this subsection as a city planning commission. If no planning
  3 34 or zoning commission exists, the council shall, upon receipt of
  3 35 a petition, conduct a public hearing on the establishment of
  4  1 a promotion area.
  4  2    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report or after
  4  3 the hearing has been conducted, as applicable, the council
  4  4 shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the council

  4  9 not less than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner
  4 10 of property within the proposed promotion area at the owner's
  4 11 address as shown by the records of the county auditor. If a
  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  4 30 area or residents of the city, or county, if applicable,
  4 31 desiring to express their views. The council must wait at

  4 33 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a promotion area which

  4 35 has the relationship described in subsection 1, paragraph
  5  1 "c". Property included in the promotion area proposed in the
  5  2 petition need not be included in the established promotion
  5  3 area. However, the council may not include property in the
  5  4 promotion area that was not included in the petition proposing
  5  5 the area until the council has held another public hearing
  5  6 after it has published and mailed notice in the same manner
  5  7 as required in subsection 4 and containing the information
  5  8 required in subsection 5, or has caused a notice of the
  5  9 inclusion of the property to be personally served upon each

  5 13 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5 14 members of the council, or in cities having but three members
  5 15 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,

  5 18 proposed promotion area representing ownership of property
  5 19 with an assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the
  5 20 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed promotion
  5 21 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote
  5 22 of the council.
  5 23    8.  The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed
  5 24 in the office of the county recorder of each county in which
  5 25 any property within the promotion area is located.
  5 26    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 27 establishing a promotion area, the entire matter of
  5 28 establishing such promotion area shall be withdrawn from
  5 29 council consideration if a petition objecting to establishing
  5 30 such area is filed with the city clerk containing the
  5 31 signatures of at least forty percent of all owners of property

  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the
  6 16 council exceeded its authority. An action may not be brought
  6 17 questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to
  6 18 the establishment of a promotion area or the validity of the
  6 19 promotion, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of
  6 20 any property within or from the promotion area, or the ability

  3 19 promotion services for the proposed promotion area. The
  3 20 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 21 action on the establishment of the promotion area until it
  3 22 has received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 23 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,

  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall
  3 27 notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission upon
  3 28 receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the
  3 29 same duties set forth in this subsection as a city planning
  3 30 commission. If no planning commission exists, the council
  3 31 shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of a petition,
  3 32 and such commission shall have the same duties set forth in

  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed

  3 16 in regard to the proposed promotion area. The city planning
  3 17 commission shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative
  3 18 report for the council on the merit and feasibility of the
  3 19 promotion services for the proposed promotion area. The
  3 20 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further

  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall
  3 27 notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission upon
  3 28 receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the
  3 29 same duties set forth in this subsection as a city planning
  3 30 commission. If no planning commission exists, the council
  3 31 shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of a petition,
  3 32 and such commission shall have the same duties set forth in
  3 33 this subsection as a city planning commission. If no planning
  3 34 or zoning commission exists, the council shall, upon receipt of
  3 35 a petition, conduct a public hearing on the establishment of
  4  1 a promotion area.
  4  2    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report or after
  4  3 the hearing has been conducted, as applicable, the council
  4  4 shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the council

  4  9 not less than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner
  4 10 of property within the proposed promotion area at the owner's
  4 11 address as shown by the records of the county auditor. If a
  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  4 30 area or residents of the city, or county, if applicable,

  4 33 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a promotion area which
  4 34 must be comprised of all the property which the council finds
  4 35 has the relationship described in subsection 1, paragraph
  5  1 "c". Property included in the promotion area proposed in the
  5  2 petition need not be included in the established promotion
  5  3 area. However, the council may not include property in the
  5  4 promotion area that was not included in the petition proposing
  5  5 the area until the council has held another public hearing
  5  6 after it has published and mailed notice in the same manner
  5  7 as required in subsection 4 and containing the information
  5  8 required in subsection 5, or has caused a notice of the
  5  9 inclusion of the property to be personally served upon each
  5 10 owner of the additional property, or has received a written
  5 11 waiver of notice from each owner of the additional property.
  5 12    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a promotion area
  5 13 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5 14 members of the council, or in cities having but three members
  5 15 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5 16 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5 17 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 18 proposed promotion area representing ownership of property
  5 19 with an assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the
  5 20 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed promotion
  5 21 area, the adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote
  5 22 of the council.
  5 23    8.  The clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be filed
  5 24 in the office of the county recorder of each county in which
  5 25 any property within the promotion area is located.
  5 26    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 27 establishing a promotion area, the entire matter of
  5 28 establishing such promotion area shall be withdrawn from
  5 29 council consideration if a petition objecting to establishing
  5 30 such area is filed with the city clerk containing the
  5 31 signatures of at least forty percent of all owners of property
  5 32 within the proposed promotion area or signatures which together
  5 33 represent ownership of property with an assessed value of forty
  5 34 percent or more of the assessed value of all property within
  5 35 the proposed promotion area.
  6  1    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a promotion
  6  2 area is a legislative determination that the property within
  6  3 the promotion area has the relationship required under
  6  4 subsection 1, paragraph "c", and includes all of the property
  6  5 within the promotion area which has that relationship in the
  6  6 promotion area.
  6  7    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city, or of the
  6  8 unincorporated area of the county, if applicable, may appeal
  6  9 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  6 10 creation of the promotion area and the imposition of the local
  6 11 lodging fee, to the district court of the county in which any
  6 12 part of the promotion area is located, within thirty days after
  6 13 the date upon which the ordinance creating the promotion area
  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the
  6 16 council exceeded its authority. An action may not be brought
  6 17 questioning the regularity of the proceedings pertaining to
  6 18 the establishment of a promotion area or the validity of the
  6 19 promotion, or the propriety of the inclusion or exclusion of
  6 20 any property within or from the promotion area, or the ability
  6 21 to impose a local lodging fee in accordance with the ordinance
  6 22 establishing the promotion area, after thirty days from the
  6 23 date on which the ordinance creating the promotion area becomes

  3 19 promotion services for the proposed promotion area. The
  3 20 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 21 action on the establishment of the promotion area until it
  3 22 has received the report of the city planning commission. In

  3 25 promotion area.
  3 26    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council shall
  3 27 notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission upon
  3 28 receipt of a petition, and such commission shall have the
  3 29 same duties set forth in this subsection as a city planning
  3 30 commission. If no planning commission exists, the council
  3 31 shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of a petition,
  3 32 and such commission shall have the same duties set forth in

  3 34 or zoning commission exists, the council shall, upon receipt of
  3 35 a petition, conduct a public hearing on the establishment of
  4  1 a promotion area.
  4  2    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report or after
  4  3 the hearing has been conducted, as applicable, the council
  4  4 shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the council

  4 12 property is shown to be in the name of more than one owner
  4 13 at the same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed
  4 14 addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive
  4 15 a mailed notice is not grounds for objection to the council's
  4 16 taking any action authorized in this section, section 386.4A,
  4 17 section 386.5A, or section 386.5B.
  4 18    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for

  6 14 becomes effective, but the action and decision of the council
  6 15 are final and conclusive unless the court finds that the

 11 10    The bill requires the council to initiate proceedings
 11 11 for establishing a promotion area upon the filing of a

 11 20 services for the proposed promotion area. The bill provides
 11 21 alternative procedures in the event the city does not have a
 11 22 planning commission.
 11 23    Upon the receipt of the commission's final report, the
 11 24 council shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the

 11 28 the approval of an ordinance establishing a promotion area,
 11 29 provisions which remove the entire matter from the council's
 11 30 consideration, appeal provisions relating to the establishment
 11 31 of a promotion area, provisions governing amendments to the
 11 32 ordinance creating the promotion area, and provisions governing
 11 33 the dissolution of the promotion area. Such requirements and
 11 34 provisions are similar to those in current Code chapter 386
 11 35 for establishment of a self=supported municipal improvement

 12 12 fee shall be collected by the lessor of lodging from the user
 12 13 of that lodging. The lessor shall add the fee to the sales
 12 14 price of the lodging, and the fee shall be stated as a distinct

 12 16 and taxes imposed.  Local lodging fees collected by a lessor
 12 17 shall be due and payable to the city according to a schedule
 12 18 specified in the ordinance. A lessor is liable for the payment
 12 19 of fees to the city in the same manner as liability is imposed

 12 21    The bill requires that local lodging fees received by a city
 12 22 be deposited in a promotion area account within the city's
 12 23 general fund.   Moneys in a promotion area account shall be

 12 25 area. The bill defines "promotion services" to mean any
 12 26 of the following: promotion of public events that benefit
 12 27 businesses or property in a promotion area; coordinating live
 12 28 music performances in a promotion area; coordinating promotion,

 10 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 28    This bill authorizes the establishment of promotion areas by
 10 29 cities and authorizes the imposition of a local lodging fee in
 10 30 those promotion areas.
 10 31    Under the bill, a promotion area may be created by action
 10 32 of the city council under Code chapter 386 (self=supported
 10 33 municipal improvement districts).  A promotion area must be
 10 34 comprised of contiguous property wholly within the boundaries
 10 35 of the city but may include property in the unincorporated
 11  1 area of the county that is contiguous to the property of the
 11  2 proposed area if the county board of supervisors approves its
 11  3 inclusion by resolution.  The bill requires that the promotion
 11  4 area be comprised of property related in some manner, including
 11  5 but not limited to present or potential use, physical location,
 11  6 condition, relationship to an area, or relationship to present
 11  7 or potential commercial or other activity in an area, so as to
 11  8 be benefited in any manner from the performance of promotion
 11  9 services in the area.
 11 10    The bill requires the council to initiate proceedings
 11 11 for establishing a promotion area upon the filing of a
 11 12 petition containing a specified number of signatures and other
 11 13 information specified in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires the council to notify the city planning
 11 15 commission upon the receipt of a petition, and the planning
 11 16 commission is required to make recommendations to the council
 11 17 in regard to the proposed promotion area. The city planning
 11 18 commission is also required to prepare an evaluative report
 11 19 for the council on the merit and feasibility of the promotion
 11 20 services for the proposed promotion area. The bill provides
 11 21 alternative procedures in the event the city does not have a
 11 22 planning commission.
 11 23    Upon the receipt of the commission's final report, the
 11 24 council shall set a time and place for a meeting at which the
 11 25 council proposes to take action for the establishment of the
 11 26 promotion area and receive comments from residents.
 11 27    The bill establishes council voting requirements for
 11 28 the approval of an ordinance establishing a promotion area,
 11 29 provisions which remove the entire matter from the council's
 11 30 consideration, appeal provisions relating to the establishment
 11 31 of a promotion area, provisions governing amendments to the
 11 32 ordinance creating the promotion area, and provisions governing
 11 33 the dissolution of the promotion area. Such requirements and
 11 34 provisions are similar to those in current Code chapter 386
 11 35 for establishment of a self=supported municipal improvement
 12  1 district.
 12  2    The bill provides that except for the local lodging fee
 12  3 authorized in the bill, a city is not authorized to levy any
 12  4 taxes authorized in Code chapter 386 within a promotion area
 12  5 unless the city has also established a district in accordance
 12  6 with the provisions of Code chapter 386 that includes the
 12  7 property comprising the promotion area.
 12  8    Following establishment of a promotion area, as part of the
 12  9 ordinance establishing the promotion area, a city may impose a
 12 10 local lodging fee to be imposed on each night of lodging rental
 12 11 at a lessor located in the promotion area.  The local lodging
 12 12 fee shall be collected by the lessor of lodging from the user
 12 13 of that lodging. The lessor shall add the fee to the sales
 12 14 price of the lodging, and the fee shall be stated as a distinct
 12 15 item separate and apart from the sales price of the lodging
 12 16 and taxes imposed.  Local lodging fees collected by a lessor
 12 17 shall be due and payable to the city according to a schedule

 12 21    The bill requires that local lodging fees received by a city
 12 22 be deposited in a promotion area account within the city's

 12 24 used for promotion services within the applicable promotion
 12 25 area. The bill defines "promotion services" to mean any

 11 27    The bill establishes council voting requirements for
 11 28 the approval of an ordinance establishing a promotion area,
 11 29 provisions which remove the entire matter from the council's
 11 30 consideration, appeal provisions relating to the establishment
 11 31 of a promotion area, provisions governing amendments to the
 11 32 ordinance creating the promotion area, and provisions governing
 11 33 the dissolution of the promotion area. Such requirements and

 12  1 district.
 12  2    The bill provides that except for the local lodging fee
 12  3 authorized in the bill, a city is not authorized to levy any

 12 11 at a lessor located in the promotion area.  The local lodging
 12 12 fee shall be collected by the lessor of lodging from the user
 12 13 of that lodging. The lessor shall add the fee to the sales
 12 14 price of the lodging, and the fee shall be stated as a distinct

 12 16 and taxes imposed.  Local lodging fees collected by a lessor
 12 17 shall be due and payable to the city according to a schedule
 12 18 specified in the ordinance. A lessor is liable for the payment
 12 19 of fees to the city in the same manner as liability is imposed
 12 20 on retailers for the payment of certain state taxes.
 12 21    The bill requires that local lodging fees received by a city
 12 22 be deposited in a promotion area account within the city's

 12 24 used for promotion services within the applicable promotion
 12 25 area. The bill defines "promotion services" to mean any
 12 26 of the following: promotion of public events that benefit
 12 27 businesses or property in a promotion area; coordinating live
 12 28 music performances in a promotion area; coordinating promotion,
