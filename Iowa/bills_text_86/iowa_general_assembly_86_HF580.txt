  1 12    (1)  The water treatment system has all claims or

  1 14 certified by a certification body accredited by the American

  1 26                           EXPLANATION
  1 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 29    This bill relates to the sale, lease, rental, or
  1 30 advertisement of water treatment systems.
  1 31    Under current law, it is an unlawful practice for a person to
  1 32 sell, lease, rent, or advertise the sale, lease, or rental of a
  1 33 water treatment system for which claims or representations of
  1 34 removing health=related contaminants are made, unless the water
  1 35 treatment system is performance tested by a third=party testing
  2  1 agency authorized by the department of public health or the
  2  2 manufacturer tested the system and the manufacturer's data is
  2  3 accepted by a third=party evaluator which was approved by the
  2  4 department of public health; the water treatment system has met
  2  5 the performance testing requirements specified in the testing
  2  6 protocol; the water treatment system bears a label stating,
  2  7 "IMPORTANT NOTICE == Read the Manufacturer's Performance Data
  2  8 Sheet" and is accompanied by the manufacturer's performance
  2  9 data sheet, which includes general information about the

  2 17 against such a person. Code section 714.16 also permits a

  2 19 an unlawful practice.
  2 20    The bill amends the requirements so that the sale, lease,
  2 21 rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system is not an
  2 22 unlawful practice if the claims and representations related
  2 23 to removal of health=related contaminants are certified by
  2 24 a certification body accredited by the American national
  2 25 standards institute and the water treatment system has met
  2 26 the performance testing requirements applicable to that water
  2 27 treatment system as specified by the national sanitation

  2 29 Under the bill, the testing body or agency is not required to

  2 32 of a water treatment system be provided the manufacturer's
  2 33 performance data sheet or a consumer information pamphlet
  2 34 compiled by the department of public health.
  2 35    The bill does not affect Code section 714.16(2)(i) or Code

  3  2 lease, rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system.
  3  3 Under Code section 714.16(2)(i), it is an unlawful practice for

  1 26                           EXPLANATION
  1 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 29    This bill relates to the sale, lease, rental, or
  1 30 advertisement of water treatment systems.
  1 31    Under current law, it is an unlawful practice for a person to
  1 32 sell, lease, rent, or advertise the sale, lease, or rental of a
  1 33 water treatment system for which claims or representations of
  1 34 removing health=related contaminants are made, unless the water
  1 35 treatment system is performance tested by a third=party testing
  2  1 agency authorized by the department of public health or the
  2  2 manufacturer tested the system and the manufacturer's data is
  2  3 accepted by a third=party evaluator which was approved by the
  2  4 department of public health; the water treatment system has met
  2  5 the performance testing requirements specified in the testing
  2  6 protocol; the water treatment system bears a label stating,
  2  7 "IMPORTANT NOTICE == Read the Manufacturer's Performance Data
  2  8 Sheet" and is accompanied by the manufacturer's performance
  2  9 data sheet, which includes general information about the
  2 10 water treatment system and performance and test data showing
  2 11 the contaminants certified to be reduced; and the consumer
  2 12 information pamphlet compiled by the department of public
  2 13 health is included with the water treatment system.
  2 14    Under Code section 714.16, the attorney general may
  2 15 investigate a person the attorney general believes is engaged
  2 16 in an unlawful practice and seek and obtain injunctive relief
  2 17 against such a person. Code section 714.16 also permits a
  2 18 court to impose a civil penalty against a person who committed
  2 19 an unlawful practice.
  2 20    The bill amends the requirements so that the sale, lease,
  2 21 rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system is not an
  2 22 unlawful practice if the claims and representations related
  2 23 to removal of health=related contaminants are certified by
  2 24 a certification body accredited by the American national
  2 25 standards institute and the water treatment system has met
  2 26 the performance testing requirements applicable to that water
  2 27 treatment system as specified by the national sanitation
  2 28 foundation and the American national standards institute.
  2 29 Under the bill, the testing body or agency is not required to
  2 30 be authorized or approved by the department of public health.
  2 31    The bill eliminates the requirements that a consumer
  2 32 of a water treatment system be provided the manufacturer's
  2 33 performance data sheet or a consumer information pamphlet
  2 34 compiled by the department of public health.
  2 35    The bill does not affect Code section 714.16(2)(i) or Code
  3  1 section 714.16(2)(j), both of which also relate to the sale,
  3  2 lease, rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system.
  3  3 Under Code section 714.16(2)(i), it is an unlawful practice for
  3  4 a person to sell, lease, rent, or advertise a water treatment
  3  5 system in this state for which false or deceptive claims or

  3  8 practice for a person to make any representation or claim
  3  9 that the seller's water treatment system has been approved or
  3 10 endorsed by any agency of the state.
  3 11    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016, and applies to the sales,
