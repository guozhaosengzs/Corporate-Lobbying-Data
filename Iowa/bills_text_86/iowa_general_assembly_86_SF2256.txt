  6  1                           EXPLANATION
  6  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  4    This bill relates to voter registration by allowing
  6  5 registration of eligible electors to vote following review
  6  6 of electronic records received from driver's license and
  6  7 nonoperator's identification card applications by county
  6  8 commissioners of registration (county auditors).
  6  9    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  6 10 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  6 11 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  6 12 the legal name, date of birth, residential address, mailing
  6 13 address, and social security number for each person submitting
  6 14 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  6 15 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  6 16 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  6 17 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  6 18 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  6 19 social security number, and other information. Under current
  6 20 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  6 21 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  6 22 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  6 23 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  6 24 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  6 25 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  6 26 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  6 27 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  6 28 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  6 29 state department of transportation.
  6 30    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to
  6 31 transmit the electronic records to the county commissioner of
  6 32 registration of the county where the person resides. The bill
  6 33 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 34 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  6 35 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  1 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  2 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  3 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  4 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  5 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  6 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  7 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  8 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7  9 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 10 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 11 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 12 current law.
  7 13    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 14 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 15 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 16 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 17 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 18 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 19 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 20 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 21 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 22 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 23 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 24 for submitting such an application.
  7 25    The bill also grants the state voter registration
  7 26 commission, in consultation with the department of
  7 27 transportation, the authority to adopt rules to administer
  7 28 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 29 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations.  If
  7 30 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 31 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 32 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 33 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 34 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  7 35 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  1 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  2 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  3 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8  4    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8  5 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 9E by
  8  6 requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for administration
  8  7 of registration for those participants.
  8  8    The bill specifies that a requirement that separate
  8  9 registration forms be signed by each individual registrant only
  8 10 applies to paper registration forms.
  8 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 12 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 13 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 14 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 15 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 16 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 17 mandate included in the bill.

  6 27 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  6 28 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the

  6 30    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to
  6 31 transmit the electronic records to the county commissioner of
  6 32 registration of the county where the person resides. The bill
  6 33 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 34 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  6 35 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  1 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is

  7  3 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  4 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  5 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  6 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  7 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  8 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7  9 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 10 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 11 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 12 current law.
  7 13    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 14 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 15 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 16 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 17 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 18 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 19 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 20 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 21 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 22 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 23 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 24 for submitting such an application.
  7 25    The bill also grants the state voter registration

  6 33 requires that the county commissioner review the electronic
  6 34 record and any other relevant information to determine if a
  6 35 person is an eligible elector. If the county commissioner
  7  1 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  2 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  3 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  4 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  5 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  6 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  7 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  8 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7  9 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 10 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 11 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 12 current law.
  7 13    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 14 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
  7 15 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
  7 16 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
  7 17 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
  7 18 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
  7 19 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify
  7 20 as an eligible elector does not constitute a completed voter
  7 21 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 22 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 23 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 24 for submitting such an application.
  7 25    The bill also grants the state voter registration
  7 26 commission, in consultation with the department of
  7 27 transportation, the authority to adopt rules to administer
  7 28 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 29 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations.  If
  7 30 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 31 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 32 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 33 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 34 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  7 35 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  1 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  2 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  3 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
  8  4    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
  8  5 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter 9E by
  8  6 requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for administration
  8  7 of registration for those participants.
  8  8    The bill specifies that a requirement that separate
  8  9 registration forms be signed by each individual registrant only
  8 10 applies to paper registration forms.
  8 11    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 12 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 13 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 14 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 15 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 16 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 17 mandate included in the bill.

  7  1 determines a person to be an eligible elector and the person is
  7  2 not registered to vote in the county, the county commissioner
  7  3 is required to notify the person of the separate processes to
  7  4 decline to register to vote or to declare a political party
  7  5 affiliation. If a notified person fails to decline voter
  7  6 registration within 21 days after the county commissioner
  7  7 issued the notification, the bill provides that the electronic
  7  8 record and electronic signature shall constitute a completed
  7  9 voter registration form for that person and the bill requires
  7 10 the county commissioner to register the person to vote in that
  7 11 county and send the person an acknowledgment as required by
  7 12 current law.
  7 13    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
  7 14 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21

  7 19 that the electronic record of a person who does not qualify

  7 21 registration form. Under the bill, such a person submitting
  7 22 an application for a license or card will not be subject to
  7 23 charges for voter registration fraud under Code section 39A.2
  7 24 for submitting such an application.

  7 28 and interpret the provisions of the bill relating to voter
  7 29 registration at motor vehicle driver's license stations.  If
  7 30 interpretive rulemaking authority is clearly vested in the
  7 31 discretion of an agency by statute, the applicable judicial
  7 32 standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
  7 33 irrational, illogical, or wholly unjustifiable interpretation
  7 34 of law by the agency (Code section 17A.19(10)(l)). If
  7 35 interpretive rulemaking authority is not clearly vested in
  8  1 the discretion of an agency, the applicable judicial standard
  8  2 of review is whether the rules constitute an erroneous
  8  3 interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
