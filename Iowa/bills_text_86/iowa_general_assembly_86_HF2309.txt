 15 10 chapter 124,  15 10 chapter 124,  15 11 board.
 15 12    Sec. 42.  REPEAL.  Chapter 124A, Code 2016, is repealed.
 15 13                           EXPLANATION
 15 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 12    Sec. 42.  REPEAL.  Chapter 124A, Code 2016, is repealed.
 15 13                           EXPLANATION
 15 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 13                           EXPLANATION
 15 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).
       LSB 5168HV (3) 86
       jm/nh
 15 16    This bill relates to controlled substances, including by
 15 17 enhancing the penalties for imitation controlled substances,
 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,

 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 18 modifying the controlled substances listed in schedules I,
 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 19 III, IV, and temporarily designating substances as controlled
 15 20 substances.
 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 21    TEMPORARY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE DESIGNATION.  Under current
 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 22 law and in the bill, the board of pharmacy may designate a new
 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 23 substance as a controlled substance, by administrative rule,
 15 24 without the general assembly amending Code chapter 124, only
 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than

 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 25 if the substance is designated as a controlled substance under
 15 26 federal law.
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section

 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).
       LSB 5168HV (3) 86
       jm/nh
 15 27    If the board of pharmacy designates a substance as
 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 28 controlled, the bill specifies that the temporary designation
 15 29 is considered a temporary amendment to the schedules of
 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two

 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 30 controlled substances in Code chapter 124, and if the general
 15 31 assembly does not amend Code chapter 124 to enact the  temporary
 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense

 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an

 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 32 amendment and make the enactment effective within two years
 15 33 from the date the temporary amendment first became effective,
 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical

 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 15 34 the temporary amendment is repealed by operation of law two
 15 35 years from the effective date of the temporary amendment.  A
 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 35 committing such violations.

 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  1 temporary amendment repealed by operation of law is subject to
 16  2 Code section 4.13 relating to the construction of statutes and
 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.

 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.

 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.

 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a

 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance

 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  3 the application of a general savings provision.
 16  4    Current law provides that if within 60 days after the next
 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  5 general assembly convenes the general assembly has not made
 16  6 the corresponding changes in Code chapter 124, the temporary
 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.

 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.

 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a

 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  7 designation that the substance is a controlled substance is
 16  8 nullified.
 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that

 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or

 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section

 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16  9    COCAINE BASE AND COCAINE.  The bill increases the amounts of
 16 10 controlled substances containing cocaine base (crack cocaine)
 16 11 that determine the criminal penalty for certain offenses.
 16 12 Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers,
 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance

 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or

 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a

 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled

 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 13 or possesses with the intent to deliver a controlled substance
 16 14 containing cocaine base, or unlawfully acts with, enters into
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).
       LSB 5168HV (3) 86
       jm/nh
 16 15 a common scheme or design with, or conspires with one or more
 16 16 persons to manufacture, deliver, or possess such a controlled
 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 17 substance, the person commits the following offenses: a class
 16 18 "B" felony punishable by confinement of no more than 50 years
 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging

 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic

 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a

 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical

 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in

 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an

 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 19 and a fine of not more than $1 million if the controlled
 16 20 substance containing cocaine base is more than 125 grams rather
 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears

 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully

 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable

 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 21 than the current 50 grams; a class "B" felony punishable by
 16 22 confinement of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than
 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled

 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone

 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section

 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 23 $5,000 but not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled
 16 24 substance is more than 35 grams but not more than 125 grams
 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled

 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears

 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an

 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully

 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or

 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be

 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 25 rather than the current 10 to 50 grams; or a class "C" felony
 16 26 punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000 but not more than
 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation

 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical

 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a

 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 27 $50,000 if the controlled substance containing cocaine base
 16 28 is 35 grams or less rather than the current 10 grams or less.
 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,

 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully

 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or

 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.

 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the

 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation

 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).

 16 29 However, the bill makes it a class "D" felony for a first
 16 30 offense violation involving less than three grams of a mixture
 16 31 or substance which contains cocaine base.
 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 16 32    The bill also makes it a class "D" felony for a first offense
 16 33 violation involving less than three grams of the following:
 16 34 coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves
 16 35 from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecgonine and
 17  1 their salts have been removed; cocaine, its salts, optical
 17  2 and geometric isomers, or salts of isomers; or ecgonine, its
 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of

 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for

 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or

 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or

 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  3 derivatives, their salts, isomers, or salts of isomers.
 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  4    IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  Under current law
 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  5 imitation controlled substances are regulated under Code
 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may

 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a

 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).

 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  6 chapter 124A.  The bill repeals Code chapter 124A and transfers
 17  7 the regulation of imitation controlled substances to Code
 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.

 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17  8 chapter 124.  The definition and designation of an imitation
 17  9 controlled substance in Code chapter 124 remains identical
 17 10 to the definition and designation of an imitation controlled
 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17 11 substance under current law in Code chapter 124A.
 17 12    Under the bill and in current law, an imitation controlled
 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully

 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that

 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to

 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section

 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section
 21  7 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new stimulant
 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17 13 substance means a substance which is not a controlled substance
 17 14 but by color, shape, size, markings, and other aspects of
 17 15 dosage unit appearance, and packaging or other factors, appears
 17 16 to be or resembles a controlled substance. The board of
 17 17 pharmacy may designate a substance as an imitation controlled
 17 18 substance pursuant to the board's rulemaking authority and in
 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or
 19 13 nonpublic school, may be sentenced up to an additional term of
 19 14 confinement of five years in addition to any other penalty.
 19 15    The amendment to Code section 124.401B provides that
 19 16 a person who unlawfully possesses an imitation controlled
 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is
 20  5 at least three years younger than the violator, commits an
 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18
 20  9 years of age discovered to be in possession of an imitation
 20 10 controlled substance, and if the person is not referred to
 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the

 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in

 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule
 21  6 I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under Code section

 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of
 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under
 21  3 Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation involves the new
 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as

 17 19 accordance with Code chapter 17A.
 17 20    In addition, under current law and in the bill, if a
 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance
 17 32 when sold.
 17 33    Under the bill, if a person unlawfully manufactures,
 17 34 delivers, or possesses with the intent to deliver an imitation
 17 35 controlled substance containing any detectable amount of those
 18  1 substances identified in Code section 124.204(9), or unlawfully
 18  2 acts with, enters into a common scheme or design with, or
 18  3 conspires with one or more persons to manufacture, deliver,
 18  4 or possess such imitation controlled substances, the person
 18  5 commits the following offense: a class "B" felony punishable
 18  6 by confinement of no more than 50 years and a fine of not more
 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement
 18  9 of no more than 25 years and a fine of not less than $5,000 but
 18 10 not more than $100,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 11 is more than five kilograms but not more than 10 kilograms; a
 18 12 class "C" felony punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000
 18 13 but not more than $50,000 if the imitation controlled substance
 18 14 is five kilograms or less; or an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 18 15 imitation controlled substance is classified in schedule IV or
 18 16 V; or a serious misdemeanor for a first possession offense,
 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if
 18 20 a person unlawfully manufactures, delivers, or possesses with
 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"
 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.
 18 35    The bill provides that if the same person commits two or
 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the
 19  3 acts are attributable to a single scheme, the acts may be
 19  4 considered a single violation and the weights of the imitation
 19  5 controlled substance may be combined for purposes of charging
 19  6 the offender.
 19  7    The amendment to Code section 124.401A provides that
 19  8 a person who is 18 years of age or older who unlawfully
 19  9 manufactures with the intent to distribute, distributes,
 19 10 or possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation
 19 11 controlled substance to another person 18 years of age or older
 19 12 within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a public or

 19 20 service.
 19 21    The amendments to Code section 124.406 relate to the
 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic
 19 31 school, public park, public pool, or public recreation center.
 19 32 A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 33 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to be
 19 34 a substance listed in schedule III, to a person under 18 years
 19 35 of age, who is at least three years younger than the violator,
 20  1 commits a class "C" felony.  A person who distributes or
 20  2 possesses with the intent to distribute an imitation controlled
 20  3 substance, represented to be a substance listed in schedule
 20  4 IV or schedule V, to a person under 18 years of age, who is

 20 11 juvenile court, the peace officer shall make a reasonable
 20 12 effort to notify the person's custodial parent of the
 20 13 possession unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe
 20 14 such notification is not in the best interests of the person.
 20 15 The bill specifies that if the person is taken into custody
 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or
 20 18 nonpublic school of the taking into custody of the person.
 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered

 18 25 felony.  In addition, under current law, if a person unlawfully
 18 26 and knowingly publishes an advertisement or distributes in a
 18 27 public place a promotion for an imitation controlled substance
 18 28 the person commits a serious misdemeanor.
 18 29    The bill enhances the criminal penalties for controlled
 18 30 substances classified in Code sections 124.204(4)(ai) and
 18 31 124.204(6)(i) from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "C"
 18 32 felony punishable pursuant to Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8).
 18 33 This change equalizes the criminal penalties with violations
 18 34 involving other schedule I controlled substances.

 19  1 more acts which are in violation of Code section 124.401(1)
 19  2 and the acts occur in the same location or time period so the

 19 17 substance within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a
 19 18 school, public park, public pool, public recreation center, or
 19 19 marked school bus may be sentenced up to 100 hours of community
 19 20 service.

 19 22 distribution or possession with the intent to distribute an
 19 23 imitation controlled substance to a person under 18 years of
 19 24 age.  A person who distributes or possesses with the intent to
 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic

 20  6 aggravated misdemeanor.
 20  7    The amendment to Code section 124.415 requires that a peace
 20  8 officer make a reasonable effort to identify a person under 18

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to
 20 17 identify the school of attendance and to notify the school or

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do
 20 24 such activities, if the person uses the imitation controlled
 20 25 substance for use as a placebo by a registered practitioner in
 20 26 the court of professional practice or research.
 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 21 10 "other substances" under schedule I.  A person commits a class
 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 17 21 substance has not been designated as an imitation controlled
 17 22 substance by the board of pharmacy and when dosage unit
 17 23 appearance alone does not establish that a substance is an
 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value

 18 17 an aggravated misdemeanor for a second possession offense,
 18 18 or a class "D" felony for two or more previous possession
 18 19 offenses. Current law in Code section 124A.4 provides that if

 18 21 intent to deliver an imitation controlled substance, the person
 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 17 24 imitation controlled substance, the following factors may
 17 25 be considered in determining whether the substance is an
 17 26 imitation controlled substance: the substance is represented
 17 27 as having the effect of a controlled substance; the substance
 17 28 is represented as a controlled substance or as a substitute for
 17 29 a controlled substance because of its nature or appearance;
 17 30 or a person receives money or other property having a value
 17 31 substantially greater than the actual value of the substance

 18  7 than $1 million if the imitation controlled substance is more
 18  8 than 10 kilograms; a class "B" felony punishable by confinement

 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within

 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule

 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"

 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies

 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section

 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance

 20 27    SCHEDULE I, III, AND IV CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.  The bill
 20 28 transfers numerous substances classified as "hallucinogenic
 20 29 substances" under schedule I and reclassifies the substances
 20 30 as "other substances" under schedule I.  By transferring the
 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits
 20 34 an aggravated misdemeanor under Code section 124.401(1)(d) when
 20 35 committing such violations.
 21  1 The bill adds new substances as "hallucinogenic substances"
 21  2 under schedule I.  A person commits a class "C" felony under

 21  4 hallucinogenic substances.
 21  5    The bill adds new substances as "stimulants" under schedule

 21  8 substances.
 21  9    The bill also adds new substances to the classification of

 21 11 "C" felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) for a violation
 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies
 21 15 the substance as a "stimulant" containing a synthetic cathinone
 21 16 under schedule I.  The transfer of the substance within
 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
 21 21 in Code section 124.204(6)(i)(3) from schedule I and does not
 21 22 reclassify the substance in any other substance schedule.
 21 23    The bill also removes numerous substances from schedule I
 21 24 which are currently classified as "stimulants" in Code section
 21 25 124.204(6)(i).
 21 26    The bill also strikes two narcotic substances from schedule
 21 27 III and adds three substances to schedule IV.  A violation
 21 28 involving a schedule IV controlled substance is punishable as
 21 29 an aggravated misdemeanor in Code section 124.401(1)(d).

 18 22 commits an aggravated misdemeanor, or if the person delivers
 18 23 to a person under 18 years of age who is at least three years
 18 24 younger than the violator, the person commits a class "D"

 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required
 19 28 penalty for such a violation is a minimum term of confinement
 19 29 of 10 years if the substance was distributed within 1,000
 19 30 feet of the real property comprising a public or nonpublic

 19 25 distribute an imitation controlled substance, represented to
 19 26 be a substance listed in schedule I or schedule II, to a person
 19 27 under 18 years of age commits a class "B" felony. The required

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the

 20 16 the juvenile court officer shall make a reasonable effort to

 20 19    The bill creates Code section 124.417, which is similar to
 20 20 Code section 124A.5 repealed by the bill.  A person registered
 20 21 under Code section 124.302 does not violate the bill if the
 20 22 person manufactures, delivers, possesses, or possesses with the
 20 23 intent to manufacture or deliver, or acts with others to do

 20 31 substances to "other substances", a person commits a class "C"
 20 32 felony under Code section 124.401(1)(c)(8) if the violation
 20 33 involves such a substance. Under current law, a person commits

 21 12 involving the new substances.
 21 13    The bill strikes one substance classified as a
 21 14 "hallucinogenic substance" under schedule I and reclassifies

 21 17 schedule I also changes the criminal penalty for a violation
 21 18 involving the substance from a class "C" felony under Code
 21 19 section 124.401(1)(c)(8) to an aggravated misdemeanor under
 21 20 Code section 124.401(1)(d).  The bill also strikes a substance
