 25 15                           EXPLANATION
 25 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 25 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 25 18    This bill requires the superintendent of the banking
 25 19 division of the department of commerce to regulate appraisal
 25 20 management companies and modifies provisions applicable to the
 25 21 Iowa real estate appraiser examining board.
 25 22    The bill provides definitions relating to the regulation of
 25 23 appraisal management companies (AMCs).
 25 24    The bill prohibits a person from conducting business or
 25 25 advertising itself as an AMC without first registering with the
 25 26 administrator, defined as the superintendent of banking.
 25 27    The bill requires an AMC to designate a controlling person
 25 28 to be the main contact between the administrator and the AMC
 25 29 and to be responsible for compliance with the bill. The
 25 30 controlling person and any person who owns more than 10 percent
 25 31 of an AMC must be found to be of good moral character and submit
 25 32 to a background investigation.
 25 33    The bill requires that the AMC application for registration
 25 34 and registration renewal contain its contact information,
 25 35 agent for service of process, owners, controlling person,
 26  1 appraiser panel, appraisers, and appraisal management
 26  2 services, information to assure compliance with the uniform
 26  3 standards of professional appraisal practice (USPAP), and
 26  4 any other additional information needed as determined by
 26  5 the administrator. The administrator may require periodic
 26  6 disclosures of changes impacting registration.
 26  7    The bill requires the administrator to establish fees
 26  8 by rule. All fees shall be deposited into the department
 26  9 of commerce revolving fund and are appropriated to the
 26 10 administrator. Appropriated moneys are not subject to
 26 11 reversion to the state general fund.
 26 12    The bill requires an AMC to ensure that its appraisers
 26 13 comply with USPAP and implement a review system to monitor such
 26 14 compliance. An AMC that has a reasonable basis to believe
 26 15 that an appraiser or another AMC has failed to comply with
 26 16 applicable law shall refer the matter to the administrator. An
 26 17 appraiser in the appraiser panel of an AMC who has a reasonable
 26 18 basis to believe the AMC is in violation of the bill shall
 26 19 refer the matter to the administrator.
 26 20    The bill requires an AMC to keep a detailed record of all
 26 21 its appraiser services and the identity of the appraiser who
 26 22 performed the service for at least five years. An AMC must pay
 26 23 an appraiser for the completion of an appraiser service within
 26 24 45 days of completion and keep detailed records of payment for
 26 25 at least five years.
 26 26    The bill requires an AMC to take all reasonable steps to
 26 27 assure that appraisals are conducted independently and without
 26 28 inappropriate influence or coercion pursuant to federal and
 26 29 state law. An AMC must compensate appraisers at a reasonable
 26 30 and customary rate.
 26 31    The bill prohibits an AMC, or an employee or other agent
 26 32 of an AMC, from doing any of the following: requiring an
 26 33 appraiser to indemnify an AMC for liability for the services
 26 34 performed by the AMC; modifying a completed appraisal
 26 35 report without the appraiser's written consent; requiring an
 27  1 appraiser to provide the appraiser's identification or security
 27  2 information to an AMC other than to affix on a completed
 27  3 appraisal report; removing an appraiser from an appraiser
 27  4 panel without written notice; requiring an appraiser to modify
 27  5 an appraiser report other than what is permitted under Code
 27  6 chapter 543D; requiring an appraiser to perform an appraisal
 27  7 if the appraiser notified the AMC that the appraiser does not
 27  8 have the necessary competence or the timeframe is insufficient;
 27  9 requiring an appraiser to violate USPAP or Code chapter 543D
 27 10 or its implementing rules; prohibiting an appraiser from
 27 11 disclosing the appraiser's fee; prohibiting communications
 27 12 relevant to an appraisal; conditioning payment to an appraiser
 27 13 on a loan closing, a specific dollar amount, an outcome that
 27 14 would violate Code section 543D.18(2), or 543D.18A(1); or
 27 15 engaging in any acts or practices that violate Code section
 27 16 543E.14.
 27 17    The bill authorizes the administrator to discipline an AMC
 27 18 for fraud or deceit in obtaining registration, dishonesty, or
 27 19 gross negligence in providing appraisal management services;
 27 20 violating the bill; being convicted of a felony related to
 27 21 fraud or appraisal management services; being disciplined
 27 22 to practice as an AMC in any jurisdiction for a substantive
 27 23 reason; or violating Code section 272C.10. The board may,
 27 24 after notice and hearing, revoke, suspend, or refuse to issue,
 27 25 renew, or reinstate a registration; reprimand, censure, or
 27 26 limit the scope of practice of a registrant; impose a civil
 27 27 penalty of no more than $10,000 per violation; require remedial
 27 28 action; or place an AMC on probation.
 27 29    The bill allows the administrator to seek an injunction
 27 30 from the district court upon belief that a person has or is
 27 31 about to engage in a violation of the bill. The administrator
 27 32 is authorized to investigate or initiate complaints against
 27 33 nonregistered persons. The administrator is also authorized
 27 34 to issue an order to a person not registered and may impose a
 27 35 civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation of Code
 28  1 section 543E.4 or 543D.18A(1), or fraud or deceit in applying
 28  2 for registration. All civil penalties shall be deposited in
 28  3 the housing trust fund created in Code section 16.181.
 28  4    The bill requires an AMC to be covered by a surety bond in
 28  5 the amount of $25,000 to cover liabilities, damages, losses, or
 28  6 claims arising out of the AMC's appraisal management services
 28  7 in this state.
 28  8    The bill provides the administrator with broad authority
 28  9 to implement the bill and adopt necessary rules. The
 28 10 administrator may also conduct periodic examinations of
 28 11 registrants, adopt rules governing an appraiser's use of
 28 12 associate real estate appraisers, and require criminal history
 28 13 and background investigations.
 28 14    The bill provides the superintendent of banking with
 28 15 supervisory authority over the real estate appraiser board
 28 16 established in Code chapter 543D to regulate real estate
 28 17 appraisers. The superintendent shall independently evaluate
 28 18 the actions of the board and have the authority to review,
 28 19 approve, modify, or reject a board action. The superintendent
 28 20 shall also manage the board's budget and retained fees.
 28 21    The bill makes several changes to current law to provide
 28 22 the superintendent with regulatory authority over AMCs and
 28 23 supervisory authority over the real estate appraiser board.
 28 24    The bill adds the superintendent to the list of defined
 28 25 licensing boards in Code section 272C.1. The bill subjects
 28 26 the real estate appraiser board's rulemaking authority
 28 27 to the supervision of the superintendent in  Code section
 28 28 543D.5. The bill applies Code sections 546.10, subsections
 28 29 6 through 12, to the appraiser board in Code section 543D.5,
 28 30 to provide the professional licensing and regulation bureau
 28 31 with regulatory powers over the appraiser board. The bill
 28 32 requires the appraiser board's collected fees to be deposited
 28 33 in the department of commerce revolving fund created in Code
 28 34 section 546.12 and are appropriated to the superintendent
 28 35 on behalf of the board  in Code section 543D.6. The bill
 29  1 expands the appraiser board's authority to require background
 29  2 investigations in Code section 543D.22, subsection 1. The
 29  3 bill adds real estate appraisers under Code chapter 543D and
 29  4 AMCs under Code chapter 543E to the list of professions or
 29  5 entities regulated by the banking division in Code section
