  1 10 of natural resources, and any other federal or state agency or
  1 11 entity the board determines appropriate, shall measure current
  1 12 and flow levels at designated locations along the rivers to
  1 13 assess potential energy generation capacity. The board shall
  1 14 submit a report of its assessment, including a proposed number
  1 15 of hydroelectric energy production facilities and potential
  1 16 locations, to the general assembly by January 1, 2016.
