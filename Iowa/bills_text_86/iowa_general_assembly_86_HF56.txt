  5 16                           EXPLANATION
  5 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 19    Current law requires the use of lighted headlamps and
  5 20 certain other lighting devices at any time from sunset to
  5 21 sunrise, and at such other times when conditions such as fog,
  5 22 snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting to render
  5 23 clearly discernible persons and vehicles on the highway at a
  5 24 distance of 500 feet ahead.
  5 25    The bill requires motor vehicles to display lighted
  5 26 headlamps at all times of operation on a roadway or shoulder.
  5 27 The scheduled fine for a violation of this provision remains
  5 28 $30. The bill also requires that, where ambient sunlight is of
  5 29 sufficient intensity to reveal persons and vehicles at a safe
  5 30 distance in advance of the vehicle without the use of lighting
  5 31 devices, the lowermost distribution of light or composite beam
  5 32 shall be used. The scheduled fine for a violation of this
  5 33 provision remains $30.
