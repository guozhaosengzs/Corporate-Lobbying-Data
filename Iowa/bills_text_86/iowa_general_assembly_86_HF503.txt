  1 27    GENERAL.  This bill provides that certain show animals are
  1 28 not to be counted when computing the animal capacity of an
  1 29 animal feeding operation regulated by the department of natural
  1 30 resources. In order to not to be counted, the animal must
  1 31 be entered in a program or project sponsored by 4=H or the
  1 32 national FFA organization or one of its chapters, such as an
  1 33 exhibition, contest, or fair event.
  1 34    BACKGROUND.   The applicability and scope of regulation often
  1 35 depends upon the size of an animal feeding operation which
  2  1 is either measured by animal weight capacity or animal unit
  2  2 capacity. An animal feeding operation is an area in which
  2  3 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or
  2  4 fish) are maintained for at least 45 days. Animal weight
  2  5 capacity is the average weight of all animals in a confinement
  2  6 feeding operation when the operation is at full animal
  2  7 capacity.  Animal unit capacity is determined by multiplying
  2  8 the maximum number of each category of animal species that may
  2  9 be confined at one time by an equivalency factor assigned to
  2 10 that category and then adding those sums together.

  1 34    BACKGROUND.   The applicability and scope of regulation often
  1 35 depends upon the size of an animal feeding operation which
  2  1 is either measured by animal weight capacity or animal unit
  2  2 capacity. An animal feeding operation is an area in which
  2  3 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or
  2  4 fish) are maintained for at least 45 days. Animal weight
  2  5 capacity is the average weight of all animals in a confinement
  2  6 feeding operation when the operation is at full animal
  2  7 capacity.  Animal unit capacity is determined by multiplying
  2  8 the maximum number of each category of animal species that may
  2  9 be confined at one time by an equivalency factor assigned to
  2 10 that category and then adding those sums together.
