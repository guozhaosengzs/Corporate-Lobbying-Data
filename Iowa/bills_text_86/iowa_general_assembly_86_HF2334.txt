 10 25 insurance to retain the prescription certificate or the
 10 26 conditional prescription certificate.
 10 27    The bill provides that a prescribing psychologist or

 11 13    The bill instructs the board of psychology in consultation

 11 21 pharmacy with an annual list of prescribing psychologists and
 11 22 psychologists with conditional prescription certificates and
