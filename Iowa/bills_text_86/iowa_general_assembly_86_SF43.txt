  1  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  9    This bill increases the speed limit from 55 to 60 miles per
  1 10 hour on hard surface roads that are not subject to other speed
  1 11 restrictions.  The new speed limit applies on primary roads
  1 12 other than certain divided, multilaned highways with a speed
  1 13 limit of 65 miles per hour and on interstates, where the speed
  1 14 limit is typically 70 miles per hour.  The new speed limit also
  1 15 applies on secondary roads surfaced with concrete or asphalt.
  1 16 Under the bill, the department of transportation retains the
  1 17 authority to lower the speed limit on any part of the primary
  1 18 road system, and counties retain the right to lower the speed
  1 19 limit on secondary roads.
