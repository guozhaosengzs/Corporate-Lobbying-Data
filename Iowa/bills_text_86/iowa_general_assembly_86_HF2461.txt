  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 18 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 19 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
  9 20 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  It also relates to
  9 21 the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
  9 22 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
  9 23 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
  9 24 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
  9 25 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
  9 26 attorney general.
  9 27    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ==
  9 28 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
  9 29 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
  9 30 significant soil loss for land located within their district,
  9 31 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
  9 32 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
  9 33 a soil loss limit which shall be not more than five tons during
  9 34 any 12=month period.  The regulation establishing a soil loss
  9 35 limit is no longer required to be approved by the committee.
 10  1 The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10  2 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10  3 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection, the
 10  4 commissioners must issue an administrative order against a
 10  5 person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds the
 10  6 soil loss limit. The order must describe the commissioners'
 10  7 findings, be delivered to the person responsible for causing
 10  8 the soil loss, and establish a period for compliance with
 10  9 the order. Evidence of compliance with the order includes
 10 10 applying for public moneys, such as cost=share financing,
 10 11 in order to defray a portion of the costs associated with
 10 12 complying with the order.  The bill requires the commissioners
 10 13 to give preference to applications which seek to comply with
 10 14 an administrative order.
 10 15    After the compliance period expires, if no work to comply
 10 16 with the order is being performed, the commissioners must
 10 17 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 10 18 general or the board in the county in which the land is
 10 19 located. A person whose land is damaged due to neighboring
 10 20 land's erosion may also petition the board to enforce the
 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs
 10 23 associated with taking its action. The treasurer must enter
 10 24 an amount equal to the costs plus a 5 percent penalty on the
 10 25 tax books, which shall be collected as ordinary taxes and
 10 26 constitutes a lien against the property. However, the board
 10 27 may instead refer the matter to the attorney general. The
 10 28 commissioners, or the board or attorney general acting under
 10 29 a referral, must petition the district court to enforce the
 10 30 order.

 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs

  9 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 18 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 19 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
  9 20 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  It also relates to
  9 21 the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
  9 22 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
  9 23 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
  9 24 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
  9 25 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
  9 26 attorney general.
  9 27    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ==
  9 28 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
  9 29 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
  9 30 significant soil loss for land located within their district,
  9 31 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
  9 32 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
  9 33 a soil loss limit which shall be not more than five tons during
  9 34 any 12=month period.  The regulation establishing a soil loss
  9 35 limit is no longer required to be approved by the committee.
 10  1 The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10  2 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10  3 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection, the
 10  4 commissioners must issue an administrative order against a
 10  5 person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds the
 10  6 soil loss limit. The order must describe the commissioners'
 10  7 findings, be delivered to the person responsible for causing
 10  8 the soil loss, and establish a period for compliance with
 10  9 the order. Evidence of compliance with the order includes
 10 10 applying for public moneys, such as cost=share financing,
 10 11 in order to defray a portion of the costs associated with
 10 12 complying with the order.  The bill requires the commissioners
 10 13 to give preference to applications which seek to comply with
 10 14 an administrative order.
 10 15    After the compliance period expires, if no work to comply
 10 16 with the order is being performed, the commissioners must
 10 17 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 10 18 general or the board in the county in which the land is
 10 19 located. A person whose land is damaged due to neighboring
 10 20 land's erosion may also petition the board to enforce the
 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs
 10 23 associated with taking its action. The treasurer must enter
 10 24 an amount equal to the costs plus a 5 percent penalty on the
 10 25 tax books, which shall be collected as ordinary taxes and
 10 26 constitutes a lien against the property. However, the board
 10 27 may instead refer the matter to the attorney general. The
 10 28 commissioners, or the board or attorney general acting under
 10 29 a referral, must petition the district court to enforce the
 10 30 order.

  9 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 17    GENERAL.  This bill relates to the powers and duties of
  9 18 the five soil commissioners who govern each soil and water
  9 19 conservation district (district) and who are elected to serve
  9 20 four=year terms on a nonpartisan basis.  It also relates to
  9 21 the powers and duties of a number of other state and local
  9 22 entities, including county boards of supervisors (boards),
  9 23 county treasurers, the state soil conservation committee
  9 24 (committee), the soil conservation division of the department
  9 25 of agriculture and land stewardship (division), and the
  9 26 attorney general.
  9 27    COMMISSIONERS, BOARDS, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ==
  9 28 ESTABLISHING AND ENFORCING SOIL LOSS LIMITS.  The commissioners
  9 29 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
  9 30 significant soil loss for land located within their district,
  9 31 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
  9 32 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
  9 33 a soil loss limit which shall be not more than five tons during
  9 34 any 12=month period.  The regulation establishing a soil loss
  9 35 limit is no longer required to be approved by the committee.
 10  1 The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10  2 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10  3 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection, the
 10  4 commissioners must issue an administrative order against a
 10  5 person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds the
 10  6 soil loss limit. The order must describe the commissioners'
 10  7 findings, be delivered to the person responsible for causing
 10  8 the soil loss, and establish a period for compliance with
 10  9 the order. Evidence of compliance with the order includes
 10 10 applying for public moneys, such as cost=share financing,
 10 11 in order to defray a portion of the costs associated with
 10 12 complying with the order.  The bill requires the commissioners
 10 13 to give preference to applications which seek to comply with
 10 14 an administrative order.
 10 15    After the compliance period expires, if no work to comply
 10 16 with the order is being performed, the commissioners must
 10 17 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 10 18 general or the board in the county in which the land is
 10 19 located. A person whose land is damaged due to neighboring
 10 20 land's erosion may also petition the board to enforce the
 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs
 10 23 associated with taking its action. The treasurer must enter
 10 24 an amount equal to the costs plus a 5 percent penalty on the
 10 25 tax books, which shall be collected as ordinary taxes and
 10 26 constitutes a lien against the property. However, the board
 10 27 may instead refer the matter to the attorney general. The

  9 29 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
  9 30 significant soil loss for land located within their district,
  9 31 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
  9 32 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
  9 33 a soil loss limit which shall be not more than five tons during
  9 34 any 12=month period.  The regulation establishing a soil loss
  9 35 limit is no longer required to be approved by the committee.
 10  1 The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10  2 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10  3 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection, the
 10  4 commissioners must issue an administrative order against a
 10  5 person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds the
 10  6 soil loss limit. The order must describe the commissioners'
 10  7 findings, be delivered to the person responsible for causing
 10  8 the soil loss, and establish a period for compliance with
 10  9 the order. Evidence of compliance with the order includes
 10 10 applying for public moneys, such as cost=share financing,
 10 11 in order to defray a portion of the costs associated with
 10 12 complying with the order.  The bill requires the commissioners
 10 13 to give preference to applications which seek to comply with
 10 14 an administrative order.
 10 15    After the compliance period expires, if no work to comply
 10 16 with the order is being performed, the commissioners must
 10 17 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney

 10 19 located. A person whose land is damaged due to neighboring
 10 20 land's erosion may also petition the board to enforce the
 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs
 10 23 associated with taking its action. The treasurer must enter
 10 24 an amount equal to the costs plus a 5 percent penalty on the
 10 25 tax books, which shall be collected as ordinary taxes and
 10 26 constitutes a lien against the property. However, the board

  9 29 are to establish criteria for determining what constitutes
  9 30 significant soil loss for land located within their district,
  9 31 including soil loss caused by erosion occurring on neighboring
  9 32 land. The commissioners are to adopt a regulation establishing
  9 33 a soil loss limit which shall be not more than five tons during
  9 34 any 12=month period.  The regulation establishing a soil loss
  9 35 limit is no longer required to be approved by the committee.
 10  1 The commissioners must perform an inspection of land located
 10  2 in their district after receipt of a written complaint or upon
 10  3 a majority vote at an open meeting. After the inspection, the
 10  4 commissioners must issue an administrative order against a
 10  5 person if the commissioners find the loss of soil exceeds the
 10  6 soil loss limit. The order must describe the commissioners'
 10  7 findings, be delivered to the person responsible for causing
 10  8 the soil loss, and establish a period for compliance with
 10  9 the order. Evidence of compliance with the order includes
 10 10 applying for public moneys, such as cost=share financing,
 10 11 in order to defray a portion of the costs associated with
 10 12 complying with the order.  The bill requires the commissioners
 10 13 to give preference to applications which seek to comply with

 10 15    After the compliance period expires, if no work to comply
 10 16 with the order is being performed, the commissioners must
 10 17 enforce the order by referring the matter to the attorney
 10 18 general or the board in the county in which the land is
 10 19 located. A person whose land is damaged due to neighboring
 10 20 land's erosion may also petition the board to enforce the
 10 21 order. If the board takes action to enforce compliance with
 10 22 the order, the board must notify the treasurer of the costs
 10 23 associated with taking its action. The treasurer must enter
 10 24 an amount equal to the costs plus a 5 percent penalty on the
 10 25 tax books, which shall be collected as ordinary taxes and
 10 26 constitutes a lien against the property. However, the board
