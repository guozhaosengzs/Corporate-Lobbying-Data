  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for an adjustment in the assessed value
  5 34 of a homestead, as defined in the bill, if the owner has owned
  5 35 the homestead for at least 10 years and is a person who is 70 or
  6  1 older and who has household earned income of less than $12,000
  6  2 per year. If the qualifications established in the bill are
  6  3 met, the assessed value of the homestead upon which property
  6  4 taxes are levied in a fiscal year is the same assessed value as
  6  5 for the previous fiscal year.  The bill specifies that assessed
  6  6 value is that value prior to any rollback being applied.
  6  7    The bill further provides that if the amount of property
  6  8 taxes levied against the adjusted assessment exceeds the amount
  6  9 of property taxes levied against the property in the fiscal
  6 10 year for which taxes were first levied against an adjusted
  6 11 assessment under the bill, the county treasurer is required to
  6 12 subtract such difference from the amount due.
  6 13    The bill provides that a person who makes a false affidavit
  6 14 for the purpose of obtaining an adjustment, knowingly receives
  6 15 the adjustment without being legally entitled to it, or makes
  6 16 claim for the adjustment in more than one county without being
  6 17 legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and
  6 18 is subject to a criminal penalty.
  6 19    The bill applies retroactively to January 1, 2015, for
  6 20 assessment years beginning on or after that date and applies to
  6 21 claims filed on or after January 1, 2016, for the adjustments.
