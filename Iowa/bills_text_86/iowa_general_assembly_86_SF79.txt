  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill modifies the current requirement that all
  4  1 community colleges, regents universities, and accredited
  4  2 postsecondary private institutions develop, implement, and
  4  3 disseminate a written sexual assault policy.  The bill provides
  4  4 that the policy developed, implemented, and disseminated
  4  5 concerns sexual assault including sexual abuse, domestic
  4  6 violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student,
  4  7 both on and off campus.
  4  8    The policy shall include an affirmative consent standard in
  4  9 the determination of whether consent was given by parties to
  4 10 the sexual activity.  The bill defines "affirmative consent" to
  4 11 mean affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage
  4 12 in sexual activity.  Under that standard, each person involved
  4 13 in the sexual activity is responsible for ensuring that the
  4 14 person has the affirmative consent of any other person engaging
  4 15 in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does
  4 16 not mean consent. Silence does not mean consent. Affirmative
  4 17 consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be
  4 18 revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship
  4 19 between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual
  4 20 relations between them, shall not by itself be assumed to be
  4 21 an indicator of consent.
  4 22    The policy must also address the accurate and prompt
  4 23 reporting of sexual assault including sexual abuse, domestic
  4 24 violence, dating violence, and stalking to the duly constituted
  4 25 law enforcement authorities.
