 14 10    2.  The purpose of the programs is to support projects for
 14 11 the installation of infrastructure, including conservation
 14 12 structures, practices, or other measures that reduce
 14 13 contributing nutrient loads, associated sediment, or
 14 14 contaminants from sources to surface waters.  The programs
 14 15 shall be administered in a manner that is consistent with
 14 16 the latest version of the "Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy"

 14 24 program's projects shall be limited to infrastructure designed
 14 25 and installed for use over multiple years, including but not
 14 26 limited to wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers,
 14 27 or land use changes.  The program shall be financed on a
 14 28 cost=share basis.
 14 29    4.  An in=field infrastructure program is created.  The
 14 30 program shall support projects located on agricultural land,
 14 31 which may include demonstration projects, that decrease erosion
 14 32 and precipitation=induced surface runoff, increase water
 14 33 infiltration rates, and increase soil sustainability.  The
 14 34 program's projects shall be limited to infrastructure designed
 14 35 and installed for use over multiple years, including but not
 15  1 limited to structures, terraces, and waterways located on
 15  2 cropland or pastureland, and including but not limited to soil
 15  3 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 15  4 systems.  The program shall be financed on a cost=share basis.
 15  5    5.  Any state moneys used to finance a project under a
 15  6 water quality agriculture infrastructure program shall be
 15  7 administered according to an agreement entered into by the
 15  8 division and the owner of the land where the infrastructure
 15  9 is to be installed.  The agreement shall include standard
 15 10 terms and conditions for the receipt of program moneys and
 15 11 any other terms and conditions the division deems necessary
 15 12 or convenient for the efficient administration of the project
 15 13 or program.  The division may support multiple installations
 15 14 of infrastructure on a single parcel of land.  The division
 15 15 may also combine programs if cost effective.  The division may
 15 16 annually use an amount of not more than four percent of the
 15 17 moneys used to support a program for administrative purposes.
 15 18    6.  By October 1, 2017, and each October 1, thereafter, the
 15 19 division shall submit a report to the governor and the general
 15 20 assembly itemizing expenditures, by hydrologic unit code 8
 15 21 watershed, under the program during the previous fiscal year.
 15 22    7.  Any information obtained by the division identifying
 15 23 a person holding a legal interest in agricultural land or
 15 24 specific agricultural land shall be a confidential record under
 15 25 section 22.7.
 15 26    Sec. 18.   14  6    1.  As part of the water quality initiative established

 14 18 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
 14 19 resources, and Iowa state university of science and technology.
 14 20    3.  An edge=of=field infrastructure program is created.
 14 21 The program shall support projects located on agricultural
 14 22 land, which may include demonstration projects, that capture
 14 23 or filter nutrients entering into a surface water. The
 14 24 program's projects shall be limited to infrastructure designed
 14 25 and installed for use over multiple years, including but not
 14 26 limited to wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers,
 14 27 or land use changes.  The program shall be financed on a
 14 28 cost=share basis.
 14 29    4.  An in=field infrastructure program is created.  The
 14 30 program shall support projects located on agricultural land,
 14 31 which may include demonstration projects, that decrease erosion
 14 32 and precipitation=induced surface runoff, increase water
 14 33 infiltration rates, and increase soil sustainability.  The
 14 34 program's projects shall be limited to infrastructure designed
 14 35 and installed for use over multiple years, including but not
 15  1 limited to structures, terraces, and waterways located on
 15  2 cropland or pastureland, and including but not limited to soil
 15  3 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 15  4 systems.  The program shall be financed on a cost=share basis.
 15  5    5.  Any state moneys used to finance a project under a
 15  6 water quality agriculture infrastructure program shall be
 15  7 administered according to an agreement entered into by the
 15  8 division and the owner of the land where the infrastructure
 15  9 is to be installed.  The agreement shall include standard
 15 10 terms and conditions for the receipt of program moneys and
 15 11 any other terms and conditions the division deems necessary
 15 12 or convenient for the efficient administration of the project
 15 13 or program.  The division may support multiple installations
 15 14 of infrastructure on a single parcel of land.  The division
 15 15 may also combine programs if cost effective.  The division may
 15 16 annually use an amount of not more than four percent of the
 15 17 moneys used to support a program for administrative purposes.
 15 18    6.  By October 1, 2017, and each October 1, thereafter, the
 15 19 division shall submit a report to the governor and the general
 15 20 assembly itemizing expenditures, by hydrologic unit code 8
 15 21 watershed, under the program during the previous fiscal year.
 15 22    7.  Any information obtained by the division identifying
 15 23 a person holding a legal interest in agricultural land or
 15 24 specific agricultural land shall be a confidential record under
 15 25 section 22.7.
 15 26    Sec. 18.   14 10    2.  The purpose of the programs is to support projects for
 14 11 the installation of infrastructure, including conservation
 14 12 structures, practices, or other measures that reduce
 14 13 contributing nutrient loads, associated sediment, or
 14 14 contaminants from sources to surface waters.  The programs
 14 15 shall be administered in a manner that is consistent with
 14 16 the latest version of the "Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy"
