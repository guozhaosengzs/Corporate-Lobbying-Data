  1  1    Section 1.  Section 441.21, subsection 4, Code 2015, is
  1  2 amended to read as follows:
  1  3    4.  For valuations established as of January 1, 1979,
  1  4 the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and
  1  5 residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient
  1  6 of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section. The
  1  7 dividend for each class of property shall be the dividend
  1  8 as determined for each class of property for valuations
  1  9 established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product
  1 10 obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that
  1 11 year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual
  1 12 value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of
  1 13 existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the
  1 14 abstracts of assessment for 1978, plus six percent of the
  1 15 amount so determined. However, if the difference between the
  1 16 dividend so determined for either class of property and the
  1 17 dividend for that class of property for valuations established
  1 18 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by
  1 19 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the
  1 20 amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding
  1 21 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
  1 22 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
  1 23 for 1978, is less than six percent, the 1979 dividend for the
  1 24 other class of property shall be the dividend as determined for
  1 25 that class of property for valuations established as of January
  1 26 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying
  1 27 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of
  1 28 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those
  1 29 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as
  1 30 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for
  1 31 1978, plus a percentage of the amount so determined which is
  1 32 equal to the percentage by which the dividend as determined
  1 33 for the other class of property for valuations established
  1 34 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by
  1 35 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the
  2  1 amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding
  2  2 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
  2  3 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
  2  4 for 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for
  2  5 the other class of property. The divisor for each class of
  2  6 property shall be the total actual value of all such property
  2  7 in the state in the preceding year, as reported by the
  2  8 assessors on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978,
  2  9 plus the amount of value added to said total actual value by
  2 10 the revaluation of existing properties in 1979 as equalized
  2 11 by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49. The
  2 12 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of
  2 13 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining
  2 14 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 1,
  2 15 1980, and each assessment year thereafter beginning before
  2 16 January 1, 2013, the percentage of actual value as equalized
  2 17 by the director of revenue as provided in section 441.49 at
  2 18 which agricultural and residential property shall be assessed
  2 19 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods provided
  2 20 in this subsection, including the limitation of increases in
  2 21 agricultural and residential assessed values to the percentage
  2 22 increase of the other class of property if the other class
  2 23 increases less than the allowable limit adjusted to include
  2 24 the applicable and current values as equalized by the director
  2 25 of revenue, except that any references to six percent in this
  2 26 subsection shall be four percent. For valuations established

  1  4 the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and
  1  5 residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient
  1  6 of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section. The
  1  7 dividend for each class of property shall be the dividend
  1  8 as determined for each class of property for valuations
  1  9 established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product
  1 10 obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that
  1 11 year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual
  1 12 value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of
  1 13 existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the
  1 14 abstracts of assessment for 1978, plus six percent of the

  1 16 dividend so determined for either class of property and the

  1 21 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
  1 22 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment

  1 24 other class of property shall be the dividend as determined for
  1 25 that class of property for valuations established as of January
  1 26 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying
  1 27 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of
  1 28 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those
  1 29 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as
  1 30 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for

  1 32 equal to the percentage by which the dividend as determined
  1 33 for the other class of property for valuations established
  1 34 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by
  1 35 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the

  2  2 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
  2  3 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
  2  4 for 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for
  2  5 the other class of property. The divisor for each class of
  2  6 property shall be the total actual value of all such property
  2  7 in the state in the preceding year, as reported by the
  2  8 assessors on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978,
  2  9 plus the amount of value added to said total actual value by
  2 10 the revaluation of existing properties in 1979 as equalized
  2 11 by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49. The
  2 12 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of
  2 13 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining
  2 14 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 1,
  2 15 1980, and each assessment year thereafter beginning before
  2 16 January 1, 2013, the percentage of actual value as equalized
  2 17 by the director of revenue as provided in section 441.49 at
  2 18 which agricultural and residential property shall be assessed
  2 19 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods provided

  3 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 19    Current Code section 441.21 imposes limitations on the
  3 20 annual increase in statewide actual value of residential
  3 21 property and agricultural property due to revaluation.
  3 22 Accordingly, the assessed value subject to taxation is a
  3 23 percentage of the assessed value as a result of those statewide
  3 24 limitations on annual growth.
  3 25    As part of the assessment limitation calculation for
  3 26 residential property and agricultural property, Code section
  3 27 441.21 provides that if the increase due to revaluation for
  3 28 either class of property is less than 3 percent, the annual
  3 29 increase in each class of property is limited to the smaller
  3 30 of the two increases in either class of property.  This bill
  3 31 removes that provision for the calculation of assessment
  3 32 limitations for assessment years beginning on or after January
  3 33 1, 2016.

  3 22 Accordingly, the assessed value subject to taxation is a
  3 23 percentage of the assessed value as a result of those statewide

  3 25    As part of the assessment limitation calculation for
  3 26 residential property and agricultural property, Code section
  3 27 441.21 provides that if the increase due to revaluation for
  3 28 either class of property is less than 3 percent, the annual
  3 29 increase in each class of property is limited to the smaller
  3 30 of the two increases in either class of property.  This bill

  3 32 limitations for assessment years beginning on or after January
  3 33 1, 2016.
