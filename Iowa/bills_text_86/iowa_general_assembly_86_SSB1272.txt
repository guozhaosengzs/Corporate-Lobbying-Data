S.F.
_____


the
amount
credited
to
the
fund
will
be
equal
to
the
amount
1


generated
by
an
increase
in
the
state
sales
tax
rate
occurring
2


after
the
effective
date
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
but
3


shall
not
exceed
the
amount
that
a
state
sales
tax
rate
of
4


0.375
percent
would
generate.
The
state
sales
tax
rate
has
not
5


been

6.375
percent
the

tax
rate,

section

from
1/6th
(approximately
16.66
percent)
of
the
revenues
13


to
15.6863
percent
of

to
ensure
that
SAVE

approximately
the
same
proportion
of
the
total
use
tax
revenue
15


as
it
did
prior
to
the
use
tax
rate
increase
provided
in
