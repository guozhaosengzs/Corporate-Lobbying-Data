  1 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 22    Code section 423.2 imposes a state sales tax of 6 percent
  1 23 upon the sales price of all sales of tangible personal
  1 24 property, consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other
  1 25 items designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
  1 26 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  1 27 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  1 28 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  1 29 of amounts required by statute, one=sixth of the remaining
  1 30 state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred
  1 31 to the secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund
  1 32 created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE fund are
  1 33 allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to be
  1 34 used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  1 35 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  2  1 and use tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January
  2  2 1, 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  2  3 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  2  4    This bill repeals Code section 423F.6, which currently
  2  5 provides for the repeal of Code chapter 423F on December 31,
  2  6 2029.  The bill also strikes corresponding repeal provisions
  2  7 relating to the allocation of sales tax revenue and provisions
  2  8 that reduce the state sales and use tax rate from 6 percent to 5
  2  9 percent beginning January 1, 2030.
