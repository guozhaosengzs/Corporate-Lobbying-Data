  6 14                           EXPLANATION
  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases
  8  5 the cumulative value of solar energy system tax credits which
  8  6 may be claimed annually from $4 million to $6 million. These
  8  7 changes are correspondingly made to the corporate and franchise
  8  8 solar energy system tax credit provisions contained in Code
  8  9 sections 422.33 and 422.60.  These provisions are retroactively
  8 10 applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or
  8 11 after that date.
  8 12    With regard to renewable energy tax credit provisions
  8 13 contained in Code chapter 476C, the bill extends placement in
  8 14 service requirements for eligible renewable energy facilities
  8 15 that have applied for eligibility approval on or after
  8 16 January 1, 2008, but which are not operational on the bill's
  8 17 effective date, from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.
  8 18 The bill correspondingly extends the period during which
  8 19 renewable energy tax credit certificates may be issued for such
  8 20 facilities by two years, from December 31, 2026, to December
  8 21 31, 2028.
  8 22    Additionally, the bill modifies references to the maximum
  8 23 amount of British thermal units of heat for a commercial
  8 24 purpose which may be included in energy production capacity
  8 25 equivalent qualifying for a renewable energy tax credit. Such
  8 26 references shall apply on an annual basis. These provisions
  8 27 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2014, for tax years
  8 28 beginning on or after that date.
  8 29    Finally, the bill reserves one megawatt of nameplate
  8 30 generating capacity for wind energy conversion facilities
  8 31 installed within a small wind innovation zone established
  8 32 pursuant to Code section 476.48.  This reserved capacity
  8 33 commences January 1, 2016.
  8 34    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal

  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,

  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,

  6 14                           EXPLANATION
  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases
  8  5 the cumulative value of solar energy system tax credits which
  8  6 may be claimed annually from $4 million to $6 million. These
  8  7 changes are correspondingly made to the corporate and franchise
  8  8 solar energy system tax credit provisions contained in Code
  8  9 sections 422.33 and 422.60.  These provisions are retroactively
  8 10 applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or
  8 11 after that date.
  8 12    With regard to renewable energy tax credit provisions
  8 13 contained in Code chapter 476C, the bill extends placement in
  8 14 service requirements for eligible renewable energy facilities
  8 15 that have applied for eligibility approval on or after
  8 16 January 1, 2008, but which are not operational on the bill's
  8 17 effective date, from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.
  8 18 The bill correspondingly extends the period during which
  8 19 renewable energy tax credit certificates may be issued for such
  8 20 facilities by two years, from December 31, 2026, to December
  8 21 31, 2028.
  8 22    Additionally, the bill modifies references to the maximum
  8 23 amount of British thermal units of heat for a commercial
  8 24 purpose which may be included in energy production capacity
  8 25 equivalent qualifying for a renewable energy tax credit. Such
  8 26 references shall apply on an annual basis. These provisions
  8 27 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2014, for tax years
  8 28 beginning on or after that date.
  8 29    Finally, the bill reserves one megawatt of nameplate
  8 30 generating capacity for wind energy conversion facilities
  8 31 installed within a small wind innovation zone established
  8 32 pursuant to Code section 476.48.  This reserved capacity
  8 33 commences January 1, 2016.

  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases

  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the

  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases
  8  5 the cumulative value of solar energy system tax credits which
  8  6 may be claimed annually from $4 million to $6 million. These
  8  7 changes are correspondingly made to the corporate and franchise
  8  8 solar energy system tax credit provisions contained in Code
  8  9 sections 422.33 and 422.60.  These provisions are retroactively
  8 10 applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or
  8 11 after that date.
  8 12    With regard to renewable energy tax credit provisions
  8 13 contained in Code chapter 476C, the bill extends placement in
  8 14 service requirements for eligible renewable energy facilities
  8 15 that have applied for eligibility approval on or after
  8 16 January 1, 2008, but which are not operational on the bill's
  8 17 effective date, from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.
  8 18 The bill correspondingly extends the period during which
  8 19 renewable energy tax credit certificates may be issued for such
  8 20 facilities by two years, from December 31, 2026, to December
  8 21 31, 2028.
  8 22    Additionally, the bill modifies references to the maximum
  8 23 amount of British thermal units of heat for a commercial
  8 24 purpose which may be included in energy production capacity
  8 25 equivalent qualifying for a renewable energy tax credit. Such
  8 26 references shall apply on an annual basis. These provisions
  8 27 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2014, for tax years
  8 28 beginning on or after that date.
  8 29    Finally, the bill reserves one megawatt of nameplate
  8 30 generating capacity for wind energy conversion facilities
  8 31 installed within a small wind innovation zone established
  8 32 pursuant to Code section 476.48.  This reserved capacity
  8 33 commences January 1, 2016.

  6 14                           EXPLANATION
  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases
  8  5 the cumulative value of solar energy system tax credits which
  8  6 may be claimed annually from $4 million to $6 million. These
  8  7 changes are correspondingly made to the corporate and franchise
  8  8 solar energy system tax credit provisions contained in Code
  8  9 sections 422.33 and 422.60.  These provisions are retroactively
  8 10 applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or
  8 11 after that date.
  8 12    With regard to renewable energy tax credit provisions
  8 13 contained in Code chapter 476C, the bill extends placement in
  8 14 service requirements for eligible renewable energy facilities
  8 15 that have applied for eligibility approval on or after
  8 16 January 1, 2008, but which are not operational on the bill's
  8 17 effective date, from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.
  8 18 The bill correspondingly extends the period during which
  8 19 renewable energy tax credit certificates may be issued for such
  8 20 facilities by two years, from December 31, 2026, to December
  8 21 31, 2028.
  8 22    Additionally, the bill modifies references to the maximum
  8 23 amount of British thermal units of heat for a commercial
  8 24 purpose which may be included in energy production capacity
  8 25 equivalent qualifying for a renewable energy tax credit. Such
  8 26 references shall apply on an annual basis. These provisions
  8 27 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2014, for tax years
  8 28 beginning on or after that date.
  8 29    Finally, the bill reserves one megawatt of nameplate
  8 30 generating capacity for wind energy conversion facilities
  8 31 installed within a small wind innovation zone established

  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for

  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.

  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for

  6 17    This bill modifies existing renewable energy tax credit
  6 18 provisions and enacts new renewable energy tax credit
  6 19 provisions.
  6 20    The bill establishes a wind energy system tax credit against
  6 21 the individual and corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
  6 22 The tax credit is equal to the sum of 50 percent of the federal
  6 23 residential energy efficient property credit related to small
  6 24 wind energy provided in section 25D(a)(4) of the Internal
  6 25 Revenue Code, not to exceed $5,000, and 50 percent of the
  6 26 federal energy credit related to small wind energy provided in
  6 27 section 48(a)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code, not
  6 28 to exceed $20,000.
  6 29    The bill provides that any credit in excess of the tax
  6 30 liability is not refundable but the excess for the tax year may
  6 31 be credited to the tax liability for the following 10 years or
  6 32 until depleted, whichever is earlier.
  6 33    The bill provides that a taxpayer who is eligible to claim
  6 34 the wind energy system tax credit shall not be eligible to
  6 35 claim a wind energy production tax credit under Code chapter
  7  1 476B or a renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C.
  7  2  A taxpayer may claim more than one wind energy system tax
  7  3 credit but may claim only one credit per separate and distinct
  7  4 small wind energy system installation. The department shall
  7  5 establish criteria by rule for determining what constitutes a
  7  6 separate and distinct installation.
  7  7    The bill requires that a taxpayer must submit an application
  7  8 to the department for each separate and distinct wind energy
  7  9 installation for approval. The application must be filed by
  7 10 May 1 following the year of the installation of the small wind
  7 11 energy system.
  7 12    The bill states that each tax year the total amount of wind
  7 13 energy system tax credit claims that shall be paid shall not
  7 14 exceed the amount appropriated by the general assembly for that
  7 15 purpose.  If the total dollar amount of the  claims exceeds
  7 16 that amount, each claim shall be paid an amount equal to the
  7 17 amount appropriated divided by the total number of claims, not
  7 18 to exceed the amount of the taxpayer's claim.  If an amount
  7 19 of tax credits available for a tax year goes unclaimed, the
  7 20 amount of the unclaimed tax credits shall be made available for
  7 21 the following tax year in which an appropriation is made in
  7 22 addition to, and cumulated with, the amount appropriated for
  7 23 that following tax year.
  7 24    The bill requires the department, on or before January 1,
  7 25 annually, if tax credits have been claimed during the preceding
  7 26 tax year, to submit a written report to the governor and the
  7 27 general assembly regarding the number and value of tax credits
  7 28 claimed and any other information the department may deem
  7 29 relevant and appropriate.
  7 30    The provisions enacting the wind energy system tax credit
  7 31 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years
  7 32 beginning on or after that date.
  7 33    The bill modifies provisions applicable to the solar energy
  7 34 system tax credit.  The bill provides that for solar energy
  7 35 system installations occurring on or after January 1, 2016,
  8  1 the percentages of the federal residential energy efficiency
  8  2 property credit related to solar energy and the federal energy
  8  3 credit related to solar energy which may be claimed shall be
  8  4 reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent.  The bill increases
  8  5 the cumulative value of solar energy system tax credits which
  8  6 may be claimed annually from $4 million to $6 million. These
  8  7 changes are correspondingly made to the corporate and franchise
  8  8 solar energy system tax credit provisions contained in Code
  8  9 sections 422.33 and 422.60.  These provisions are retroactively
  8 10 applicable to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on or
  8 11 after that date.
  8 12    With regard to renewable energy tax credit provisions
  8 13 contained in Code chapter 476C, the bill extends placement in
  8 14 service requirements for eligible renewable energy facilities
  8 15 that have applied for eligibility approval on or after
  8 16 January 1, 2008, but which are not operational on the bill's
  8 17 effective date, from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019.
  8 18 The bill correspondingly extends the period during which
  8 19 renewable energy tax credit certificates may be issued for such
  8 20 facilities by two years, from December 31, 2026, to December
  8 21 31, 2028.
  8 22    Additionally, the bill modifies references to the maximum
  8 23 amount of British thermal units of heat for a commercial
  8 24 purpose which may be included in energy production capacity
  8 25 equivalent qualifying for a renewable energy tax credit. Such
  8 26 references shall apply on an annual basis. These provisions
  8 27 are retroactively applicable to January 1, 2014, for tax years
  8 28 beginning on or after that date.
  8 29    Finally, the bill reserves one megawatt of nameplate
  8 30 generating capacity for wind energy conversion facilities
  8 31 installed within a small wind innovation zone established
  8 32 pursuant to Code section 476.48.  This reserved capacity
