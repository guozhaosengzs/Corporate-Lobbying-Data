 11 24    1.  In accordance with other applicable laws, when entering
 11 25 into a lease with an applicant for the applicant's use of
 11 26 public lands, an authority shall offer the market rate value
 11 27 for use of that land. The term of the lease shall be for at
 11 28 least twenty years.
 11 29    2.  a.  If the authority and the applicant cannot agree on
 11 30 the market rate for lease of the public land and cannot agree
 11 31 on the process to derive the market rate, a three=person panel
 11 32 of appraisers shall determine the market rate.  Each party will
 11 33 appoint one appraiser and the two appointed appraisers shall
 11 34 select a third appraiser.  Each appraiser shall independently
 11 35 appraise the appropriate market rate for lease of the land.
 12  1 The market rate shall be set at the median value between
 12  2 the highest and lowest market rates determined by the three
 12  3 independent appraisers.  However, if the median between the
 12  4 appraisals of the appraisers appointed by each party is greater
 12  5 than or less than ten percent of the appraisal of the appraiser
 12  6 selected by the two appraisers, then the appraisal of the
 12  7 appraiser selected by the two appraisers shall determine the
 12  8 rate for the lease.
 12  9    b.  The authority and applicant shall conclude the appraisal
 12 10 process within one hundred fifty calendar days from the date
 12 11 the applicant first offered a proposed lease rate to the
 12 12 authority.
 12 13    c.  If using the three=person panel, each party shall bear
 12 14 the cost of its own appointed appraiser and equally share the
 12 15 cost of the third appraiser.
 12 16                           EXPLANATION
 12 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 19    This bill relates to the deployment of and applications for
 12 20 wireless communications facilities and infrastructure.
 12 21    The bill provides a number of definitions regarding wireless
 12 22 facilities and infrastructure.  "Authority" is defined to mean
 12 23 a state, county, or municipal governing body, board, agency,
 12 24 office, or commission authorized by law to make legislative,
 12 25 quasi=judicial, or administrative decisions relative to an
 12 26 application.  "Application" is defined as a request submitted
 12 27 by an applicant to an authority to construct a new tower, for
 12 28 the initial placement of transmission equipment on a wireless
 12 29 support structure, for the modification of an existing tower
 12 30 or existing base station that constitutes a substantial
 12 31 change to an existing tower or existing base station, or any
 12 32 other request to construct or place transmission equipment
 12 33 that does not meet the definition of an eligible facilities
 12 34 request as it is not a substantial change.  "Tower" is a
 12 35 structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting
 13  1 an authorized or federal communications commission licensed
 13  2 antenna and the associated facilities.  "Wireless support
 13  3 structure" is defined as a structure that exists at the time
 13  4 an application is submitted and is capable of supporting the
 13  5 attachment or installation of transmission equipment, but does
 13  6 not include a tower or existing base station.  "Transmission
 13  7 equipment" means equipment that facilitates transmission for an
 13  8 authorized federal communications commission licensed wireless
 13  9 communications service.
 13 10    The bill provides a series of uniform rules or limitations
 13 11 applicable to all applications.  The rules and limitations
 13 12 include prohibiting requiring certain information, as specified
 13 13 in the bill, from or about an applicant.
 13 14    The bill provides timeframes within which an authority must
 13 15 act upon an application to construct a new tower, for the
 13 16 initial placement or installation of transmission equipment on
 13 17 wireless support structures, for modification of an existing
 13 18 tower or base station that constitutes a substantial change,
 13 19 or for a request for construction or placement of transmission
 13 20 equipment that does not constitute an eligible facilities
 13 21 request. The authority may request that the applicant cure
 13 22 deficiencies in the application, during which time the
 13 23 timeframe for review is tolled.
 13 24    When entering into a lease with an applicant for the
 13 25 applicant's use of public land, the bill requires an authority
 13 26 to offer the market rate value for use of that land and a lease
 13 27 term of at least 20 years.  The bill provides a process for
 13 28 determination of the market rate value for purposes of the
 13 29 lease if the authority and the applicant disagree on the rate.
       LSB 2400HV (1) 86
       ad/sc

 11 26 public lands, an authority shall offer the market rate value
 11 27 for use of that land. The term of the lease shall be for at
 11 28 least twenty years.
 11 29    2.  a.  If the authority and the applicant cannot agree on
 11 30 the market rate for lease of the public land and cannot agree
 11 31 on the process to derive the market rate, a three=person panel
 11 32 of appraisers shall determine the market rate.  Each party will
