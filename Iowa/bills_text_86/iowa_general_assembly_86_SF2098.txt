  1 15 child.
  1 16    (c)  "Undue hardship" means an action requiring significant
  1 17 difficulty or expense.
  1 18    (2)  It shall be an unfair or discriminatory practice for an
  1 19 employer to do any of the following:
  1 20    (a)  Deny a reasonable accommodation in the terms,
  1 21 conditions, or privileges of employment to a job applicant or
  1 22 employee based on the employee's or applicant's pregnancy,

  1 26 impose an undue hardship on the employer's program, enterprise,
  1 27 or business.
  1 28    (b)  Take adverse action against an employee who requests
  1 29 or uses a reasonable accommodation pursuant to this paragraph.
  1 30 Such adverse action includes but is not limited to failing to
  1 31 reinstate the employee to the employee's original job or to
  1 32 an equivalent position with equivalent pay and accumulated
  1 33 seniority, retirement, fringe benefits, and other applicable
  1 34 service credits when the employee's need for a reasonable
  1 35 accommodation ceases.
  2  1    (c)  Deny employment opportunities to a job applicant or
  2  2 employee if such denial is based on the need of the employer
  2  3 to make a reasonable accommodation to the job applicant or
  2  4 employee pursuant to this paragraph.

  2  6 pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition to accept
  2  7 an accommodation that the applicant or employee declines to
  2  8 accept.
  2  9    (e)  Require an employee to take employment leave if another

  2 31 of employees that requires such accommodation shall create a
  2 32 rebuttable presumption that the accommodation does not impose
  2 33 an undue hardship on the employer.
  2 34    (5)  An employer shall not be required under this paragraph
  2 35 to create additional jobs or provide additional work hours
  3  1 that the employer would not otherwise have created or
  3  2 provided, unless the employer does so or would do so to
  3  3 accommodate another class of employees that requires such
  3  4 accommodation. An employer shall not be required under this
  3  5 paragraph to discharge any employee, transfer any employee
  3  6 with more seniority than an employee requesting a reasonable
  3  7 accommodation, or promote any employee who is not qualified
  3  8 to perform a job, unless the employer does so or would do so
  3  9 to accommodate another class of employees that requires such
  3 10 accommodation.
  3 11    (6)  An employer shall post written notice in a form
  3 12 prescribed by the commission of the right to be free from

  3 24    (7)  The commission shall develop courses of instruction
  3 25 and conduct ongoing public education efforts as necessary to
  3 26 inform employers, employees, employment agencies, and job
  3 27 applicants regarding their rights and responsibilities under
  3 28 this paragraph.
  3 29    (8)  This paragraph shall not be construed to narrow
  3 30 or restrict any other provision of law relating to sex
  3 31 discrimination or pregnancy, or to diminish any right or
  3 32 responsibility thereunder.
  3 33                           EXPLANATION
  3 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  4  7 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4  8 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4  9 medical condition upon request, unless the employer can
  4 10 demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an
  4 11 undue hardship on the employer.
  4 12    The bill prohibits an employer from taking adverse action
  4 13 against an employee who requests or uses such a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation.
  4 15    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment
  4 16 opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is
  4 17 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 18 accommodation.
  4 19    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 20 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the
  4 22 applicant or employee declines to accept.
  4 23    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an employee

  5 13 of proving undue hardship under the bill. The bill provides
  5 14 a nonexclusive list of factors to be considered by the civil

  5 16 specifies that an employer who provides or would be required to
  5 17 provide a similar accommodation to another class of employees
  5 18 that requires such accommodation shall create a rebuttable
  5 19 presumption that the accommodation does not impose an undue
  5 20 hardship on the employer.
  5 21    The bill does not require an employer to create additional
  5 22 jobs or provide additional work hours that the employer
  5 23 would not otherwise have created or provided, unless the
  5 24 employer does so or would do so to accommodate another class
  5 25 of employees that requires such accommodation. The bill does
  5 26 not require an employer to discharge any employee, transfer
  5 27 any employee with more seniority than an employee requesting
  5 28 a reasonable accommodation, or promote any employee who is

  5 33 right to be free from discrimination in relation to pregnancy,

  6  7 necessary to inform employers, employees, employment agencies,
  6  8 and job applicants regarding their rights and responsibilities
  6  9 under the bill.
  6 10    The bill shall not be construed to narrow or restrict
  6 11 any other provision of law relating to sex discrimination
  6 12 or pregnancy, or to diminish any right or responsibility

  4  2 employment practices under Code chapter 216, "Iowa Civil Rights
  4  3 Act of 1965", concerning pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4  4 medical conditions.
  4  5    The bill prohibits an employer from denying a reasonable
  4  6 accommodation in the terms, conditions, or privileges of
  4  7 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4  8 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4  9 medical condition upon request, unless the employer can
  4 10 demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an
  4 11 undue hardship on the employer.
  4 12    The bill prohibits an employer from taking adverse action
  4 13 against an employee who requests or uses such a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation.
  4 15    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment
  4 16 opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is
  4 17 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 18 accommodation.
  4 19    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 20 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the
  4 22 applicant or employee declines to accept.
  4 23    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an employee

  4 26 the employer.
  4 27    The bill prohibits an employer from making an inquiry
  4 28 prior to employment regarding a job applicant's pregnancy,

  4 14 accommodation.

  1 35 accommodation ceases.
  2  1    (c)  Deny employment opportunities to a job applicant or

  3 26 inform employers, employees, employment agencies, and job
  3 27 applicants regarding their rights and responsibilities under

  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the

  4  7 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4  8 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related

  4 10 demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an
  4 11 undue hardship on the employer.

  4 13 against an employee who requests or uses such a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation.
  4 15    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment

  4 17 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 18 accommodation.
  4 19    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 20 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the

  4  4 medical conditions.
  4  5    The bill prohibits an employer from denying a reasonable
  4  6 accommodation in the terms, conditions, or privileges of
  4  7 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4  8 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related

  4 13 against an employee who requests or uses such a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation.
  4 15    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment

  4 17 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 18 accommodation.
  4 19    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 20 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the

  4 23    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an employee

  4  2 employment practices under Code chapter 216, "Iowa Civil Rights
  4  3 Act of 1965", concerning pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4  4 medical conditions.
  4  5    The bill prohibits an employer from denying a reasonable
  4  6 accommodation in the terms, conditions, or privileges of
  4  7 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4  8 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4  9 medical condition upon request, unless the employer can
  4 10 demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an
  4 11 undue hardship on the employer.
  4 12    The bill prohibits an employer from taking adverse action
  4 13 against an employee who requests or uses such a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation.
  4 15    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment
  4 16 opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is
  4 17 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 18 accommodation.
  4 19    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 20 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 21 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the
  4 22 applicant or employee declines to accept.
  4 23    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an employee

  4 28 prior to employment regarding a job applicant's pregnancy,

  5 25 of employees that requires such accommodation. The bill does
  5 26 not require an employer to discharge any employee, transfer
