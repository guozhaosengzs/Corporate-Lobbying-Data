The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
relates
to
the
electronic
delivery
and
posting
of
3


insurance
notices
and
documents.
The
bill
provides
that
the
4


electronic
delivery
of
such
notices
and
documents
by
insurers
5


must
meet
the
requirements
of
Code
section
505B.1
as
well
as
6


the
requirements
of
Code
chapter
554D,
which
relates
generally
7


to
electronic
transactions.
8


The
bill
provides
that
an
insurance
notice
or
document
may
9


be
delivered
by
electronic
means
if,
before
giving
consent,
10


the
party
who
is
to
receive
the
notice
(an
applicant,
insured,
11


policyholder,
or
annuity
contract
holder)
is
provided
with
a
12


statement
explaining
the
right
to
withdraw
consent
to
such
13


delivery
at
any
time,
the
types
of
notices
and
documents
to
14


which
consent
applies,
the
right
to
have
the
notices
and
15


documents
in
paper
form,
and
the
procedures
to
withdraw
consent
16


or
update
the
party’s
electronic
mail
address.
The
insurer
17


must
also
notify
the
party
annually
of
the
party’s
electronic
18


address
that
is
on
file
for
the
party
and
take
reasonable
19


measures
to
ensure
that
electronic

If
there
is

23


the
insurer
must
inform
the
party
of

the
right
24


of
the
party
to
withdraw
consent.
Failure
of
an
insurer
to
25


comply
with
these
requirements
may
be
treated
as
a
withdrawal
26


of
consent.
27


If
the

electronically
deliver
additional
28


notices
or
documents
to
a
party
who

consented
to
such
29


delivery,

additional

will
be
electronically
31


delivered,

reiterate
what
consent
means
and
the
party’s
32


right
to
withdraw
such
consent.
33


An
insurer
is
required
to
deliver
a
notice
or
document
by
any
34


other
delivery
method
permitted
by
law
