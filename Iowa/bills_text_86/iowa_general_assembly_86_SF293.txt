  1  4 geographical area designated as a mental health care health
  1  5 professional shortage area by the department of public health.
  1  6    2.  A mental health professional loan forgiveness program
  1  7 is established to be administered by the commission. A mental
  1  8 health professional, as defined in section 228.1, is eligible
  1  9 for the program if the mental health professional is a resident
  1 10 of Iowa who is practicing in an underserved area.
  1 11    3.  Each applicant for loan forgiveness under this section
  1 12 shall, in accordance with the rules of the commission, do the

  1 14    a.  Complete and file an application for mental health
  1 15 professional loan forgiveness. The applicant shall be

  1 18    b.  Complete and return on a form approved by the commission
  1 19 an affidavit of practice verifying that the applicant is a
  1 20 mental health professional practicing in an underserved area.
  1 21    3A.  Notwithstanding subsection 3, paragraph "b", an
  1 22 individual who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree from

  1 24 that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental health
  1 25 professional, as defined in section 228.1, upon completion
  1 26 of a residency program, and who is accepted in an Iowa=based
  1 27 residency program, is eligible to enter into a program
  1 28 agreement with the commission.  The program agreement shall
  1 29 provide that in order to receive loan forgiveness under this
  1 30 section, the individual shall agree to engage in full=time

  2  9 health professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  2 10 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  2 11 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  2 12 whichever amount is less.

  2 14 payments under this section is required to file an application
  2 15 annually and submit information as required by the commission
  2 16 on the basis of which the applicant's continued eligibility for
  2 17 the loan forgiveness program will be evaluated and determined.
  2 18    5.  A mental health professional loan forgiveness fund is
  2 19 created as a separate fund in the state treasury under the
  2 20 control of the commission for deposit of moneys appropriated
  2 21 to or received by the commission for use under the program.
  2 22 Moneys credited to the fund are appropriated to the commission
  2 23 for purposes of the mental health professional loan forgiveness
  2 24 program. Notwithstanding section 8.33, moneys deposited in the
  2 25 fund shall not revert to any fund of the state at the end of

  3  9    This bill establishes a mental health professional loan

  3 11 student aid commission.  Under the program, mental health
  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and
  3 15 "underserved area" for purposes of the program.  A mental
  3 16 health professional either holds at least a master's degree in
  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has

  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to

  3 29 professional, but who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree
  3 30 from an accredited postsecondary institution in a degree
  3 31 program that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental
  3 32 health professional upon completion of a residency program,
  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program

  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of
  4 20 any fiscal year, and interest or earnings on moneys deposited
  4 21 in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  4 22    The commission shall submit a report to the general assembly
  4 23 by January 1, annually, detailing the number of mental health

  3  9    This bill establishes a mental health professional loan

  3 11 student aid commission.  Under the program, mental health
  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and
  3 15 "underserved area" for purposes of the program.  A mental
  3 16 health professional either holds at least a master's degree in
  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has
  3 18 at least two years of post=degree clinical experience or is a

  3 24 geographical area designated as a mental health professional
  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to
  3 28 the commission.  A person who is not yet a mental health
  3 29 professional, but who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree
  3 30 from an accredited postsecondary institution in a degree
  3 31 program that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental

  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program
  3 35 agreement with the commission.  Under the program agreement,
  4  1 the individual agrees to engage in full=time practice as a
  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of
  4 20 any fiscal year, and interest or earnings on moneys deposited
  4 21 in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  4 22    The commission shall submit a report to the general assembly
  4 23 by January 1, annually, detailing the number of mental health

  3  6                           EXPLANATION
  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill establishes a mental health professional loan
  3 10 forgiveness program under the administration of the college
  3 11 student aid commission.  Under the program, mental health
  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and
  3 15 "underserved area" for purposes of the program.  A mental
  3 16 health professional either holds at least a master's degree in
  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has
  3 18 at least two years of post=degree clinical experience or is a
  3 19 licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, an advanced registered
  3 20 nurse practitioner who holds a national certification in
  3 21 psychiatric mental health care registered by the board
  3 22 of nursing, or a physician assistant practicing under the
  3 23 supervision of a psychiatrist.  An underserved area is a
  3 24 geographical area designated as a mental health professional
  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to
  3 28 the commission.  A person who is not yet a mental health
  3 29 professional, but who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree
  3 30 from an accredited postsecondary institution in a degree
  3 31 program that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental
  3 32 health professional upon completion of a residency program,
  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program
  3 35 agreement with the commission.  Under the program agreement,
  4  1 the individual agrees to engage in full=time practice as a
  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of
  4 20 any fiscal year, and interest or earnings on moneys deposited
  4 21 in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  4 22    The commission shall submit a report to the general assembly
  4 23 by January 1, annually, detailing the number of mental health
  4 24 professionals who received loan forgiveness payments and the
  4 25 amount paid to each recipient, the underserved areas in which
  4 26 they practice or practiced, and other information identified by
  4 27 the commission as indicators of outcomes from the program.

  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and

  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has
  3 18 at least two years of post=degree clinical experience or is a

  3 24 geographical area designated as a mental health professional
  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to

  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program
  3 35 agreement with the commission.  Under the program agreement,
  4  1 the individual agrees to engage in full=time practice as a
  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of

  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to

  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and

  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first

  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the

  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill establishes a mental health professional loan
  3 10 forgiveness program under the administration of the college
  3 11 student aid commission.  Under the program, mental health
  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and
  3 15 "underserved area" for purposes of the program.  A mental
  3 16 health professional either holds at least a master's degree in
  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has
  3 18 at least two years of post=degree clinical experience or is a
  3 19 licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, an advanced registered
  3 20 nurse practitioner who holds a national certification in
  3 21 psychiatric mental health care registered by the board
  3 22 of nursing, or a physician assistant practicing under the
  3 23 supervision of a psychiatrist.  An underserved area is a
  3 24 geographical area designated as a mental health professional
  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to
  3 28 the commission.  A person who is not yet a mental health
  3 29 professional, but who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree
  3 30 from an accredited postsecondary institution in a degree
  3 31 program that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental
  3 32 health professional upon completion of a residency program,
  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program
  3 35 agreement with the commission.  Under the program agreement,
  4  1 the individual agrees to engage in full=time practice as a
  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of
  4 20 any fiscal year, and interest or earnings on moneys deposited
  4 21 in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  4 22    The commission shall submit a report to the general assembly
  4 23 by January 1, annually, detailing the number of mental health
  4 24 professionals who received loan forgiveness payments and the
  4 25 amount paid to each recipient, the underserved areas in which

  3  6                           EXPLANATION
  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill establishes a mental health professional loan
  3 10 forgiveness program under the administration of the college
  3 11 student aid commission.  Under the program, mental health
  3 12 professionals who practice in underserved areas are eligible
  3 13 for loan forgiveness payments for up to five years.
  3 14    The bill defines "mental health professional" and
  3 15 "underserved area" for purposes of the program.  A mental
  3 16 health professional either holds at least a master's degree in
  3 17 a mental health field, holds a current Iowa license, and has
  3 18 at least two years of post=degree clinical experience or is a
  3 19 licensed psychiatrist or psychologist, an advanced registered
  3 20 nurse practitioner who holds a national certification in
  3 21 psychiatric mental health care registered by the board
  3 22 of nursing, or a physician assistant practicing under the
  3 23 supervision of a psychiatrist.  An underserved area is a
  3 24 geographical area designated as a mental health professional
  3 25 shortage area by the Iowa department of public health.
  3 26    Applicants for loan forgiveness payments are required
  3 27 to submit an application and an affidavit of practice to
  3 28 the commission.  A person who is not yet a mental health
  3 29 professional, but who is a resident of Iowa, who has a degree
  3 30 from an accredited postsecondary institution in a degree
  3 31 program that will qualify the person to be licensed as a mental
  3 32 health professional upon completion of a residency program,
  3 33 and who is accepted in an Iowa=based residency program, is
  3 34 also eligible for the program, but must enter into a program
  3 35 agreement with the commission.  Under the program agreement,
  4  1 the individual agrees to engage in full=time practice as a
  4  2 mental health professional, within nine months of completing
  4  3 the Iowa=based residency program, for a period of five
  4  4 consecutive years in an underserved area.
  4  5    The annual amount of loan forgiveness awarded to an
  4  6 individual under the program shall not exceed the resident
  4  7 tuition rate established for regents universities for the first
  4  8 year following the mental health professional's graduation
  4  9 from a graduate school, or 20 percent of the mental health
  4 10 professional's total federally guaranteed Stafford loan
  4 11 amount under the federal family education loan program or the
  4 12 federal direct loan program, including principal and interest,
  4 13 whichever amount is less.
  4 14    The bill creates a mental health professional loan
  4 15 forgiveness fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  4 16 commission for deposit of moneys appropriated to or received by
  4 17 the commission for use under the program. Moneys credited to
  4 18 the fund are appropriated to the commission for purposes of the
  4 19 program and do not revert to any fund of the state at the end of
  4 20 any fiscal year, and interest or earnings on moneys deposited
  4 21 in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
  4 22    The commission shall submit a report to the general assembly
  4 23 by January 1, annually, detailing the number of mental health
  4 24 professionals who received loan forgiveness payments and the
  4 25 amount paid to each recipient, the underserved areas in which
  4 26 they practice or practiced, and other information identified by
