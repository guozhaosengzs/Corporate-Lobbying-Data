  2 19                           EXPLANATION
  2 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 22    This bill modifies the definition of a public utility for
  2 23 purposes of the regulatory authority of the Iowa utilities
  2 24 board.
  2 25    Currently, a "public utility" is defined in Code chapter 476
  2 26 to include any person, partnership, business association, or
  2 27 domestic or foreign corporation owning or operating facilities
  2 28 for the furnishing of specified services to the public for
  2 29 compensation. The services include furnishing gas by piped
  2 30 distribution system, electricity, communications services,
  2 31 and water by piped distribution system. The bill adds to
  2 32 this list the furnishing of sanitary sewage or storm water
  2 33 drainage disposal by piped collection system. The bill
  2 34 provides, however, that in addition to current exclusions
  2 35 from applicability, Code chapter 476 shall not apply to a
  3  1 municipally owned sanitary sewage or storm water drainage
  3  2 system, a sanitary district incorporated and organized pursuant
  3  3 to Code chapter 358, or a levee and drainage district organized
  3  4 pursuant to Code chapter 468.
  3  5    The bill makes conforming changes to include sanitary sewage
  3  6 or storm water collection and treatment in provisions requiring
  3  7 public utilities to furnish reasonably adequate service and
  3  8 facilities and in provisions requiring unrelated business
  3  9 accounting by utilities to the Iowa utilities board.
