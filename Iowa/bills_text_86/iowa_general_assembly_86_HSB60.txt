Code
section

concerning
the

is
amended.
Currently,
moneys
in
the
fund,
among

uses,

can
be
used
for
rehabilitation,
expansion,
or
operating
costs
5


of
group
home
shelters
for
the
homeless
and
domestic
violence
6


shelters.
The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
homeless
7


shelters
be
group
homes
and
eliminates
the
authority
to
use
the
8


money
for
rehabilitation
and
expansion
of
homeless
and
domestic
9


violence
shelters.
The
bill
also
allows
moneys
in
the
fund
10


to
be
used
for
essential
services
for
the
homeless
and
for
11


reporting
of
services
for
the
homeless.
The
bill
eliminates
12


the
ability
of
moneys
to
be
used
to
match
moneys
for
federal
13


funds
for
the
homeless
management
information
system.
The
14


bill
also
increases,
from
2
to
3
percent,
the
percentage
of
15


the
amount
of
moneys
distributed
as
grants
from
the
fund
each
16


fiscal
year
that
may
be
used
for
costs
of
administering
the
17


fund.
18


Code
section
16.41
is
also
amended
to
eliminate
the
19


requirement
that
not
less
than
$546,000
be
spent
annually
20


on
homeless
shelter
projects.
Instead,
the
bill
requires
21


that
each
grant
awarded
from
the
fund
shall
be
awarded
on
22


a
competitive
basis
pursuant
to
procedures,
requirements,
23


priorities,
and
maximum
and
minimum
grant
award
amounts
24


established
by
the
Iowa
finance
authority
for
