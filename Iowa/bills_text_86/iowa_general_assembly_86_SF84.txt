  3 26 thirty days of being served.
  3 27    2.  If an employer or employment agency does not request
  3 28 a hearing pursuant to subsection 1 or if the commissioner

  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill prohibits an employer or employment agency from
  4 19 inquiring about, considering, or requiring disclosure of the
  4 20 criminal record or criminal history of an applicant until the
  4 21 applicant has been determined qualified for the position and
  4 22 notified that the applicant has been selected for an interview
  4 23 by the employer or employment agency. If an interview for
  4 24 the position will not be conducted, the prohibition applies
  4 25 until after a conditional offer of employment is made to the
  4 26 applicant by the employer or employment agency.
  4 27    The prohibition does not apply to positions where employers
  4 28 are required to exclude applicants with certain criminal
  4 29 convictions from employment due to federal or state law. The
  4 30 prohibition also does not apply to positions where a fidelity
  4 31 bond or an equivalent bond is required and an applicant's
  4 32 conviction of one or more specified criminal offenses would
  4 33 disqualify the applicant from obtaining such bond, in which
  4 34 case an employer may include a question or otherwise inquire
  4 35 whether the applicant has ever been convicted of such specified
  5  1 criminal offenses. The bill does not prohibit an employer
  5  2 or employment agency from notifying applicants in writing
  5  3 of specific offenses that will disqualify an applicant from
  5  4 employment in a particular position as permitted by these
  5  5 exceptions.
  5  6    The bill defines "applicant" as a person pursuing employment
  5  7 with an employer or with or through an employment agency.
  5  8 The bill defines "employer" as a person who has 15 or more
  5  9 employees in the current or preceding calendar year and an
  5 10 agent of such a person. The bill defines "employment agency"
  5 11 as a person who, with or without compensation, regularly brings
  5 12 together those desiring to employ and those desiring employment
  5 13 and an agent of such a person.
  5 14    An employer or employment agency that violates the
  5 15 provisions of the bill is subject to civil penalties ranging
  5 16 from a written warning for a first violation to up to $1,500
  5 17 every 30 days for a fourth or subsequent violation not remedied
  5 18 within 90 days.
  5 19    The labor commissioner may hold hearings and investigate
  5 20 alleged violations of the bill by an employer or employment
  5 21 agency and may recover civil penalties according to the
  5 22 provisions of the bill. The bill provides procedures for the
  5 23 recovery of civil penalties.

  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill prohibits an employer or employment agency from
  4 19 inquiring about, considering, or requiring disclosure of the
  4 20 criminal record or criminal history of an applicant until the
  4 21 applicant has been determined qualified for the position and
  4 22 notified that the applicant has been selected for an interview
  4 23 by the employer or employment agency. If an interview for
  4 24 the position will not be conducted, the prohibition applies
  4 25 until after a conditional offer of employment is made to the
  4 26 applicant by the employer or employment agency.
  4 27    The prohibition does not apply to positions where employers
  4 28 are required to exclude applicants with certain criminal
  4 29 convictions from employment due to federal or state law. The
  4 30 prohibition also does not apply to positions where a fidelity
  4 31 bond or an equivalent bond is required and an applicant's
  4 32 conviction of one or more specified criminal offenses would
  4 33 disqualify the applicant from obtaining such bond, in which
  4 34 case an employer may include a question or otherwise inquire
  4 35 whether the applicant has ever been convicted of such specified
  5  1 criminal offenses. The bill does not prohibit an employer
  5  2 or employment agency from notifying applicants in writing
  5  3 of specific offenses that will disqualify an applicant from
  5  4 employment in a particular position as permitted by these
  5  5 exceptions.
  5  6    The bill defines "applicant" as a person pursuing employment
  5  7 with an employer or with or through an employment agency.
  5  8 The bill defines "employer" as a person who has 15 or more
  5  9 employees in the current or preceding calendar year and an
  5 10 agent of such a person. The bill defines "employment agency"
  5 11 as a person who, with or without compensation, regularly brings
  5 12 together those desiring to employ and those desiring employment
  5 13 and an agent of such a person.
  5 14    An employer or employment agency that violates the
  5 15 provisions of the bill is subject to civil penalties ranging
  5 16 from a written warning for a first violation to up to $1,500
  5 17 every 30 days for a fourth or subsequent violation not remedied
  5 18 within 90 days.
  5 19    The labor commissioner may hold hearings and investigate
  5 20 alleged violations of the bill by an employer or employment
  5 21 agency and may recover civil penalties according to the
  5 22 provisions of the bill. The bill provides procedures for the
  5 23 recovery of civil penalties.

  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill prohibits an employer or employment agency from
  4 19 inquiring about, considering, or requiring disclosure of the
  4 20 criminal record or criminal history of an applicant until the
  4 21 applicant has been determined qualified for the position and
  4 22 notified that the applicant has been selected for an interview
  4 23 by the employer or employment agency. If an interview for
  4 24 the position will not be conducted, the prohibition applies
  4 25 until after a conditional offer of employment is made to the
  4 26 applicant by the employer or employment agency.
  4 27    The prohibition does not apply to positions where employers
  4 28 are required to exclude applicants with certain criminal
  4 29 convictions from employment due to federal or state law. The
  4 30 prohibition also does not apply to positions where a fidelity
  4 31 bond or an equivalent bond is required and an applicant's
  4 32 conviction of one or more specified criminal offenses would
  4 33 disqualify the applicant from obtaining such bond, in which
  4 34 case an employer may include a question or otherwise inquire
  4 35 whether the applicant has ever been convicted of such specified
  5  1 criminal offenses. The bill does not prohibit an employer
  5  2 or employment agency from notifying applicants in writing
  5  3 of specific offenses that will disqualify an applicant from
  5  4 employment in a particular position as permitted by these
  5  5 exceptions.
  5  6    The bill defines "applicant" as a person pursuing employment
  5  7 with an employer or with or through an employment agency.
  5  8 The bill defines "employer" as a person who has 15 or more
  5  9 employees in the current or preceding calendar year and an
  5 10 agent of such a person. The bill defines "employment agency"
  5 11 as a person who, with or without compensation, regularly brings
  5 12 together those desiring to employ and those desiring employment
  5 13 and an agent of such a person.
  5 14    An employer or employment agency that violates the
  5 15 provisions of the bill is subject to civil penalties ranging
  5 16 from a written warning for a first violation to up to $1,500
  5 17 every 30 days for a fourth or subsequent violation not remedied
  5 18 within 90 days.
  5 19    The labor commissioner may hold hearings and investigate
  5 20 alleged violations of the bill by an employer or employment
  5 21 agency and may recover civil penalties according to the
  5 22 provisions of the bill. The bill provides procedures for the
  5 23 recovery of civil penalties.

  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill prohibits an employer or employment agency from
  4 19 inquiring about, considering, or requiring disclosure of the
  4 20 criminal record or criminal history of an applicant until the
  4 21 applicant has been determined qualified for the position and
  4 22 notified that the applicant has been selected for an interview
  4 23 by the employer or employment agency. If an interview for
  4 24 the position will not be conducted, the prohibition applies
  4 25 until after a conditional offer of employment is made to the
  4 26 applicant by the employer or employment agency.
  4 27    The prohibition does not apply to positions where employers
  4 28 are required to exclude applicants with certain criminal
  4 29 convictions from employment due to federal or state law. The
  4 30 prohibition also does not apply to positions where a fidelity
  4 31 bond or an equivalent bond is required and an applicant's
  4 32 conviction of one or more specified criminal offenses would
  4 33 disqualify the applicant from obtaining such bond, in which
  4 34 case an employer may include a question or otherwise inquire
  4 35 whether the applicant has ever been convicted of such specified
  5  1 criminal offenses. The bill does not prohibit an employer
  5  2 or employment agency from notifying applicants in writing
  5  3 of specific offenses that will disqualify an applicant from
  5  4 employment in a particular position as permitted by these
  5  5 exceptions.
  5  6    The bill defines "applicant" as a person pursuing employment
  5  7 with an employer or with or through an employment agency.
  5  8 The bill defines "employer" as a person who has 15 or more
  5  9 employees in the current or preceding calendar year and an
  5 10 agent of such a person. The bill defines "employment agency"
  5 11 as a person who, with or without compensation, regularly brings
  5 12 together those desiring to employ and those desiring employment
  5 13 and an agent of such a person.
  5 14    An employer or employment agency that violates the
  5 15 provisions of the bill is subject to civil penalties ranging
  5 16 from a written warning for a first violation to up to $1,500
