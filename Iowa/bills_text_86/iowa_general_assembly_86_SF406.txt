  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
  5  6 the board of the violation. The bill permits the board to
  5  7 compromise a civil penalty and provides factors that the board
  5  8 may consider in determining the amount of a civil penalty.

  3 20                           EXPLANATION
  3 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 23    This bill requires an interconnection customer to install a
  3 24 disconnection device below the electric meter at the location
  3 25 where a new or existing distributed generation facility that is
  3 26 interconnected to an electric distribution system is located.
  3 27    The bill defines "interconnection customer" as a person
  3 28 that interconnects a distributed generation facility to an
  3 29 electric distribution system. The bill defines "distributed
  3 30 generation facility" as a cogeneration facility or a small
  3 31 power production facility that is a qualifying facility
  3 32 under 18 C.F.R. pt. 292, subpt. B, used by an interconnection
  3 33 customer to generate electricity that operates in parallel
  3 34 with the electric distribution system, or an alternate energy
  3 35 purchase facility. The bill defines "disconnection device" as
  4  1 a bypass meter socket and lockable visual disconnect or other
  4  2 disconnection device capable of disconnecting and de=energizing
  4  3 the residual voltage in a distributed generation facility. The
  4  4 bill defines "electric distribution system" as the facilities
  4  5 and equipment owned and operated by an electric utility and
  4  6 used to transmit electricity to ultimate usage points from
  4  7 interchanges with higher voltage transmission networks that
  4  8 transport bulk power over long distances.
  4  9    For a new distributed generation facility, the bill requires
  4 10 an interconnection customer to complete the installation
  4 11 within 10 days after receiving authorization from an electric
  4 12 utility to interconnect the new distributed generation facility
  4 13 to an electric distribution system. The bill requires an
  4 14 interconnection customer to provide written notification to
  4 15 the electric utility that uses the electric meter that the
  4 16 interconnection customer will install a disconnection device
  4 17 before the installation is completed. The bill requires
  4 18 an interconnection customer to permanently affix an emblem
  4 19 or other label to the disconnection device identifying the
  4 20 disconnection device as a disconnection device.
  4 21    The bill requires an interconnection customer to submit
  4 22 certain information relating to the interconnection customer,
  4 23 the distributed generation facility, and the disconnection
  4 24 device to the nearest local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 25 within 10 days of the installation of a disconnection device
  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
  5  6 the board of the violation. The bill permits the board to
  5  7 compromise a civil penalty and provides factors that the board
  5  8 may consider in determining the amount of a civil penalty.
  5  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016.

  3 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 23    This bill requires an interconnection customer to install a
  3 24 disconnection device below the electric meter at the location
  3 25 where a new or existing distributed generation facility that is
  3 26 interconnected to an electric distribution system is located.
  3 27    The bill defines "interconnection customer" as a person
  3 28 that interconnects a distributed generation facility to an
  3 29 electric distribution system. The bill defines "distributed
  3 30 generation facility" as a cogeneration facility or a small
  3 31 power production facility that is a qualifying facility
  3 32 under 18 C.F.R. pt. 292, subpt. B, used by an interconnection
  3 33 customer to generate electricity that operates in parallel
  3 34 with the electric distribution system, or an alternate energy
  3 35 purchase facility. The bill defines "disconnection device" as
  4  1 a bypass meter socket and lockable visual disconnect or other
  4  2 disconnection device capable of disconnecting and de=energizing
  4  3 the residual voltage in a distributed generation facility. The
  4  4 bill defines "electric distribution system" as the facilities
  4  5 and equipment owned and operated by an electric utility and
  4  6 used to transmit electricity to ultimate usage points from
  4  7 interchanges with higher voltage transmission networks that
  4  8 transport bulk power over long distances.
  4  9    For a new distributed generation facility, the bill requires
  4 10 an interconnection customer to complete the installation
  4 11 within 10 days after receiving authorization from an electric
  4 12 utility to interconnect the new distributed generation facility
  4 13 to an electric distribution system. The bill requires an
  4 14 interconnection customer to provide written notification to
  4 15 the electric utility that uses the electric meter that the
  4 16 interconnection customer will install a disconnection device
  4 17 before the installation is completed. The bill requires
  4 18 an interconnection customer to permanently affix an emblem
  4 19 or other label to the disconnection device identifying the
  4 20 disconnection device as a disconnection device.
  4 21    The bill requires an interconnection customer to submit
  4 22 certain information relating to the interconnection customer,
  4 23 the distributed generation facility, and the disconnection
  4 24 device to the nearest local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 25 within 10 days of the installation of a disconnection device
  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
  5  6 the board of the violation. The bill permits the board to
  5  7 compromise a civil penalty and provides factors that the board
  5  8 may consider in determining the amount of a civil penalty.

  3 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 23    This bill requires an interconnection customer to install a
  3 24 disconnection device below the electric meter at the location
  3 25 where a new or existing distributed generation facility that is
  3 26 interconnected to an electric distribution system is located.
  3 27    The bill defines "interconnection customer" as a person
  3 28 that interconnects a distributed generation facility to an
  3 29 electric distribution system. The bill defines "distributed
  3 30 generation facility" as a cogeneration facility or a small
  3 31 power production facility that is a qualifying facility
  3 32 under 18 C.F.R. pt. 292, subpt. B, used by an interconnection
  3 33 customer to generate electricity that operates in parallel
  3 34 with the electric distribution system, or an alternate energy
  3 35 purchase facility. The bill defines "disconnection device" as
  4  1 a bypass meter socket and lockable visual disconnect or other
  4  2 disconnection device capable of disconnecting and de=energizing
  4  3 the residual voltage in a distributed generation facility. The
  4  4 bill defines "electric distribution system" as the facilities
  4  5 and equipment owned and operated by an electric utility and
  4  6 used to transmit electricity to ultimate usage points from
  4  7 interchanges with higher voltage transmission networks that
  4  8 transport bulk power over long distances.
  4  9    For a new distributed generation facility, the bill requires
  4 10 an interconnection customer to complete the installation
  4 11 within 10 days after receiving authorization from an electric
  4 12 utility to interconnect the new distributed generation facility
  4 13 to an electric distribution system. The bill requires an
  4 14 interconnection customer to provide written notification to
  4 15 the electric utility that uses the electric meter that the
  4 16 interconnection customer will install a disconnection device
  4 17 before the installation is completed. The bill requires
  4 18 an interconnection customer to permanently affix an emblem
  4 19 or other label to the disconnection device identifying the
  4 20 disconnection device as a disconnection device.
  4 21    The bill requires an interconnection customer to submit
  4 22 certain information relating to the interconnection customer,
  4 23 the distributed generation facility, and the disconnection
  4 24 device to the nearest local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 25 within 10 days of the installation of a disconnection device
  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
  5  6 the board of the violation. The bill permits the board to
  5  7 compromise a civil penalty and provides factors that the board
  5  8 may consider in determining the amount of a civil penalty.

  3 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 23    This bill requires an interconnection customer to install a
  3 24 disconnection device below the electric meter at the location
  3 25 where a new or existing distributed generation facility that is
  3 26 interconnected to an electric distribution system is located.
  3 27    The bill defines "interconnection customer" as a person
  3 28 that interconnects a distributed generation facility to an
  3 29 electric distribution system. The bill defines "distributed
  3 30 generation facility" as a cogeneration facility or a small
  3 31 power production facility that is a qualifying facility
  3 32 under 18 C.F.R. pt. 292, subpt. B, used by an interconnection
  3 33 customer to generate electricity that operates in parallel
  3 34 with the electric distribution system, or an alternate energy
  3 35 purchase facility. The bill defines "disconnection device" as
  4  1 a bypass meter socket and lockable visual disconnect or other
  4  2 disconnection device capable of disconnecting and de=energizing
  4  3 the residual voltage in a distributed generation facility. The
  4  4 bill defines "electric distribution system" as the facilities
  4  5 and equipment owned and operated by an electric utility and
  4  6 used to transmit electricity to ultimate usage points from
  4  7 interchanges with higher voltage transmission networks that
  4  8 transport bulk power over long distances.
  4  9    For a new distributed generation facility, the bill requires
  4 10 an interconnection customer to complete the installation
  4 11 within 10 days after receiving authorization from an electric
  4 12 utility to interconnect the new distributed generation facility
  4 13 to an electric distribution system. The bill requires an
  4 14 interconnection customer to provide written notification to
  4 15 the electric utility that uses the electric meter that the
  4 16 interconnection customer will install a disconnection device
  4 17 before the installation is completed. The bill requires
  4 18 an interconnection customer to permanently affix an emblem
  4 19 or other label to the disconnection device identifying the
  4 20 disconnection device as a disconnection device.
  4 21    The bill requires an interconnection customer to submit
  4 22 certain information relating to the interconnection customer,
  4 23 the distributed generation facility, and the disconnection
  4 24 device to the nearest local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 25 within 10 days of the installation of a disconnection device
  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
  5  6 the board of the violation. The bill permits the board to
  5  7 compromise a civil penalty and provides factors that the board
  5  8 may consider in determining the amount of a civil penalty.

  3 23    This bill requires an interconnection customer to install a
  3 24 disconnection device below the electric meter at the location
  3 25 where a new or existing distributed generation facility that is
  3 26 interconnected to an electric distribution system is located.
  3 27    The bill defines "interconnection customer" as a person
  3 28 that interconnects a distributed generation facility to an
  3 29 electric distribution system. The bill defines "distributed
  3 30 generation facility" as a cogeneration facility or a small
  3 31 power production facility that is a qualifying facility
  3 32 under 18 C.F.R. pt. 292, subpt. B, used by an interconnection
  3 33 customer to generate electricity that operates in parallel
  3 34 with the electric distribution system, or an alternate energy
  3 35 purchase facility. The bill defines "disconnection device" as
  4  1 a bypass meter socket and lockable visual disconnect or other
  4  2 disconnection device capable of disconnecting and de=energizing
  4  3 the residual voltage in a distributed generation facility. The
  4  4 bill defines "electric distribution system" as the facilities
  4  5 and equipment owned and operated by an electric utility and
  4  6 used to transmit electricity to ultimate usage points from
  4  7 interchanges with higher voltage transmission networks that
  4  8 transport bulk power over long distances.
  4  9    For a new distributed generation facility, the bill requires
  4 10 an interconnection customer to complete the installation
  4 11 within 10 days after receiving authorization from an electric
  4 12 utility to interconnect the new distributed generation facility
  4 13 to an electric distribution system. The bill requires an
  4 14 interconnection customer to provide written notification to
  4 15 the electric utility that uses the electric meter that the
  4 16 interconnection customer will install a disconnection device
  4 17 before the installation is completed. The bill requires
  4 18 an interconnection customer to permanently affix an emblem
  4 19 or other label to the disconnection device identifying the
  4 20 disconnection device as a disconnection device.
  4 21    The bill requires an interconnection customer to submit
  4 22 certain information relating to the interconnection customer,
  4 23 the distributed generation facility, and the disconnection
  4 24 device to the nearest local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 25 within 10 days of the installation of a disconnection device
  4 26 as required by the bill. The state fire marshal is given
  4 27 rulemaking authority relating to the submission of such
  4 28 information. The bill requires that other emergency services
  4 29 personnel or an electric utility be afforded access to the
  4 30 information submitted pursuant to the bill upon request.
  4 31    The bill requires a local paid or volunteer fire department
  4 32 to maintain a registry of information received pursuant to
  4 33 the bill for the purpose of alerting fire fighters responding
  4 34 to an emergency situation that a location is equipped with a
  4 35 distributed generation facility and that reasonable precautions
  5  1 may be necessary when responding to the emergency situation.
  5  2    An interconnection customer who violates the requirements of
  5  3 the bill is subject to a civil penalty from the utilities board
  5  4 of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 per violation,
  5  5 if the violation is not remedied after written notice by
