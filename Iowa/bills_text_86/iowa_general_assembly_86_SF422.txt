  6  7                           EXPLANATION
  6  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    This bill relates to vehicle recyclers, including the
  6 11 transfer of motor vehicles to vehicle recyclers and compliance
  6 12 with the national motor vehicle title information system.
  6 13    The bill provides that the owner of a motor vehicle that does
  6 14 not have a certificate of title or a junking certificate may
  6 15 dispose of the vehicle to a vehicle recycler licensed under
  6 16 Code chapter 321H for scrap or junk if the vehicle is 12 model
  6 17 years old or older and has a fair market value of less than
  6 18 $1,000. The bill exempts vehicles disposed of this way from
  6 19 certain title application, delivery, surrender, and transfer
  6 20 requirements.
  6 21    The bill defines "national motor vehicle title information
  6 22 system" (NMVTIS) as the federally mandated motor vehicle title
  6 23 history database maintained by the United States department of
  6 24 justice that links the states' motor vehicle title records,
  6 25 including the department of transportation's title records, and
  6 26 that requires the reporting of junk and salvage motor vehicles
  6 27 in order to ensure that states, law enforcement agencies,
  6 28 insurers, and consumers have access to information that enables
  6 29 the verification of a vehicle's history, and the accuracy and
  6 30 legality of a motor vehicle's title, before a purchase or title
  6 31 transfer occurs.
  6 32    The bill requires applicants seeking to become an authorized
  6 33 vehicle recycler to provide proof of registration with the
  6 34 NMVTIS.  In addition, the bill requires a vehicle recycler
  6 35 license to state the licensee's registration number for the
  7  1 NMVTIS.
  7  2    The bill requires a licensed vehicle recycler subject to
  7  3 federal regulations relating to the NMVTIS to register with
  7  4 the NMVTIS, and for any vehicle purchased by the vehicle
  7  5 recycler, to comply with the federal reporting requirements
  7  6 within two business days of purchasing the vehicle. Records
  7  7 of the vehicle recycler's compliance shall be kept by the
  7  8 vehicle recycler for at least three years after the purchase
  7  9 of the vehicle, and shall be open for inspection by any peace
  7 10 officer during normal business hours. The bill provides that
  7 11 the department of transportation shall adopt rules to implement
  7 12 these provisions, including but not limited to rules requiring
  7 13 the submission and retention of records not required by federal
  7 14 regulations relating to the NMVTIS.  These requirements do
  7 15 not apply to a vehicle that has been crushed or flattened by
  7 16 mechanical means in such a way that it no longer resembles the
  7 17 vehicle described by the certificate of title if the vehicle
  7 18 recycler who purchased the vehicle verifies that the seller of
  7 19 the vehicle has met the requirements. The bill provides that
  7 20 the department of transportation shall adopt rules relating
  7 21 to the form of the verification, and the manner in which the
  7 22 verification shall be retained. A violation for failing to
  7 23 comply with the reporting requirements of the NMVTIS within two
  7 24 business days of purchasing a vehicle is a simple misdemeanor
  7 25 punishable by a fine of at least $250, but not more than
  7 26 $1,500, or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days. A violation of
  7 27 the remaining provisions is a serious misdemeanor punishable
  7 28 by a fine of at least $315, but not more than $1,875, and
  7 29 imprisonment not to exceed one year.
  7 30    The bill provides that an authorized vehicle recycler
  7 31 license, or an application for such a license, may be denied,
  7 32 revoked, or suspended if the department of transportation finds
  7 33 that the licensee has not complied with the provisions of the
  7 34 bill or with federal regulations relating to the NMVTIS.
  7 35    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016.
