 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the

 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each

 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the

 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing

 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 23    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
 11 24 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating

 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the

 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the

 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air

 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 17 this Act.
 11 18    Sec. 6.  TRANSFER OF MONEYS.  Any moneys remaining in the
 11 19 air contaminant source fund, as created in section 455B.133B,
 11 20 on the effective date of this Act, shall be transferred to the

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and

 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for

 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing

 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 10 33 accounts:
 10 34    1.  For the air contaminant source fund, the operating permit
 10 35 application fee account as provided in section 455B.133B,
 11  1 subsection 6, as enacted in this Act.
 11  2    2.  For the air quality fund, any of the following:

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating

 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable

 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the

 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's

 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating

 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating

 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of

 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must

 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of

 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's

 10 32 this Act to be credited to any of the following funds or
 10 33 accounts:
 10 34    1.  For the air contaminant source fund, the operating permit
 10 35 application fee account as provided in section 455B.133B,
 11  1 subsection 6, as enacted in this Act.
 11  2    2.  For the air quality fund, any of the following:

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 10 12 implementing and administering the asbestos national emission
 10 13 standard for hazardous air pollutants program as specified in
 10 14 paragraph "b".

 10 22 an account of the fund at the end of each state fiscal year
 10 23 shall be retained in that account.
 10 24    c.  Notwithstanding section 12C.7, any interest and earnings
 10 25 on investments from moneys in an account of the fund shall be
 10 26 credited to that account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 21 air emission fee account established within the air contaminant
 11 22 source fund as provided in this Act.
 11 23    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
 11 24 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 10 13 standard for hazardous air pollutants program as specified in
 10 14 paragraph "b".

 10 18    9.  a.  The commission or department shall not transfer
 10 19 moneys credited from one account to another account of the
 10 20 fund.
 10 21    b.  Notwithstanding section 8.33, any unexpended balance in
 10 22 an account of the fund at the end of each state fiscal year
 10 23 shall be retained in that account.

 10 28 455B.133B, as amended in this Act, or section 455B.133C, as
 10 29 enacted in this Act, the environmental protection commission
 10 30 may establish a designated fee effective on and after January
 10 31 1, 2016. A designated fee is limited to a fee required under
 10 32 this Act to be credited to any of the following funds or
 10 33 accounts:
 10 34    1.  For the air contaminant source fund, the operating permit
 10 35 application fee account as provided in section 455B.133B,

 11 10 fee established by the environmental protection commission
 11 11 pursuant to section 455B.133, subsection 8, which is in effect
 11 12 immediately prior to the effective date of this Act shall
 11 13 remain in effect and shall be subject to the provisions of this
 11 14 Act.  The fee amount for such a fee in effect immediately prior
 11 15 to the effective date of this Act shall remain in effect until
 11 16 such fee amount is adjusted by the commission as provided in
 11 17 this Act.
 11 18    Sec. 6.  TRANSFER OF MONEYS.  Any moneys remaining in the
 11 19 air contaminant source fund, as created in section 455B.133B,
 11 20 on the effective date of this Act, shall be transferred to the
 11 21 air emission fee account established within the air contaminant
 11 22 source fund as provided in this Act.
 11 23    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
 11 24 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 20 on the effective date of this Act, shall be transferred to the
 11 21 air emission fee account established within the air contaminant
 11 22 source fund as provided in this Act.
 11 23    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
 11 24 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the

 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be

 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 10 10    d.  Moneys in the asbestos account are appropriated to the
 10 11 department to pay for reasonable direct and indirect costs of
 10 12 implementing and administering the asbestos national emission
 10 13 standard for hazardous air pollutants program as specified in
 10 14 paragraph "b".
 10 15    8.  Fees established pursuant to this section shall not be
 10 16 imposed for the regulation of an activity that exceeds the
 10 17 requirements of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
 10 18    9.  a.  The commission or department shall not transfer
 10 19 moneys credited from one account to another account of the
 10 20 fund.
 10 21    b.  Notwithstanding section 8.33, any unexpended balance in
 10 22 an account of the fund at the end of each state fiscal year
 10 23 shall be retained in that account.
 10 24    c.  Notwithstanding section 12C.7, any interest and earnings
 10 25 on investments from moneys in an account of the fund shall be
 10 26 credited to that account.
 10 27    Sec. 4.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF FEES.  Notwithstanding section
 10 28 455B.133B, as amended in this Act, or section 455B.133C, as
 10 29 enacted in this Act, the environmental protection commission
 10 30 may establish a designated fee effective on and after January
 10 31 1, 2016. A designated fee is limited to a fee required under
 10 32 this Act to be credited to any of the following funds or
 10 33 accounts:
 10 34    1.  For the air contaminant source fund, the operating permit
 10 35 application fee account as provided in section 455B.133B,
 11  1 subsection 6, as enacted in this Act.
 11  2    2.  For the air quality fund, any of the following:

 11  7    c.  The asbestos account as provided in section 455B.133C,
 11  8 subsection 7, as enacted in this Act.
 11  9    Sec. 5.  CONTINUING EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING FEES.  Any
 11 10 fee established by the environmental protection commission
 11 11 pursuant to section 455B.133, subsection 8, which is in effect
 11 12 immediately prior to the effective date of this Act shall
 11 13 remain in effect and shall be subject to the provisions of this
 11 14 Act.  The fee amount for such a fee in effect immediately prior
 11 15 to the effective date of this Act shall remain in effect until
 11 16 such fee amount is adjusted by the commission as provided in
 11 17 this Act.
 11 18    Sec. 6.  TRANSFER OF MONEYS.  Any moneys remaining in the
 11 19 air contaminant source fund, as created in section 455B.133B,
 11 20 on the effective date of this Act, shall be transferred to the
 11 21 air emission fee account established within the air contaminant
 11 22 source fund as provided in this Act.
 11 23    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
 11 24 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section

 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 12 immediately prior to the effective date of this Act shall

 11 20 on the effective date of this Act, shall be transferred to the
 11 21 air emission fee account established within the air contaminant

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11  9    Sec. 5.  CONTINUING EFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING FEES.  Any
 11 10 fee established by the environmental protection commission
 11 11 pursuant to section 455B.133, subsection 8, which is in effect
 11 12 immediately prior to the effective date of this Act shall
 11 13 remain in effect and shall be subject to the provisions of this

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.
 13 16    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 25                           EXPLANATION
 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
 13  2 the federal Clean Air Act.  It also prohibits the transfer of
 13  3 moneys between accounts within the same fund, requires that the
 13  4 unexpended balance in an account of the fund at the end of each
 13  5 state fiscal year be retained in that account, and requires
 13  6 that any interest and earnings on investments from moneys in an
 13  7 account of the fund shall be credited to that account.
 13  8    The bill allows the commission to establish fees to be
 13  9 credited to the new accounts of the two funds on or after
 13 10 January 1, 2016.  It also provides that any current fees in
 13 11 effect immediately prior to the bill's effective date are to
 13 12 remain in effect until adjusted by the commission.  Finally,
 13 13 moneys remaining in the air contaminant source fund on the
 13 14 effective date of the bill are to be transferred to the fund's
 13 15 air emission fee account.

 11 17 this Act.
 11 18    Sec. 6.  TRANSFER OF MONEYS.  Any moneys remaining in the
 11 19 air contaminant source fund, as created in section 455B.133B,

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation

 11 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 28    This bill provides for fees established by the environmental
 11 29 protection commission (commission) and imposed and collected by
 11 30 the department of natural resources (DNR) under division II of
 11 31 Code chapter 455B, relating to regulations on air quality and
 11 32 closely associated with the federal Clean Air Act. The bill
 11 33 relates to the current fee imposed upon regulated pollutants
 11 34 (Code section 455B.133(8)), including under the operating
 11 35 permit program.  It also provides for the establishment of
 12  1 a new operating permit application fee.  Both of these fees
 12  2 are to be credited to newly created accounts within the
 12  3 existing air contaminant source fund created in Code section
 12  4 455B.133B, the air emission fee account and the operating
 12  5 permit application fee account.
 12  6    In addition, the bill provides for three other new fees: for
 12  7 accepting applications for new source review permits submitted
 12  8 by major sources;  accepting applications submitted by minor air
 12  9 contaminant sources for construction permits or for providing
 12 10 for registrations, permits by rule, or template permits in
 12 11 lieu of obtaining construction permits under minor source
 12 12 new source review programs; and for accepting notifications
 12 13 involving demolition or renovation projects associated with
 12 14 asbestos.  These new fees are to be credited to each of three
 12 15 corresponding accounts established within a new air quality
 12 16 fund, including the major source account, the minor source
 12 17 account, and the asbestos account.
 12 18    The bill provides that if the commission establishes a fee,
 12 19 it must also establish a fee amount based on DNR's calculated
 12 20 estimate of total revenues from the fee predicted to be
 12 21 credited to the corresponding account sufficient to provide for
 12 22 the reasonable direct and indirect costs of implementing and
 12 23 administering regulations associated with that fee during the
 12 24 state fiscal year, but not to exceed a ceiling amount.  DNR
 12 25 must recompute its calculated estimate prior to each state
 12 26 fiscal year (July 1 through June 30) and obtain approval
 12 27 from the commission if an established fee amount must be
 12 28 adjusted for the next state fiscal year.  In addition, DNR must
 12 29 annually convene stakeholder meetings at which invitees make
 12 30 recommendations regarding the DNR's required annual computation
 12 31 of a fee amount to be credited to each account.  Moneys in each
 12 32 account are appropriated to DNR to provide for the reasonable
 12 33 direct and indirect costs of implementing and administering
 12 34 regulations associated with that account.
 12 35    The bill prohibits fees from being imposed for the
 13  1 regulation of an activity that exceeds the requirements of
