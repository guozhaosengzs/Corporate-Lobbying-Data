The
bill
provides

two
individual

tax
incentives

relating

First,
2


an

allowed

subtract

individual
3


income
tax

amount
of
contributions
made
during

year
4


to
the
account
holder’s
account,
not
to
exceed
$3,000
per
5


individual,
or
$6,000
for
a
married
couple
with
a
joint
account
6


and
filing
a
joint
income
tax
return.
If
the
account
holder
7


contributes
more
than
that
amount,
the
excess
may
be
subtracted
8


in
a
subsequent
tax
year
provided
the
total
exemption
in
any
9


one
tax
year
does
not
exceed
$3,000
or
$6,000,
as
applicable.
10


Second,
the
bill
exempts
any
interest
or
earnings
received
from
11


an
account
holder’s
account.
Both
the
contribution
exemption
12


and
interest
exemption
only
apply
for
the
first
10
years
after
13


the
account
holder
establishes
an
account.
14


The
bill
requires
an
account
holder
to
add
to
net
income
the
15


amount
of
withdrawal
from
an
account
that
was
made
for
purposes
16


other
than
eligible
costs
of
the
account
holder
to
the
extent
17


it
was
previously
subtracted
as
a
contribution.
Any
amount
18


remaining
in
an
account
on
the
day
after
an
account
holder
19
