the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
the
commission
of
a
class
“A”
felony
by
2


a
person
under
18
years
of
age,
and
provides
penalties.
3


Current
Iowa
statutory
law
provides
that
a
person
under
4


18
years
of
age
who
commits
a
class
“A”
felony,
other
than
5


murder
in
the
first
degree,
shall
be
eligible
for
parole
after
6


serving
a
minimum
term
of
confinement
of
25
years.
Also,
under
7


current
Iowa
statutory
law,
a
person
under
18
years
of
age
who
8


commits
murder
in
the
first
degree
must
serve
a
life
sentence
9


without
the
possibility
of
parole
which
equals
the
sentences
10


of
other
class
“A”
felons.
However,
the
United
States
Supreme
11


Court
in
Miller
v.
Alabama,
132
S.
Ct.
2455
(2012),
has
ruled
12


that
a
mandatory
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
13


parole
for
a
person
under
18
years
of
age
who
commits
murder
14


is
unconstitutional.
In
addition,
the
Iowa
Supreme
Court
in
15


State
v.
Lyle,
854
N.W.2d
378
(Iowa
2014),
ruled
that
the
Iowa
16


Constitution
forbids
a
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
schema
for
17


juvenile
offenders
that
deprives
the
district
court
of
the
18


discretion
to
consider
youth
and
its
attendant
circumstances
19


as
mitigating
factors.
20


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
commits
murder
in
the
21


first
degree
and
who
was
under
the
age
of
18
at
the
time
the
22


offense
was
committed
shall
be
sentenced
to
serve
one
of
three
23


sentencing
options.
The
first
option
provides
that
the
court
24


sentence
the
person
to
confinement
for
the
rest
of
the
person’s
25


life
with
no
possibility
of
parole
unless
the
governor
commutes
26


the
sentence
to
a
term
of
years.
The
second
option
provides
27


that
the
court
sentence
the
person
to
confinement
for
the
rest
28


of
the
person’s
life
with
the
possibility
of
parole
after
29


serving
a
minimum
term
of
confinement
of
35
years.
Under
the
30


third
option,
the
court
sentences
the
person
to
confinement
for
31


the
rest
of
the
person’s
life
with
the
possibility
of
parole.
32


The
bill
lists
numerous
circumstances
for
the
court
to
33


consider
prior
to
sentencing
a
person
who
commits
murder
in
the

with

Under

13


for
the

The

This

list

the

must
consider
for
a

who
