  1  1 A Concurrent Resolution requesting the Congress of
  1  2    the United States to repeal the federal Act of
  1  3    June 30, 1948, that conferred on the State of Iowa
  1  4    jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against
  1  5    Indians on the Meskwaki Settlement.
  1  6    WHEREAS, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi
  1  7 in Iowa (the Meskwaki) is a federally recognized tribe
  1  8 organized in accordance with Section 16 of the federal
  1  9 Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat.
  1 10 984, as amended by the federal Act of June 15, 1935, 49
  1 11 Stat. 378, under a Constitution and Bylaws approved by
  1 12 the Secretary of the Interior on December 20, 1937; and
  1 13    WHEREAS, in 1857, the Meskwaki purchased 80 acres
  1 14 in Tama County which was held in trust by the State of
  1 15 Iowa as permitted by then Governor James Grimes and
  1 16 for the next 30 years the Meskwaki governed themselves
  1 17 virtually free from interference from both the federal
  1 18 and state governments; and
  1 19    WHEREAS, the jurisdictional status of the Meskwaki
  1 20 during this period of time was unclear as the tribe was
  1 21 recognized by the federal government but also had a
  1 22 continuing relationship with the State of Iowa due to
  1 23 the Meskwaki's private ownership of land which was held
  1 24 in trust by the Governor of the State of Iowa; and
  1 25    WHEREAS, in 1895, in order to clear up any
  1 26 ambiguities, the State of Iowa ceded to the federal
  1 27 government all jurisdiction over the Meskwaki with the
  1 28 stipulation that nothing in the transfer of the tribal
  2  1 lands would prevent the State of Iowa from exercising
  2  2 jurisdiction over crimes against the laws of Iowa
  2  3 committed either by Indians or others on the Meskwaki
  2  4 Settlement; and
  2  5    WHEREAS, during what is now known as the Indian
  2  6 Termination Era, the United States government tried to
  2  7 end its trusteeship over Indian reservations throughout
  2  8 the country  and in part passed the federal Act of June
  2  9 30, 1948, which conferred jurisdiction over criminal
  2 10 offenses committed on the Meskwaki Settlement to the
  2 11 State of Iowa; and
  2 12    WHEREAS, the federal Act of June 30, 1948, was
  2 13 passed at a time when there was a perception that
  2 14 there was lawlessness on the Meskwaki Settlement and
  2 15 an absence of adequate tribal institutions for law
  2 16 enforcement; and
  2 17    WHEREAS, the passage of the federal Act of June 30,
  2 18 1948, provided no federal funding to the State of Iowa
  2 19 to assume this responsibility which has amounted to an
  2 20 unfunded federal mandate and the resulting cost over
  2 21 the years has been unfairly borne by the taxpayers of
  2 22 Tama County; and
  2 23    WHEREAS, in the past 67 years much has changed at
  2 24 the federal, state, and tribal levels in the area of
  2 25 criminal law enforcement and in the development of laws
  2 26 in general on the Meskwaki Settlement; and
  2 27    WHEREAS, the federal Tribal Law and Order Act of
  2 28 2010, Pub. L. No. 111=211, authorized Indian tribes
  2 29 to expand the prosecution and punishment of criminal
  2 30 offenders if certain due process requirements were
  3  1 followed; and
  3  2    WHEREAS, Indian tribes have recently achieved more
  3  3 authority to prosecute criminal offenses committed
  3  4 on tribal lands as evidenced by the enactment of the
  3  5 federal Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act
  3  6 of 2013, Pub. L. No. 113=4, which for the first time
  3  7 allowed tribal enforcement over non=natives who commit
  3  8 domestic violence on tribal lands; and
  3  9    WHEREAS, the State of Iowa was the first in the
  3 10 nation to pass Native American grave protection
  3 11 legislation, commonly known as the Iowa Graves
  3 12 Protection Act, 1976 Iowa Acts, ch. 1158, {7, that
  3 13 came into law before the federal version and before
  3 14 the more recent passage of Iowa's Recognition and
  3 15 Enforcement of Tribal Civil Judgments Act, 2007 Iowa
  3 16 Acts, ch. 192, which followed the development of the
  3 17 Meskwaki Tribal Court System in 2005, with its first
  3 18 case being tried in 2006, and 2003 state legislation,
  3 19 2003 Iowa Acts, ch. 87, recognizing the Meskwaki Tribal
  3 20 Police and allowing them to  participate in the Iowa Law
  3 21 Enforcement Academy and to become state certified; and
  3 22    WHEREAS, the Meskwaki has greatly enhanced at
  3 23 its own expense the tribe's criminal justice system
  3 24 and now provides a fully functioning court system
  3 25 through the establishment of a state certified police
  3 26 force, legally trained and licensed public defenders,
  3 27 prosecutors and judges, and a full=time probation
  3 28 officer, and provides for the publication of its tribal
  3 29 laws; and
  3 30    WHEREAS, the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault
  4  1 and the Iowa Coalition against Domestic Violence have
  4  2 noted that the victims of domestic violence on the
  4  3 Meskwaki Settlement prefer that prosecution and other
  4  4 court services be handled by the tribal court of the
  4  5 Meskwaki Settlement; NOW THEREFORE,
  4  6    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, THE HOUSE OF
  4  7 REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, That the Iowa General
  4  8 Assembly urges the members of the United States Senate
  4  9 and the United States House of Representatives to
  4 10 repeal the Act of June 30, 1948, Pub. L. No. 846,
  4 11 62 Stat. 1161, which conferred on the State of Iowa
  4 12 jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against
  4 13 Indians on the Meskwaki Settlement and to take whatever
  4 14 steps are necessary to achieve such a repeal; and

  1 11 Stat. 378, under a Constitution and Bylaws approved by

  1 13    WHEREAS, in 1857, the Meskwaki purchased 80 acres
  1 14 in Tama County which was held in trust by the State of
  1 15 Iowa as permitted by then Governor James Grimes and
  1 16 for the next 30 years the Meskwaki governed themselves
  1 17 virtually free from interference from both the federal
  1 18 and state governments; and
  1 19    WHEREAS, the jurisdictional status of the Meskwaki
  1 20 during this period of time was unclear as the tribe was
  1 21 recognized by the federal government but also had a
  1 22 continuing relationship with the State of Iowa due to
  1 23 the Meskwaki's private ownership of land which was held
  1 24 in trust by the Governor of the State of Iowa; and
  1 25    WHEREAS, in 1895, in order to clear up any

  2 10 offenses committed on the Meskwaki Settlement to the
  2 11 State of Iowa; and
  2 12    WHEREAS, the federal Act of June 30, 1948, was
  2 13 passed at a time when there was a perception that
  2 14 there was lawlessness on the Meskwaki Settlement and
  2 15 an absence of adequate tribal institutions for law
  2 16 enforcement; and
  2 17    WHEREAS, the passage of the federal Act of June 30,
  2 18 1948, provided no federal funding to the State of Iowa
  2 19 to assume this responsibility which has amounted to an
  2 20 unfunded federal mandate and the resulting cost over
  2 21 the years has been unfairly borne by the taxpayers of
  2 22 Tama County; and
  2 23    WHEREAS, in the past 67 years much has changed at
  2 24 the federal, state, and tribal levels in the area of

  3  1 followed; and
  3  2    WHEREAS, Indian tribes have recently achieved more

  3 11 legislation, commonly known as the Iowa Graves
  3 12 Protection Act, 1976 Iowa Acts, ch. 1158, {7, that

  1 13    WHEREAS, in 1857, the Meskwaki purchased 80 acres
  1 14 in Tama County which was held in trust by the State of
  1 15 Iowa as permitted by then Governor James Grimes and
  1 16 for the next 30 years the Meskwaki governed themselves
  1 17 virtually free from interference from both the federal
  1 18 and state governments; and
  1 19    WHEREAS, the jurisdictional status of the Meskwaki
  1 20 during this period of time was unclear as the tribe was
  1 21 recognized by the federal government but also had a
  1 22 continuing relationship with the State of Iowa due to
  1 23 the Meskwaki's private ownership of land which was held
  1 24 in trust by the Governor of the State of Iowa; and
  1 25    WHEREAS, in 1895, in order to clear up any
  1 26 ambiguities, the State of Iowa ceded to the federal

  2 12    WHEREAS, the federal Act of June 30, 1948, was
  2 13 passed at a time when there was a perception that

  2 15 an absence of adequate tribal institutions for law
  2 16 enforcement; and
  2 17    WHEREAS, the passage of the federal Act of June 30,
  2 18 1948, provided no federal funding to the State of Iowa

  2 22 Tama County; and

  3  7 allowed tribal enforcement over non=natives who commit
  3  8 domestic violence on tribal lands; and

  3 11 legislation, commonly known as the Iowa Graves
  3 12 Protection Act, 1976 Iowa Acts, ch. 1158, {7, that

  3 26 force, legally trained and licensed public defenders,

  3 28 officer, and provides for the publication of its tribal
