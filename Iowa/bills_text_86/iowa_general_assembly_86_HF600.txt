  1  1    Section 1.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The general assembly
  1  2 finds and recognizes all of the following:
  1  3    1.  Access to health care facilities and health care
  1  4 professionals is critically important to the citizens of Iowa.
  1  5    2.  Telehealth uses electronic technology to overcome a
  1  6 geographic distance between patients and health care providers
  1  7 for the purpose of intervention, clinical management, or
  1  8 assessing, monitoring, or educating patients.
  1  9    3.  The provision of telehealth results in demonstrated
  1 10 cost=effectiveness, improvements in disease management,
  1 11 and improved  patient outcomes and studies by the American
  1 12 telemedicine association and others have demonstrated
  1 13 significant reductions in hospitalizations and otherwise
  1 14 necessary medical care as a result of telehealth intervention.
  1 15    4.  Geography, weather, availability of specialists,
  1 16 transportation, and other factors can create barriers to
  1 17 accessing appropriate health care, including behavioral health
  1 18 care, and one way to provide, ensure, or enhance access to
  1 19 care given these barriers is through the appropriate use of
  1 20 technology to allow health care consumers access to qualified
  1 21 health care professionals.
  1 22    5.  Additionally, the utilization of telehealth will
  1 23 further the maintenance and improvement of the physical
  1 24 and economic health of patients in medically underserved
  1 25 communities by retaining the source of health care in local
  1 26 areas, strengthening the health infrastructure, and preserving
  1 27 health=care=related jobs.
  1 28    6.  A need exists in this state to embrace efforts that
  1 29 will encourage health insurers and health care professionals
  1 30 to support the use of telehealth and that will also encourage
  1 31 all state  agencies to evaluate and amend their policies and
  1 32 rules to remove any regulatory barriers prohibiting the use of
  1 33 telehealth.
  1 34    7.  Recognition exists that the full potential of delivering
  1 35 health care services through telehealth cannot be realized
  2  1 without the assurance of payment and the resolution of existing
  2  2 legal and policy barriers to such payment.
  2  3    8.  The purpose of the Iowa telehealth Act is to provide a
  2  4 framework for health care professionals to utilize in providing
  2  5 telehealth to Iowans in a manner that provides efficient and
  2  6 effective access to quality health care.

  1  1    Section 1.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The general assembly
  1  2 finds and recognizes all of the following:
  1  3    1.  Access to health care facilities and health care
  1  4 professionals is critically important to the citizens of Iowa.
  1  5    2.  Telehealth uses electronic technology to overcome a
  1  6 geographic distance between patients and health care providers
  1  7 for the purpose of intervention, clinical management, or
  1  8 assessing, monitoring, or educating patients.
  1  9    3.  The provision of telehealth results in demonstrated
  1 10 cost=effectiveness, improvements in disease management,
  1 11 and improved  patient outcomes and studies by the American
  1 12 telemedicine association and others have demonstrated
  1 13 significant reductions in hospitalizations and otherwise
  1 14 necessary medical care as a result of telehealth intervention.
  1 15    4.  Geography, weather, availability of specialists,
  1 16 transportation, and other factors can create barriers to
  1 17 accessing appropriate health care, including behavioral health
  1 18 care, and one way to provide, ensure, or enhance access to
  1 19 care given these barriers is through the appropriate use of
  1 20 technology to allow health care consumers access to qualified
  1 21 health care professionals.
  1 22    5.  Additionally, the utilization of telehealth will
  1 23 further the maintenance and improvement of the physical
  1 24 and economic health of patients in medically underserved
  1 25 communities by retaining the source of health care in local
  1 26 areas, strengthening the health infrastructure, and preserving
  1 27 health=care=related jobs.
  1 28    6.  A need exists in this state to embrace efforts that
  1 29 will encourage health insurers and health care professionals
  1 30 to support the use of telehealth and that will also encourage
  1 31 all state  agencies to evaluate and amend their policies and
  1 32 rules to remove any regulatory barriers prohibiting the use of
  1 33 telehealth.
  1 34    7.  Recognition exists that the full potential of delivering
  1 35 health care services through telehealth cannot be realized
  2  1 without the assurance of payment and the resolution of existing
  2  2 legal and policy barriers to such payment.
  2  3    8.  The purpose of the Iowa telehealth Act is to provide a
  2  4 framework for health care professionals to utilize in providing
  2  5 telehealth to Iowans in a manner that provides efficient and
  2  6 effective access to quality health care.

  4 27    Sec. 5.    4 22    7.  If a health care professional provides services pursuant
  4 23 to and in compliance with section 135.24 via telehealth in
  4 24 accordance with this chapter, the provisions of section 135.24
  4 25 including those relating to immunity from civil liability shall
  4 26 apply to such health care professional.
  4 27    Sec. 5.    4 23 to and in compliance with section 135.24 via telehealth in
  4 24 accordance with this chapter, the provisions of section 135.24

  4 29 of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  4 30 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  4 31 surgical coverage benefits may provide coverage for services
  4 32 provided as telehealth if the services would be covered if
  4 33 provided in=person. If coverage is provided for telehealth
  4 34 under this section, coverage shall not require in=person
  4 35 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  5  1 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  5  2 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  5  3 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  5  4 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  5  5 If coverage is provided under this section, health care
  5  6 services provided through in=person consultations or through

  5  9    2.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  5 10 this section, all of the following shall apply:

  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 13 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 23 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  5 34 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 35 is not appropriate.
  6  1    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  6  2 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  6  3 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  4 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2016:

  6 10 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  6 11    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  6 12 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  6 13 law.
  6 14    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  6 15 employees.
  6 16    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified

  6 25 to chapter 17A as necessary to administer this section.
  6 26    4.  For the purposes of this section, "health care
  6 27 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  6 28 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  6 29    Sec. 6.  MEDICAID PROGRAM ==== REIMBURSEMENT FOR
  6 30 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 31 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
  6 32 Medicaid program.  The rules shall provide that in=person
  6 33 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 34 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  6 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  7 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  7  8 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  7  9    Sec. 7.  STUDY ON USE OF TELEHEALTH.  The department of
  7 10 public health, in collaboration with the department of human
  7 11 services,  shall convene and conduct a study regarding options
  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement. The division of insurance of the department of
  7 14 commerce shall be available for consultation as needed.  The
  7 15 department of public health shall submit a final report of its
  7 16 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general
  7 17 assembly by December 15, 2015.
  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  4 32 provided as telehealth if the services would be covered if
  4 33 provided in=person. If coverage is provided for telehealth
  4 34 under this section, coverage shall not require in=person
  4 35 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  5  1 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  5  2 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  5  3 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  5  4 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  5  5 If coverage is provided under this section, health care
  5  6 services provided through in=person consultations or through
  5  7 telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services for the
  5  8 purposes of coverage.
  5  9    2.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  5 10 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  5 11    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth

  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of

  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil

  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided

  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  5  2 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  5  3 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable

  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.

  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.

  6 30 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 31 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 14 commerce shall be available for consultation as needed.  The
  7 15 department of public health shall submit a final report of its
  7 16 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not

  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.

  6 30 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 31 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

  6 34 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  6 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  7 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  7  8 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  7  9    Sec. 7.  STUDY ON USE OF TELEHEALTH.  The department of
  7 10 public health, in collaboration with the department of human
  7 11 services,  shall convene and conduct a study regarding options
  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement. The division of insurance of the department of
  7 14 commerce shall be available for consultation as needed.  The

  7 16 findings and recommendations to the governor and the general

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5  6 services provided through in=person consultations or through

  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.

  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5  5 If coverage is provided under this section, health care
  5  6 services provided through in=person consultations or through
  5  7 telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services for the
  5  8 purposes of coverage.
  5  9    2.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  5 10 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  5 11    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 13 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 23 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  5 34 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 35 is not appropriate.
  6  1    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  6  2 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,

  6 10 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  6 11    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,

  6 33 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 34 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5  5 If coverage is provided under this section, health care
  5  6 services provided through in=person consultations or through
  5  7 telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services for the
  5  8 purposes of coverage.
  5  9    2.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  5 10 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  5 11    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 13 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 23 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  5 34 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 35 is not appropriate.
  6  1    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  6  2 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  6  3 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  4 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2016:

  6 10 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  6 11    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  6 12 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  6 13 law.
  6 14    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  5  8 purposes of coverage.
  5  9    2.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  5 10 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  5 11    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  5 12 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 13 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 14 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 23 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  5 34 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 35 is not appropriate.
  6  1    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  6  2 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  6  3 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  6 13 law.
  6 14    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not

  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance

 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  5 15 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 16 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 17 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 18 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 19 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 20 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 21    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 22 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 23 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 24 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 25 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 26    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 33 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth

  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided

  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides

  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5 27 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  5 28 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  5 29 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  5 30 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 31 when delivered in person.
  5 32    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and

  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises

  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations

  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings

  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to

  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to

 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  5 34 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 35 is not appropriate.
  6  1    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the

  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the

  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises

  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the

  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and

  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises

  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a

  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not

  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for

  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not

  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the

 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are

  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the

  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules

  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within

  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions

  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  6 33 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 34 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 35 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  7  1 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  2 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  3 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  4 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  5 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by
 10 30 December 15, 2015.

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a

  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or

  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums

  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the

  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope

  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the

  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a

  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to

  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided

 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person

 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of

  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the

  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements

  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil

  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to

  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health

  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and

  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises

  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and

  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may

  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient

 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are

 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision

  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not

  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.
 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 18 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 19 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 20 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to
 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 10 26 division of insurance is required to be available for
 10 27 consultation as needed. The department of public health
 10 28 is directed to submit a final report of its findings and
 10 29 recommendations to the governor and the general assembly by

  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and

  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.

  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,

  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.

 10 10    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 11 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 12 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 13 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 14 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 17 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the

 10 21 reimbursement.
 10 22    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 10 23 collaboration with the department of human services, to

  7 18                           EXPLANATION
  7 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  8 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  9 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9 10 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 11 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 12 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 13 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 14 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 15    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 16 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 21 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 26    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 27 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 28 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 31 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
 10  1 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  4    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
 10  5 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
 10  6 those exempt from its application.
 10  7    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10  8 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10  9 provision.

 10 24 convene and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 10 25 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 21    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 22 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 23 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 24 definitions.
  7 25    The bill provides that a health care professional, as
  7 26 appropriate to the scope of practice of the profession, may
  7 27 employ the technology of telehealth by applying telehealth
  7 28 within the professional's scope of practice or by employing
  7 29 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision
  7 30 of another health care professional who is using telehealth
  7 31 technology within the supervising professional's scope
  7 32 of practice. A health care professional's employment of
  7 33 telehealth technology under the direction and supervision of
  7 34 another health care professional who is acting within that
  7 35 health care professional's scope of practice shall not be
  8  1 interpreted as practicing the supervising professional's health
  8  2 care profession without a license. A health care professional
  8  3 employing telehealth technology must hold a current valid
  8  4 license and must be trained, educated, and knowledgeable
  8  5 regarding the health care service provided and technology
  8  6 used and is prohibited from performing duties for which the
  8  7 professional does not have sufficient training, education, and
  8  8 knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training, education, and
  8  9 knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by the respective
  8 10 board.
  8 11    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 12 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 13 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 14 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 15 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 16    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 17 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 18 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 19 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 20 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services
  8 21 is appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not
  8 22 to be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions
  8 23 of the health care professionals licensure or to alter the
  8 24 scope of practice of any health care professional,  authorize
  8 25 the delivery of health care services in a setting or manner
  8 26 not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a patient's right
  8 27 to choose in=person contact with a health care professional
  8 28 for the delivery of health care services for which telehealth
  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health
  8 32 care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of Code
  8 33 section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from civil
  8 34 liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  9  2 surgical coverage benefits may cover telehealth. If telehealth
  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 17 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 18 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 20 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the

  9 22 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 23 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 24 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 25 contract, policy, or plan.

  8 29 is available. The bill also provides that if a health care
  8 30 professional provides services pursuant to and in compliance
  8 31 with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer health

  8 35    The bill provides that a contract, policy, or plan providing
  9  1 for third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or

  9  3 coverage is provided on or after January 1, 2016, the contract,
  9  4 policy, or plan shall not deny coverage on the basis that the
  9  5 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  9  6 covered if provided in person and shall not require in=person
  9  7 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 32 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 33 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 34 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 35 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to

 10  2 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  3 telehealth is not appropriate.

 10 15 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 16 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  9 29 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 30 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
