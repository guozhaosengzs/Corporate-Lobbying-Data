  9 30                           EXPLANATION
  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill provides for the legal sale and use of novelties
  9 34 and consumer fireworks within the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 10  1 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 10  2 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 10  3 of fireworks.
 10  4    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 10  5 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 10  6 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 10  7 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 10  8 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 10  9 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 10 10 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 10 11 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 10 12 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 10 13 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 10 14 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 10 15 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 10 16 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 10 17 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 10 18 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 10 19 substance with limited exceptions.
 10 20    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 10 21 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 10 22 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 10 23 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 10 24    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 10 25 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 10 26 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 10 27 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 10 28 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 10 29 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 10 30 a $400 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 10 31 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 10 32 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 10 33 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 10 34 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 10 35 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $200.
 11  1 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 11  2 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $200. The
 11  3 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $25 for retailers
 11  4 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 11  5 fireworks.
 11  6    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 11  7 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 11  8 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 11  9 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 11 10 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 11 11 and public liability insurance. Under the bill, the state fire
 11 12 marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed retailers
 11 13 and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at conforming
 11 14 permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at conforming
 11 15 temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each year.
 11 16    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 11 17 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 11 18 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 11 19 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 11 20 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 11 21 consumer fireworks seller license fee fund under the control
 11 22 of the state fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the
 11 23 fees collected for the licensing of retailers and community
 11 24 groups. The fund is required to be used for administration
 11 25 and enforcement of the state fire marshal's consumer fireworks
 11 26 related duties and to provide grants to local fire protection
 11 27 and emergency medical service providers.
 11 28    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing provision
 11 29 established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 11 30 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 11 31 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 11 32 than $625, or by both.
 11 33    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 11 34 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 11 35 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  1 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 12  2 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 12  3 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 12  4 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 12  5 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 12  6 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill provides for the legal sale and use of novelties
  9 34 and consumer fireworks within the state.
  9 35    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 10  1 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 10  2 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 10  3 of fireworks.
 10  4    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 10  5 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 10  6 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 10  7 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 10  8 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 10  9 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 10 10 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 10 11 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 10 12 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 10 13 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 10 14 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 10 15 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 10 16 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 10 17 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 10 18 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 10 19 substance with limited exceptions.
 10 20    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 10 21 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 10 22 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 10 23 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 10 24    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 10 25 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 10 26 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 10 27 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 10 28 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 10 29 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 10 30 a $400 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 10 31 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 10 32 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 10 33 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 10 34 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 10 35 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $200.
 11  1 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 11  2 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $200. The
 11  3 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $25 for retailers
 11  4 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 11  5 fireworks.
 11  6    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 11  7 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 11  8 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 11  9 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 11 10 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 11 11 and public liability insurance. Under the bill, the state fire
 11 12 marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed retailers
 11 13 and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at conforming
 11 14 permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at conforming
 11 15 temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each year.
 11 16    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 11 17 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 11 18 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 11 19 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 11 20 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 11 21 consumer fireworks seller license fee fund under the control
 11 22 of the state fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the
 11 23 fees collected for the licensing of retailers and community
 11 24 groups. The fund is required to be used for administration
 11 25 and enforcement of the state fire marshal's consumer fireworks
 11 26 related duties and to provide grants to local fire protection
 11 27 and emergency medical service providers.
 11 28    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing provision
 11 29 established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 11 30 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 11 31 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 11 32 than $625, or by both.
 11 33    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 11 34 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 11 35 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  1 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 12  2 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 12  3 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 12  4 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 12  5 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 12  6 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 12  7 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of a least $250.
 12  8    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 12  9 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 12 10 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 12 11 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety.  The
 12 12 bill also provides that a county board of supervisors may adopt
 12 13 a resolution to suspend the use of display fireworks. The bill
 12 14 provides that a person who violates such an order by the state
 12 15 fire marshal or resolution of a county board of supervisors
 12 16 commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least
 12 17 $250.
 12 18    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use
 12 19 or explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the
 12 20 use or explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than
 12 21 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on

 12 24 use or explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except
 12 25 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following
 12 26 day. The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a
 12 27 person on the real property of another person unless the owner
 12 28 of the real property has consented to such use. Under the
 12 29 bill, a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 12 30 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not
 12 31 more than $500.
 12 32    The bill will take effect June 1, 2015.
