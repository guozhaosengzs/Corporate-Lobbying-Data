Interstate
medical
licensure
1


compact.

1.
Purpose.
3


a.
In
order
to
strengthen
access
to
health
care,
and
in
4


recognition
of
the
advances
in
the
delivery
of
health
care,
5


the
member
states
of
the
interstate
medical
licensure
compact
6


have
allied
in
common
purpose
to
develop
a
comprehensive
7


process
that
complements
the
existing
licensing
and
regulatory
8


authority
of
state
medical
boards
and
provides
a
streamlined
9


process
that
allows
physicians
to
become
licensed
in
multiple
10


states,
thereby
enhancing
the
portability
of
a
medical
license
11


and
ensuring
the
safety
of
patients.
The
compact
creates
12


another
pathway
for
licensure
and
does
not
otherwise
change
13


a
state’s
existing
medical
practice
act.
The
compact
also
14


adopts
the
prevailing
standard
for
licensure
and
affirms
that
15


the
practice
of
medicine
occurs
where
the
patient
is
located
16


at
the
time
of
the
physician-patient
encounter,
and
therefore,
17


requires
the
physician
to
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
18


state
medical
board
where
the
patient
is
located.
19


b.
State
medical
boards
that
participate
in
the
compact
20


retain
the
jurisdiction
to
impose
an
adverse
action
against
21


a
license
to
practice
medicine
in
that
state
issued
to
a
22


physician
through
the
procedures
in
the
compact.
