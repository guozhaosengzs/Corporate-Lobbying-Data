  1 34 watersheds:
  1 35    a.  Not more than two regional watersheds designated by the
  2  1 water resources coordinating council.
  2  2    b.  The Raccoon river watershed.
  2  3    2.  The water quality goal of each regional watershed and
  2  4 clean water program is to reduce nitrates, nitrites, or other
  2  5 contaminants as designated by the division, in cooperation with
  2  6 the department, in untreated surface waters of each selected
  2  7 watershed so that by January 1, 2032, nitrates, nitrites, or
  2  8 other designated contaminants in those surface waters do not
  2  9 exceed the maximum contaminant levels established by the United
  2 10 States environmental protection agency under the Safe Drinking
  2 11 Water Act as defined in section 455B.291.
  2 12    3.  a.  The division, in cooperation with the department,
  2 13 shall adopt a regional watershed and clean water program
  2 14 plan for each of the three selected watersheds described in
  2 15 subsection 1.  The plan shall do all of the following:
  2 16    (1)  To the extent feasible, use existing data and amend,
  2 17 augment, and consolidate existing plans or strategies which
  2 18 have improved or which promise to improve watershed management
  2 19 strategies for the selected watershed.
  2 20    (2)  Provide water quality objectives to be achieved by
  2 21 dates identified in the plan in order to meet the selected
  2 22 watershed's water quality goal described in subsection 2.
  2 23    (3)  Provide a framework for improving water quality by
  2 24 administering regional watershed and clean water projects.
  2 25    b.  The division shall cooperate with the department,
  2 26 interested government bodies, landowners, and stakeholders in
  2 27 adopting each regional watershed and clean water program plan.
  2 28 The division, in cooperation with the department, shall conduct
  2 29 public hearings throughout each selected watershed prior to and
  2 30 during the duration of the watershed and clean water program in
  2 31 order to do all of the following:
  2 32    (1)  Educate persons residing within the selected watershed
  2 33 regarding the regional watershed and clean water program.
  2 34    (2)  Recruit persons to participate in regional watershed
  2 35 and clean water projects.
  3  1    (3)  Receive comments regarding how to establish and improve
  3  2 the program or administer the projects.
  3  3    4.  The division shall be responsible for the implementation
  3  4 of regional watershed and clean water projects on cropland
  3  5 and pastureland within each selected watershed.  A project
  3  6 may include but is not limited to in=field and edge=of=field
  3  7 practices, wetland restoration and construction, vegetated
  3  8 buffer strips, and other management practices.
  3  9    5.  The department, in cooperation with the division, shall
  3 10 be responsible for the implementation of watershed and clean
  3 11 water projects within cities and other communities within
  3 12 each selected watershed.  A project may include but is not
  3 13 limited to improving wastewater, sewer and septic tank systems,
  3 14 storm water drainage, or sewage treatment services for both
  3 15 sewered and unsewered communities, including incorporated and
  3 16 unincorporated communities.
  3 17    6.  In establishing and administering regional watershed
  3 18 and clean water projects, the division and department shall
  3 19 identify and actively seek participation from persons who
  3 20 in the aggregate contribute at least ninety percent of the
  3 21 maximum contaminant levels. A person may participate in a
  3 22 project on a voluntary basis by entering into an agreement
  3 23 with either the division under subsection 4 or the department
  3 24 under subsection 5.  An agreement may provide for the award of
  3 25 financial incentives to the participating person, which may be
  3 26 in the form of a loan, grant, or cost=share basis arrangement
  3 27 as determined by the division or department who enters into the
  3 28 agreement with the person.
  3 29    7.  The division, in cooperation with the department, shall
  3 30 regularly monitor the surface water quality in each selected
  3 31 watershed to measure progress in achieving the  objectives
  3 32 of the regional watershed and clean water program plan as
  3 33 described in subsection 3.
  3 34    8.  a.  The division, in cooperation with the department,
  3 35 shall prepare and submit interim reports to the governor and

  4  4 governor and general assembly by January 15, 2032.
  4  5    b.  A report shall include all of the following:
  4  6    (1)  A description and update of the current status of the
  4  7 regional watershed and clean water programs and projects, and

  4  9 and projects.
  4 10    (2)  An evaluation of the successes and failures of each
  4 11 program and project in meeting the program's water quality
  4 12 objectives and the  water quality goal.  If a program has failed
  4 13 to meet an objective, the report shall recommend methods to
  4 14 improve the program, including but not limited to amending
  4 15 statutes, administrative rules, or the program's plan.

  6 32 that provides for the assessment and reduction of nutrients
  6 33 in this state's watersheds, including regional watersheds
  6 34 (Code section 466B.42).  The bill provides programs to support

  7  6 soil conservation and water quality and (2) the water quality
  7  7 initiative fund for communities administered by the department
  7  8 of natural resources. The goal for each program is to reduce
  7  9 nitrates, nitrites, or other contaminants designated by the
  7 10 division so that by January 1, 2032, contaminants in surface
  7 11 waters do not exceed the maximum contaminant levels established
  7 12 by the United States environmental protection agency under the

  6 31    This bill relates to the state's water quality initiative
  6 32 that provides for the assessment and reduction of nutrients
  6 33 in this state's watersheds, including regional watersheds
  6 34 (Code section 466B.42).  The bill provides programs to support

  7  3 appropriates moneys for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015,
  7  4 and ending June 30, 2016, to two funds: (1) the water quality
  7  5 initiative fund for agriculture administered by the division of
  7  6 soil conservation and water quality and (2) the water quality
  7  7 initiative fund for communities administered by the department
  7  8 of natural resources. The goal for each program is to reduce
  7  9 nitrates, nitrites, or other contaminants designated by the
  7 10 division so that by January 1, 2032, contaminants in surface
  7 11 waters do not exceed the maximum contaminant levels established
  7 12 by the United States environmental protection agency under the
  7 13 Safe Drinking Water Act. The division, in cooperation with

  7  4 and ending June 30, 2016, to two funds: (1) the water quality
  7  5 initiative fund for agriculture administered by the division of
  7  6 soil conservation and water quality and (2) the water quality
  7  7 initiative fund for communities administered by the department
  7  8 of natural resources. The goal for each program is to reduce
  7  9 nitrates, nitrites, or other contaminants designated by the
  7 10 division so that by January 1, 2032, contaminants in surface
  7 11 waters do not exceed the maximum contaminant levels established
  7 12 by the United States environmental protection agency under the
  7 13 Safe Drinking Water Act. The division, in cooperation with
