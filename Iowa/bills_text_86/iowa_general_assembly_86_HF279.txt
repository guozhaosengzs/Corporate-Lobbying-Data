  4 15 days' written notice by restricted certified mail stating the

  4 19 product is a synthetic substance under the bill, a retailer
  4 20 or a person, who has received notice of such a hearing,
  4 21 shall be assessed a civil penalty, if the retailer or person

  4 32 action relating to the bill.
