  2 23 containing the following:
  2 24    a.  The signatures of at least twenty=five percent of
  2 25 all owners of property within the proposed district. These

  3  1 the operation tax.
  3  2    e.  The purpose of the establishment of the district, which
  3  3 may be stated generally or in terms of the relationship of the
  3  4 property within the district or the interests of the owners of
  3  5 property within the district or in terms of the improvements
  3  6 proposed to be undertaken for the purposes of the district.
  3  7    f.  A statement that taxes levied for the municipal park
  3  8 improvement district operation fund shall be used for the
  3  9 purpose of paying maintenance expenses of improvements for a

  3 11 the taxes are to be used for this maintenance purpose.
  3 12    3.  a.  The council shall notify the city planning commission
  3 13 upon receipt of a petition. It shall be the duty of the city
  3 14 planning commission to make recommendations to the council in
  3 15 regard to the proposed district. The city planning commission
  3 16 shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative report for
  3 17 the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The
  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has
  3 20 received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 21 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,
  3 22 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council
  3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional
  3 27 planning commission shall have the same duties set forth
  3 28 in this subsection as the city planning commission. If no
  3 29 metropolitan or regional planning commission exists, the
  3 30 council shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of
  3 31 a petition, and the zoning commission shall have the same
  3 32 duties set forth in this subsection as the city planning
  3 33 commission. If no planning or zoning commission exists, the
  3 34 council shall set a time and place for holding a public hearing
  3 35 on establishment of a district upon receipt of a petition and
  4  1 shall publish notice of the hearing as provided in section
  4  2 362.3.
  4  3    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report, or after
  4  4 the public hearing if applicable, the council shall set a time
  4  5 and place for a meeting at which the council proposes to take
  4  6 action for the establishment of the district and shall publish
  4  7 notice of the meeting as provided in section 362.3. The clerk
  4  8 shall send a copy of the notice by certified mail not less
  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:
  4 19    a.  That a petition has been filed with the council asking
  4 20 that a district be established.
  4 21    b.  The name of the district.
  4 22    c.  The purpose of the district.
  4 23    d.  The property proposed to be included in the district.
  4 24    e.  The maximum rates of tax which may be imposed upon the
  4 25 property in the district.
  4 26    6.  At the time and place set in the notice the council
  4 27 shall hear all owners of property in the proposed district or
  4 28 residents of the city desiring to express their views. The
  4 29 council must wait at least thirty days after the meeting has
  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members
  5  7 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5  8 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5  9 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the
  5 29 district has the relationship required and includes all of the
  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.
  5 32    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal
  5 33 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  5 34 establishment of the district and the levying of the proposed
  5 35 taxes for the district, to the district court of the county
  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the
  6 16 procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or
  6 17 the procedural steps for the authorization of any tax or any
  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    2  6 by action of the city council in accordance with the provisions
  2  7 of this chapter. A district shall:
  2  8    a.  Be comprised of contiguous property wholly within the
  2  9 boundaries of the city. A district shall be comprised only
  2 10 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
  2 11 industrial uses.
  2 12    b.  Be given a descriptive name containing the words
  2 13 "municipal park improvement district".
  2 14    c.  Be comprised of property related in some manner,

  2 16 location, condition, or relationship to an area, so as to be

  2 18 from present or potential use or enjoyment of the property,
  2 19 by the operation of the district or of any improvement of the
  2 20 district.

  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:
  4 19    a.  That a petition has been filed with the council asking
  4 20 that a district be established.
  4 21    b.  The name of the district.

  4 29 council must wait at least thirty days after the meeting has
  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members
  5  7 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5  8 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5  9 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the
  5 29 district has the relationship required and includes all of the
  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.
  5 32    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal
  5 33 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  5 34 establishment of the district and the levying of the proposed
  5 35 taxes for the district, to the district court of the county
  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the
  6 16 procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or
  6 17 the procedural steps for the authorization of any tax or any
  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    2  7 of this chapter. A district shall:
  2  8    a.  Be comprised of contiguous property wholly within the

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the

  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property

  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the

  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.

  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has

  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,

  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members
  5  7 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5  8 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at

  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an

  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance

  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district

  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty

  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of

  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the

  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the

  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty

  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the

  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide

  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.

  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:
  4 19    a.  That a petition has been filed with the council asking
  4 20 that a district be established.
  4 21    b.  The name of the district.
  4 22    c.  The purpose of the district.
  4 23    d.  The property proposed to be included in the district.
  4 24    e.  The maximum rates of tax which may be imposed upon the

  4 26    6.  At the time and place set in the notice the council

  4 28 residents of the city desiring to express their views. The
  4 29 council must wait at least thirty days after the meeting has
  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members
  5  7 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5  8 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5  9 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the
  5 29 district has the relationship required and includes all of the
  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the
  6 16 procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or
  6 17 the procedural steps for the authorization of any tax or any
  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    2 34 of tax may be stated in terms of separate maximum rates for the
  2 35 debt service tax, the park improvement capital fund tax, and

  3  6 proposed to be undertaken for the purposes of the district.
  3  7    f.  A statement that taxes levied for the municipal park
  3  8 improvement district operation fund shall be used for the
  3  9 purpose of paying maintenance expenses of improvements for a
  3 10 specified length of time, along with any options to renew, if
  3 11 the taxes are to be used for this maintenance purpose.
  3 12    3.  a.  The council shall notify the city planning commission
  3 13 upon receipt of a petition. It shall be the duty of the city
  3 14 planning commission to make recommendations to the council in
  3 15 regard to the proposed district. The city planning commission
  3 16 shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative report for
  3 17 the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The
  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has
  3 20 received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 21 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,
  3 22 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council
  3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional
  3 27 planning commission shall have the same duties set forth

  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the

  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the

  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.

  3 15 regard to the proposed district. The city planning commission
  3 16 shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative report for
  3 17 the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The
  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has
  3 20 received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 21 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,

  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council

  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the

  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.

  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.

  3 17 the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The
  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has
  3 20 received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 21 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,

  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to

  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference

  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:

  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of

  3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional
  3 27 planning commission shall have the same duties set forth
  3 28 in this subsection as the city planning commission. If no
  3 29 metropolitan or regional planning commission exists, the
  3 30 council shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of
  3 31 a petition, and the zoning commission shall have the same
  3 32 duties set forth in this subsection as the city planning
  3 33 commission. If no planning or zoning commission exists, the
  3 34 council shall set a time and place for holding a public hearing
  3 35 on establishment of a district upon receipt of a petition and
  4  1 shall publish notice of the hearing as provided in section
  4  2 362.3.
  4  3    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report, or after
  4  4 the public hearing if applicable, the council shall set a time
  4  5 and place for a meeting at which the council proposes to take
  4  6 action for the establishment of the district and shall publish
  4  7 notice of the meeting as provided in section 362.3. The clerk
  4  8 shall send a copy of the notice by certified mail not less
  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:
  4 19    a.  That a petition has been filed with the council asking
  4 20 that a district be established.
  4 21    b.  The name of the district.
  4 22    c.  The purpose of the district.
  4 23    d.  The property proposed to be included in the district.
  4 24    e.  The maximum rates of tax which may be imposed upon the

  4 26    6.  At the time and place set in the notice the council
  4 27 shall hear all owners of property in the proposed district or
  4 28 residents of the city desiring to express their views. The
  4 29 council must wait at least thirty days after the meeting has
  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members
  5  7 of the council, the affirmative vote of two members. However,
  5  8 if a remonstrance has been filed with the clerk signed by at
  5  9 least twenty=five percent of all owners of property within the
  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the
  5 29 district has the relationship required and includes all of the
  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.
  5 32    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal
  5 33 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  5 34 establishment of the district and the levying of the proposed
  5 35 taxes for the district, to the district court of the county
  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the
  6 16 procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or
  6 17 the procedural steps for the authorization of any tax or any
  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    3 15 regard to the proposed district. The city planning commission
  3 16 shall, with due diligence, prepare an evaluative report for
  3 17 the council on the merit and feasibility of the project. The
  3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has
  3 20 received the report of the city planning commission. In
  3 21 addition to its report, the commission may, from time to time,
  3 22 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council
  3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional
  3 27 planning commission shall have the same duties set forth
  3 28 in this subsection as the city planning commission. If no
  3 29 metropolitan or regional planning commission exists, the
  3 30 council shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of
  3 31 a petition, and the zoning commission shall have the same
  3 32 duties set forth in this subsection as the city planning
  3 33 commission. If no planning or zoning commission exists, the
  3 34 council shall set a time and place for holding a public hearing
  3 35 on establishment of a district upon receipt of a petition and
  4  1 shall publish notice of the hearing as provided in section
  4  2 362.3.
  4  3    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report, or after
  4  4 the public hearing if applicable, the council shall set a time
  4  5 and place for a meeting at which the council proposes to take
  4  6 action for the establishment of the district and shall publish
  4  7 notice of the meeting as provided in section 362.3. The clerk
  4  8 shall send a copy of the notice by certified mail not less
  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.

  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:
  4 19    a.  That a petition has been filed with the council asking
  4 20 that a district be established.
  4 21    b.  The name of the district.
  4 22    c.  The purpose of the district.

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the
  5  6 members of the council, or, in cities having but three members

  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty

  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the

  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone

  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the

  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the

  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.
  5 32    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to

  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    3 18 council shall not hold its public hearings or take further
  3 19 action on the establishment of the district until it has

  3 22 recommend to the council amendments and changes relating to the
  3 23 project.
  3 24    b.  If no city planning commission exists, the council
  3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district

  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another

  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional
  3 27 planning commission shall have the same duties set forth

  4  3    4.  Upon receipt of the commission's final report, or after

  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.
  4 17    5.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting for
  4 18 hearing on the petition, the notice must state the following:

  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district
  4 33 need not be included in the established district. However, the
  4 34 council may not include property in the district that was not
  4 35 included in the petition until the council has held another
  5  1 meeting after it has published notice and mailed notice to
  5  2 owners of the additional property, as required in subsection 4,
  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the

  5 10 proposed district representing ownership of property with an
  5 11 assessed value of twenty=five percent or more of the assessed
  5 12 value of all of the property in the proposed district, the
  5 13 adoption of the ordinance requires a unanimous vote of the
  5 14 council.

  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a
  5 21 petition objecting to establishing such district is filed with
  5 22 the city clerk containing the signatures of at least forty
  5 23 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
  5 24 or signatures which together represent ownership of property
  5 25 with an assessed value of forty percent or more of the assessed
  5 26 value of all property within the proposed district.
  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the

  6  1 in which any part of the district is located within thirty
  6  2 days after the date upon which the ordinance establishing the
  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to
  6 10 the ability of the city to levy taxes in accordance with the
  6 11 ordinance establishing the district after thirty days from the
  6 12 date on which the ordinance establishing the district becomes
  6 13 effective.
  6 14    12.  The procedural steps for the petitioning and
  6 15 establishment of the district may be combined with the
  6 16 procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement or

  6 18 combination thereof.
  6 19    13.  The rate of debt service tax referred to in the petition
  6 20 and the ordinance establishing the district shall only restrict
  6 21 the amount of bonds which may be issued and shall not limit the
  6 22 ability of the city to levy as necessary in subsequent years
  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.

  5 27    10.  The adoption of an ordinance establishing a district
  5 28 is a legislative determination that the property within the
  5 29 district has the relationship required and includes all of the
  5 30 property within the area that has that relationship in the
  5 31 district.
  5 32    11.  Any resident or property owner of the city may appeal
  5 33 the action and the decisions of the council, including the
  5 34 establishment of the district and the levying of the proposed

  6  3 district becomes effective, but the action and decision of
  6  4 the council are final and conclusive unless the court finds
  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to

  6 23 to pay interest and amortize the principal of that amount of
  6 24 bonds.
  6 25    14.  The ordinance establishing the district may provide
  6 26 for the division of all of the property within the district
  6 27 into two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference
  6 28 in the relationship of the property or the interest of its
  6 29 owners, whether the difference is qualitative or quantitative.
  6 30 The ordinance establishing the district and establishing the
  6 31 different zones may establish a different maximum rate of tax
  6 32 for each zone or may provide that the rate of tax for a zone
  6 33 shall be a certain set percentage of the maximum rate of tax
  6 34 specified in the ordinance for levy in the district.
  6 35    Sec. 4.    3 25 shall notify the metropolitan or regional planning commission
  3 26 upon receipt of a petition, and such metropolitan or regional

  3 30 council shall notify the zoning commission upon receipt of
  3 31 a petition, and the zoning commission shall have the same
  3 32 duties set forth in this subsection as the city planning
  3 33 commission. If no planning or zoning commission exists, the

  3 35 on establishment of a district upon receipt of a petition and
  4  1 shall publish notice of the hearing as provided in section

  4  9 than fifteen days before the meeting to each owner of property
  4 10 within the proposed district at the owner's address as shown by
  4 11 the records of the county auditor. If a property is shown to be
  4 12 in the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address,
  4 13 a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at that
  4 14 address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not grounds for
  4 15 objection to the council taking any action authorized in this
  4 16 chapter.

  4 29 council must wait at least thirty days after the meeting has
  4 30 been held before it may adopt an ordinance establishing a
  4 31 district meeting the requirements of section 386A.3, subsection
  4 32 1. Property included in the petition proposing the district

  5  3 and containing the information required in subsection 5.
  5  4    7.  Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district
  5  5 requires the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the

  5 14 council.
  5 15    8.  The city clerk shall cause a copy of the ordinance to be
  5 16 filed in the office of the county recorder of each county in
  5 17 which any property within the district is located.
  5 18    9.  At any time prior to adoption of an ordinance
  5 19 establishing a district, the entire matter of establishing such
  5 20 district shall be withdrawn from council consideration if a

  6  5 that the council exceeded its authority. An action may not
  6  6 be brought questioning the regularity of the proceedings
  6  7 pertaining to the establishment of a district or to the
  6  8 validity of the district or to the propriety of the inclusion
  6  9 or exclusion of any property within or from the district or to

 16  3                           EXPLANATION
 16  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16  6    This bill relates to municipal park improvements by
 16  7 authorizing the establishment of municipal park improvement
 16  8 districts, the issuance of municipal park improvement district
 16  9 bonds, and the imposition of specified taxes.
 16 10    Under new Code chapter 386A, a municipal park improvement
 16 11 district (district) may be established by action of the
 16 12 city council for the purpose of undertaking improvements
 16 13 within the district. The bill defines "improvement" to be
 16 14 the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
 16 15 improvement, and equipping of recreation grounds, recreation
 16 16 buildings, juvenile playgrounds, swimming pools, recreation
 16 17 centers, and parks, and the acquisition of real estate
 16 18 therefor.
 16 19    A district must be comprised of contiguous property
 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only
 16 21 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
 16 22 industrial uses, and be comprised of property related in some
 16 23 manner, including but not limited to present or potential use,
 16 24 physical location, condition, or relationship to an area so
 16 25 as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited
 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16  2 specifically referred to and made applicable by this chapter.

 16  3                           EXPLANATION
 16  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16  6    This bill relates to municipal park improvements by
 16  7 authorizing the establishment of municipal park improvement
 16  8 districts, the issuance of municipal park improvement district
 16  9 bonds, and the imposition of specified taxes.
 16 10    Under new Code chapter 386A, a municipal park improvement
 16 11 district (district) may be established by action of the
 16 12 city council for the purpose of undertaking improvements
 16 13 within the district. The bill defines "improvement" to be
 16 14 the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
 16 15 improvement, and equipping of recreation grounds, recreation
 16 16 buildings, juvenile playgrounds, swimming pools, recreation
 16 17 centers, and parks, and the acquisition of real estate
 16 18 therefor.
 16 19    A district must be comprised of contiguous property
 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only
 16 21 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
 16 22 industrial uses, and be comprised of property related in some
 16 23 manner, including but not limited to present or potential use,
 16 24 physical location, condition, or relationship to an area so
 16 25 as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited
 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is

 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16  3                           EXPLANATION
 16  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16  6    This bill relates to municipal park improvements by
 16  7 authorizing the establishment of municipal park improvement
 16  8 districts, the issuance of municipal park improvement district
 16  9 bonds, and the imposition of specified taxes.
 16 10    Under new Code chapter 386A, a municipal park improvement
 16 11 district (district) may be established by action of the
 16 12 city council for the purpose of undertaking improvements
 16 13 within the district. The bill defines "improvement" to be
 16 14 the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
 16 15 improvement, and equipping of recreation grounds, recreation
 16 16 buildings, juvenile playgrounds, swimming pools, recreation
 16 17 centers, and parks, and the acquisition of real estate
 16 18 therefor.
 16 19    A district must be comprised of contiguous property
 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only
 16 21 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
 16 22 industrial uses, and be comprised of property related in some
 16 23 manner, including but not limited to present or potential use,
 16 24 physical location, condition, or relationship to an area so
 16 25 as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited
 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter

 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16  6    This bill relates to municipal park improvements by
 16  7 authorizing the establishment of municipal park improvement
 16  8 districts, the issuance of municipal park improvement district
 16  9 bonds, and the imposition of specified taxes.
 16 10    Under new Code chapter 386A, a municipal park improvement
 16 11 district (district) may be established by action of the
 16 12 city council for the purpose of undertaking improvements
 16 13 within the district. The bill defines "improvement" to be
 16 14 the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
 16 15 improvement, and equipping of recreation grounds, recreation
 16 16 buildings, juvenile playgrounds, swimming pools, recreation
 16 17 centers, and parks, and the acquisition of real estate
 16 18 therefor.
 16 19    A district must be comprised of contiguous property
 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only
 16 21 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
 16 22 industrial uses, and be comprised of property related in some
 16 23 manner, including but not limited to present or potential use,
 16 24 physical location, condition, or relationship to an area so
 16 25 as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited
 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25

 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is

 16 11 district (district) may be established by action of the
 16 12 city council for the purpose of undertaking improvements
 16 13 within the district. The bill defines "improvement" to be
 16 14 the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
 16 15 improvement, and equipping of recreation grounds, recreation
 16 16 buildings, juvenile playgrounds, swimming pools, recreation
 16 17 centers, and parks, and the acquisition of real estate

 16 19    A district must be comprised of contiguous property
 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only

 16 23 manner, including but not limited to present or potential use,
 16 24 physical location, condition, or relationship to an area so
 16 25 as to be benefited in any manner, including but not limited
 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at

 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.

 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of

 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which

 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at

 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the

 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16 20 wholly within the boundaries of the city, be comprised only
 16 21 of property that is zoned for residential, commercial, or
 16 22 industrial uses, and be comprised of property related in some

 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.

 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the

 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which

 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed

 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16 26 to a benefit from present or potential use or enjoyment of
 16 27 the property, by the operation of the district or of any
 16 28 improvement of the district.
 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting

 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed

 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are

 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the

 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is

 16 29    The proceedings for establishing a district are initiated
 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be

 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park

 16 30 upon the filing of a petition containing the signatures of at
 16 31 least 25 percent of all owners of property within the proposed
 16 32 district. These signatures must together represent ownership
 16 33 of property with an assessed value of 25 percent or more of the
 16 34 assessed value of all of the property in the proposed district.
 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is

 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in

 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 16 35 The petition must also, in part, include a description of the
 17  1 boundaries of the proposed district or a description of the
 17  2 property within the proposed district, the name of the proposed
 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend

 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must

 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be

 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for

 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in

 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the

 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,

 17  3 district, a statement of the maximum rate of tax that may be
 17  4 imposed upon property within the district, and the purpose of
 17  5 the establishment of the district.
 17  6    Following receipt of a petition, the city council must
 17  7 notify the city planning commission. It is the duty of
 17  8 the city planning commission to make recommendations to the
 17  9 council in regard to the proposed district. The bill provides
 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.
 18 24    The council shall initiate proceedings for a proposed park
 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend

 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the

 18 25 improvement in a district upon receipt of a petition signed
 18 26 by at least 25 percent of all owners of property within the
 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies

 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 17 10 alternative review procedures if the city does not have a city
 17 11 planning commission.
 17 12    Upon receipt of the planning commission's final report, the
 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for

 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in

 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.

 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.

 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.

 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is
 20 16 located.

 17 13 city council is to set a time and place for a meeting at which
 17 14 the council proposes to take action for the establishment of
 17 15 the district.  In addition to the time and place of the meeting
 17 16 for hearing on the petition, the notice of the meeting must
 17 17 state that a petition has been filed with the council asking
 17 18 that a district be established, the name of the district, the
 17 19 purpose of the district, the property proposed to be included
 17 20 in the district, and the maximum rate of tax which may be
 17 21 imposed upon the property in the district.
 17 22    At the meeting, the city council is required to hear all
 17 23 owners of property in the proposed district or residents of
 17 24 the city desiring to express their views. The council must
 17 25 wait at least 30 days after the meeting has been held before
 17 26 it may adopt an ordinance establishing a district. Property
 17 27 included in the proposed district need not be included in the
 17 28 established district. However, property may not be included in
 17 29 the district that was not included in the petition proposing
 17 30 the district until the council has held another meeting for
 17 31 hearing.
 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance
 18  1 has been filed with the city clerk signed by at least 25
 18  2 percent of all owners of property within the proposed district
 18  3 representing ownership of property with an assessed value of 25
 18  4 percent or more of the assessed value of all of the property in
 18  5 the proposed district, the adoption of the ordinance requires a
 18  6 unanimous vote of the council.  Additionally under the bill,
 18  7 at any time prior to adoption of an ordinance establishing a
 18  8 district, the entire matter of establishing such district shall
 18  9 be withdrawn from council consideration if a petition objecting
 18 10 to establishing such district is filed with the city clerk
 18 11 containing the signatures of at least 40 percent of all owners
 18 12 of property within the proposed district or signatures which
 18 13 together represent ownership of property with an assessed value
 18 14 of 40 percent or more of the assessed value of all property
 18 15 within the proposed district.
 18 16    The ordinance establishing the district may provide for
 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the
 18 19 relationship of the property or the interest of property
 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city
 18 23 and property owners to appeal establishment of a district.

 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are
 18 31 similar to those for establishment of the district.  The bill,
 18 32 however, provides for the consolidation of procedural steps
 18 33 for the petitioning and establishment of the district with
 18 34 the procedural steps for the authorization of any improvement
 18 35 or with the procedural steps for the authorization of any
 19  1 tax, or any combination thereof.  The bill also specifies
 19  2 the procedures and requirements for amending the ordinance
 19  3 establishing the district and for dissolution of the district.
 19  4    Contracts for improvements within a district must be entered
 19  5 into in accordance with Code chapter 26.
 19  6    The bill authorizes a city to establish a municipal park
 19  7 improvement district operation fund, and the city may certify
 19  8 taxes not to exceed the rate limitation as established in
 19  9 the ordinance establishing the district for the purpose of
 19 10 paying the administrative expenses of the district. The taxes
 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes
 19 17 not to exceed the rate specified in the ordinance establishing
 19 18 the district for the purpose of accumulating moneys for the
 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the

 17 32    Adoption of the ordinance establishing a district requires
 17 33 the affirmative vote of three=fourths of all of the members of
 17 34 the council, or, in cities having a three=member council, the
 17 35 affirmative vote of two members. However, if a remonstrance

 18 17 the division of all of the property within the district into
 18 18 two or more zones based upon a reasonable difference in the

 18 20 owners. The ordinance may establish a different maximum rate
 18 21 of tax for each zone in the district.
 18 22    The bill specifies the procedures for residents of the city

 18 27 district representing ownership of property with an assessed
 18 28 value of 25 percent or more of the assessed value of all
 18 29 the property in the district. The notice, meeting, and
 18 30 approval requirements for an improvement in the district are

 19 11 levied for this fund may also be used for the purpose of paying
 19 12 maintenance expenses of improvements for a specified length
 19 13 of time, and may be renewed, if such is clearly stated in the
 19 14 petition requesting the improvement.
 19 15    A city may also establish a municipal park improvement
 19 16 capital fund for a district, and the city may certify taxes

 19 19 financing or payment of a part or all of the costs of any
 19 20 improvement.
 19 21    The bill authorizes a city to issue and sell municipal
 19 22 park improvement district bonds.  The proceeds of the sale
 19 23 of the bonds may be used to pay any or all of the costs of
 19 24 an improvement or may be used to pay any legal indebtedness
 19 25 incurred for the cost of an improvement, including bonds or
 19 26 warrants previously issued to pay the costs of an improvement,
 19 27 or the bonds may be exchanged for the evidences of such legal
 19 28 indebtedness.
 19 29    A city shall establish a municipal park improvement district
 19 30 debt service fund whenever any municipal park improvement
 19 31 district bonds are issued and outstanding, other than revenue
 19 32 bonds, and shall certify taxes to be levied against all of
 19 33 the property in the district for the debt service fund in the
 19 34 amount necessary to pay interest as it becomes due.
 19 35    The bill provides that if a residential property owner
 20  1 within the district has annual household income that is less
 20  2 than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, the owner may
 20  3 file a petition with the city clerk for abatement of the taxes
 20  4 imposed under the authority contained in new Code chapter
 20  5 386A.  If the owner satisfies the requirements for abatement,
 20  6 the city council shall order the county treasurer to suspend
 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
 20 13 new petition must be filed by the property owner.  The bill
 20 14 provides for appeal of denial of an abatement petition to the
 20 15 district court of the county in which any part of the city is

 20  7 the collection of all municipal park improvement district
 20  8 taxes imposed on the petitioner's property used as a primary
 20  9 residence for the current year and each of the two years
 20 10 immediately following the current year. An approved abatement
 20 11 of taxes is rescinded when the property is sold or transferred.
 20 12 Following expiration of the three=year abatement period, a
