  2 33    Current law requires the state board of education to adopt
  2 34 rules for online learning, including rules prohibiting the
  2 35 open enrollment of students whose educational instruction and
  3  1 course content are delivered primarily over the internet. An
  3  2 exception to that prohibition requires the board to adopt rules
  3  3 allowing such enrollment, with limitations on how many students
  3  4 may be enrolled statewide and per school district. The
  3  5 exception also limits such open enrollment to the CAM community
  3  6 school district or the Clayton Ridge community school district
  3  7 until June 30, 2015. This exception to the prohibition of open
  3  8 enrollment in online learning is repealed by its own terms July

  3 12 limitation of open enrollment to the CAM community school
  3 13 district or the Clayton Ridge community school district,

  3 15    The bill also provides that the limitations on how many
  3 16 students may be enrolled statewide or per district shall not
  3 17 apply if the limitations would prevent siblings from enrolling
  3 18 in the same school district or if a sending district determines
  3 19 that the educational needs of a physically or emotionally
  3 20 fragile student would be best served by educational instruction
  3 21 and course content that are delivered primarily over the
  3 22 internet.
  3 23    The bill provides requirements for school districts
  3 24 providing educational instruction and course content that are
  3 25 delivered primarily over the internet, including monitoring
  3 26 and verifying student enrollment and student progress and
  3 27 performance, conducting parent=teacher conferences, and
  3 28 administering state=required assessments.
  3 29    The bill strikes a requirement that the department of
  3 30 education conduct a survey of students who participate in open
