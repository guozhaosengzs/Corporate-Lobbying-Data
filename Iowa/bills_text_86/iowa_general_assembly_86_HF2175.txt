  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    BIOFUELS TAX CREDIT AND REFUND EXTENSIONS.  This bill
  5 15 extends the expiration date of four biofuel tax programs from
  5 16 January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2025, including three income tax
  5 17 credits and one sales and use tax refund.
  5 18    BIODIESEL FUEL TAX CREDIT == INCREASED TAX CREDIT RATE FOR
  5 19 B=11 OR HIGHER.  The bill increases the designated tax credit
  5 20 rate for the sale of biodiesel blended fuel classified as
  5 21 B=11 or higher from 4.5 to 7 cents per gallon, retroactively
  5 22 applicable to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
  5 23    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  5 24 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  5 25 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  5 26 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  5 27 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  5 28 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  5 29 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  5 30 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  5 31 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  5 32    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  5 33 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  5 34 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  5 35 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6  1 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6  2 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6  3 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6  4 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6  5 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6  6 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6  7 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6  8 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6  9 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 10    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 11 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 12 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 13 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 14 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 15 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 16 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 17 facility.
  6 18    FUTURE REPEAL OF REFERENCES TO THE ETHANOL PROMOTION TAX
  6 19 CREDIT.  The bill amends Code sections creating the E=85
  6 20 gasoline promotion tax credit and the E=15 plus gasoline
  6 21 promotion tax credit by repealing references to another tax
  6 22 credit referred to as the ethanol promotion tax credit claimed
  6 23 by a retail dealer who attains a certain threshold number of
  6 24 all biofuels sold during a determination period and which is
  6 25 based on the number of gallons of pure ethanol sold during that
  6 26 period.  The amendments become effective on January 1, 2021,
  6 27 which is the date that the ethanol promotion tax credit is due
  6 28 to expire.

  5 19 B=11 OR HIGHER.  The bill increases the designated tax credit
  5 20 rate for the sale of biodiesel blended fuel classified as
  5 21 B=11 or higher from 4.5 to 7 cents per gallon, retroactively
  5 22 applicable to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
  5 23    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  5 24 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  5 25 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  5 26 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  5 27 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  5 28 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  5 29 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  5 30 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  5 31 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  5 32    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  5 33 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  5 34 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  5 35 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6  1 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6  2 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6  3 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6  4 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6  5 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6  6 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6  7 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6  8 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6  9 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 10    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 11 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 12 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 13 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 14 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 15 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 16 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 17 facility.
  6 18    FUTURE REPEAL OF REFERENCES TO THE ETHANOL PROMOTION TAX
  6 19 CREDIT.  The bill amends Code sections creating the E=85
  6 20 gasoline promotion tax credit and the E=15 plus gasoline
  6 21 promotion tax credit by repealing references to another tax
  6 22 credit referred to as the ethanol promotion tax credit claimed
  6 23 by a retail dealer who attains a certain threshold number of
  6 24 all biofuels sold during a determination period and which is
  6 25 based on the number of gallons of pure ethanol sold during that
  6 26 period.  The amendments become effective on January 1, 2021,
  6 27 which is the date that the ethanol promotion tax credit is due
  6 28 to expire.

  5 16 January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2025, including three income tax
  5 17 credits and one sales and use tax refund.
  5 18    BIODIESEL FUEL TAX CREDIT == INCREASED TAX CREDIT RATE FOR
  5 19 B=11 OR HIGHER.  The bill increases the designated tax credit
  5 20 rate for the sale of biodiesel blended fuel classified as
  5 21 B=11 or higher from 4.5 to 7 cents per gallon, retroactively
  5 22 applicable to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
  5 23    BACKGROUND.  A biofuel is a substance blended with motor fuel
  5 24 (gasoline or diesel fuel) and includes either ethanol (ethyl
  5 25 alcohol) or biodiesel (a substance derived from vegetable
  5 26 oils or animal fats) meeting state standards (Code section
  5 27 214A.2).  A motor fuel blended with a biofuel is referred to
  5 28 as a renewable fuel.  The amount of the tax credit or refund
  5 29 is claimed by a taxpayer on a tax or calendar year basis after
  5 30 multiplying the total gallonage of a qualifying renewable fuel
  5 31 or biofuel times a designated monetary rate.
  5 32    CURRENT INCOME TAX CREDITS.  The income tax credits may
  5 33 be claimed by a retail dealer operating a retail motor fuel
  5 34 site and the amount of each tax credit is based on the total
  5 35 number of gallons of a renewable fuel sold.  The E=15 plus
  6  1 gasoline promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of
  6  2 between 15 and 69 percent per gallon and the designated rate
  6  3 equals 3 cents except between June 1 and September 15 when
  6  4 the designated rate increases to 10 cents.  The E=85 gasoline
  6  5 promotion tax credit requires an ethanol content of between
  6  6 70 and 85 percent per gallon and the designated rate equals
  6  7 16 cents.  The biodiesel blended fuel tax credit requires a
  6  8 biodiesel content of at least 5 percent per gallon (B=5) and
  6  9 the designated rate equals 4.5 cents.
  6 10    SALES AND USE TAX REFUND.  The sales and use tax refund may
  6 11 be claimed by a biodiesel producer who manufactures biodiesel
  6 12 for use in biodiesel blended fuel.  The amount of the refund
  6 13 equals the total number of gallons of biodiesel produced during
  6 14 each calendar year quarter multiplied by a designated rate
  6 15 of 2 cents. However, a producer cannot claim the refund on
  6 16 more than 25 million gallons produced at any one manufacturing
  6 17 facility.
  6 18    FUTURE REPEAL OF REFERENCES TO THE ETHANOL PROMOTION TAX
  6 19 CREDIT.  The bill amends Code sections creating the E=85
  6 20 gasoline promotion tax credit and the E=15 plus gasoline
  6 21 promotion tax credit by repealing references to another tax
  6 22 credit referred to as the ethanol promotion tax credit claimed
  6 23 by a retail dealer who attains a certain threshold number of
  6 24 all biofuels sold during a determination period and which is
  6 25 based on the number of gallons of pure ethanol sold during that
  6 26 period.  The amendments become effective on January 1, 2021,
  6 27 which is the date that the ethanol promotion tax credit is due
  6 28 to expire.
