  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 25    This bill relates to firearm violence protective orders and
  5 26 makes penalties applicable.
  5 27    The bill establishes three categories of firearm violence
  5 28 protective orders: (1) a temporary emergency firearm violence
  5 29 protective order (available outside of regular court hours),
  5 30 (2) an ex parte firearm violence protective order, and (3)
  5 31 a firearm violence protective order issued after notice and
  5 32 hearing.
  5 33    TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FIREARM VIOLENCE PROTECTIVE ORDER.
  5 34  The bill provides that a law enforcement officer may seek
  5 35 a temporary emergency firearm protective order by orally
  6  1 contacting a judicial officer.  A court may issue a temporary
  6  2 emergency firearm protective order if a judicial officer
  6  3 finds there is reasonable cause to believe that a person
  6  4 poses an immediate and present danger of physical injury to
  6  5 the respondent's self or others by possessing, shipping,
  6  6 transporting, or receiving firearms, offensive weapons, or
  6  7 ammunition and that a temporary emergency firearm violence
  6  8 protective order is necessary to prevent physical injury to
  6  9 the respondent's self or others because less restrictive
  6 10 alternatives have been tried and found to be ineffective or
  6 11 are determined to be inadequate or inappropriate for the
  6 12 respondent's circumstances.  A temporary emergency firearm
  6 13 violence protective order issued under the bill shall prohibit
  6 14 the respondent from possessing, shipping, transporting,
  6 15 or receiving firearms, offensive weapons, or ammunition or
  6 16 attempting to possess, ship, transport, or receive a firearm,
  6 17 offensive weapon, or ammunition, and expires 21 days from the

  6 22 firearm violence protective order enjoining the respondent
  6 23 from possessing, shipping, transporting, or receiving
  6 24 firearms, offensive weapons, or ammunition. A court shall
  6 25 issue an ex parte firearm violence protective order if the
  6 26 petition, supported by an affidavit made in writing and any
  6 27 additional information and signed by the petitioner under
  6 28 oath, shows a substantial likelihood that the respondent poses

  6 30 to the respondent's self or others by possessing, shipping,
  6 31 transporting, or receiving firearms, offensive weapons, or
  6 32 ammunition as determined by certain evidence including threats
  6 33 of or acts of violence by the respondent, and that the order is
  6 34 necessary to prevent physical injury to the respondent's self
  6 35 or others because less restrictive alternatives have been tried
  7  1 and found to be ineffective, or are determined to be inadequate
  7  2 or inappropriate for the circumstances of the respondent.
  7  3 If the court issues an ex parte firearm violence protective
  7  4 order that prohibits the respondent from possessing, shipping,
  7  5 transporting, or receiving firearms, offensive weapons, or
  7  6 ammunition, the order expires not later than 21 days from the

  7 11    FIREARM PROTECTIVE ORDER == NOTICE AND HEARING.  Subsequent

  7  3 If the court issues an ex parte firearm violence protective
  7  4 order that prohibits the respondent from possessing, shipping,

  7  4 order that prohibits the respondent from possessing, shipping,
  7  5 transporting, or receiving firearms, offensive weapons, or
  7  6 ammunition, the order expires not later than 21 days from the
