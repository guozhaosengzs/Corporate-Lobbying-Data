  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill makes changes relating to the requirement that
  5 22 the department of administrative services (DAS) establish a
  5 23 preference for the purchase of industrial lubricants by state
  5 24 agencies and community colleges.
  5 25    Current Code section 8A.316 requires DAS to develop
  5 26 procedures for purchasing lubricating oil without excluding
  5 27 recycled oils in such products and to require purchases
  5 28 of lubricating oil made from the greatest percentage of
  5 29 recycled oil, unless the product is unavailable, does not
  5 30 meet performance requirements, or is available only at a cost
  5 31 greater than 105 percent of the cost of nonrecycled products.
  5 32 Current Code section 8A.316 also requires DAS to establish a
  5 33 preference for purchasing hydraulic fluids, greases, and other
  5 34 industrial lubricants made from soybeans.
  5 35    The bill removes all references to the terms "lubricating
  6  1 oil and industrial oil" and "hydraulic fluids, greases, and
  6  2 other industrial lubricants" and uniformly applies the term
  6  3 "industrial lubricants", which the bill defines as industrial
  6  4 oil, automotive engine oil, and any other lubricating oil used
  6  5 or applied to machinery. The bill makes conforming amendments
  6  6 relating to this terminology change.
  6  7    The bill requires DAS to develop procedures for purchasing
  6  8 industrial lubricants without the exclusion of recycled oils
  6  9 and products composed of biobased materials, as defined in the
  6 10 bill, and to require purchases of industrial lubricants that
  6 11 contain the greatest percentage of recycled oil or biobased
  6 12 materials. The bill modifies the exception for purchasing
  6 13 products that are only available at a cost greater than 105
  6 14 percent of the cost of comparable products to provide that
  6 15 the comparison is on a life cycle cost basis, as described in
  6 16 the bill. The bill also modifies the requirement that DAS
  6 17 establish and maintain a procurement program for procuring
  6 18 industrial lubricants containing the maximum content of
  6 19 recycled oil or biobased materials in biobased products, with
  6 20 additional preference given to biobased products derived from
  6 21 soybeans, rather than the current law requirement that they
