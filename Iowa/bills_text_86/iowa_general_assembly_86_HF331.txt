  2 28    This bill relates to notice to persons that entry in or
  2 29 on real estate is trespassing and provides an applicability
  2 30 provision.
  2 31    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 32 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 33 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate the
  2 34 property.
  2 35    The bill provides that a person has received notice to

  3  4 by a valid court order under Code chapter 236 (domestic abuse);
  3  5 if a printed or written notice forbidding such entry has been
  3  6 conspicuously posted or exhibited at the main entrance to
  3  7 the property or the forbidden part of the property; or if
  3  8 identifying purple marks or caps have been placed on trees

  3 12 the purple marks or caps.
  3 13    The bill provides that placing purple marks or caps on trees
  3 14 or posts does not constitute notice until January 1, 2017.
  3 15 Entering a property so marked or capped after that date could
  3 16 result in a criminal trespass charge.
  3 17    The bill does not authorize an owner, lessee, or other person
  3 18 in lawful possession of any property to place any purple marks
  3 19 or caps on any tree or post or to install any post or fence if
  3 20 doing so would violate any applicable law, rule, ordinance,
  3 21 order, covenant, bylaw, declaration, regulation, restriction,
  3 22 or instrument.
  3 23    The bill directs the departments of agriculture and land
  3 24 stewardship and natural resources to inform the general public
  3 25 of the purple marking requirements, including information
  3 26 regarding the size requirements of the markings as well as the
