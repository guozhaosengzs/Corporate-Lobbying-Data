  3  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    This bill modifies provisions applicable to the
  3  7 construction, erection, maintenance, or operation of electric
  3  8 transmission lines contained in Code chapter 478.
  3  9    In determining whether to grant a petition for a franchise to
  3 10 construct, erect, maintain, or operate an electric transmission
  3 11 line, the Iowa utilities board is required to find that, among
  3 12 other requirements, the proposed line or lines are necessary
  3 13 to serve a public use and represents a reasonable relationship
  3 14 to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public
  3 15 interest. The bill provides that a finding of public use and
  3 16 public interest shall not be made in the event a petition for
  3 17 a franchise primarily involves construction of a high=voltage
  3 18 direct current line and the petition does not provide for the
  3 19 erection of electric substations at intervals of less than 50
  3 20 miles, which is necessary to accommodate both the purchase and
  3 21 sale to persons located in Iowa of electricity generated or
  3 22 transmitted by the franchisee.
  3 23    Additionally, current Code section 478.3, specifying
  3 24 franchise petition requirements, provides that for the
  3 25 purposes of that Code section, the term "public" shall not be
  3 26 interpreted to be limited to consumers located in Iowa.  The
  3 27 bill modifies this provision to instead specify that the term
  3 28 "public" as used in Code chapter 478 in reference to public
  3 29 use, interest, and needs shall refer to and be limited to
  3 30 consumers located in this state.
  3 31    With reference to both the restriction against a finding
  3 32 of public use and public interest for the high=voltage
  3 33 direct current line and the limitation of the term "public"
  3 34 to consumers located in Iowa, the bill provides that these
  3 35 provisions shall not apply to a transmission line, wire, or
  4  1 cable that is capable of operating at an electric voltage
  4  2 of 34 and one=half kilovolts or greater that primarily
  4  3 provides electricity through alternating current and is
  4  4 used by rate=regulated electric utilities, municipal
  4  5 electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, or electric
  4  6 transmission owners to provide electric service to the
  4  7 aforementioned utilities or to the public for compensation.
  4  8    Further, the bill contains a severability provision
  4  9 providing that if any provision of Code chapter 478 or its
  4 10 application to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
  4 11 otherwise rendered ineffective by any entity, the invalidity

  3  3                           EXPLANATION
  3  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    This bill modifies provisions applicable to the
  3  7 construction, erection, maintenance, or operation of electric
  3  8 transmission lines contained in Code chapter 478.
  3  9    In determining whether to grant a petition for a franchise to
  3 10 construct, erect, maintain, or operate an electric transmission
  3 11 line, the Iowa utilities board is required to find that, among
  3 12 other requirements, the proposed line or lines are necessary
  3 13 to serve a public use and represents a reasonable relationship
  3 14 to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public
  3 15 interest. The bill provides that a finding of public use and
  3 16 public interest shall not be made in the event a petition for
  3 17 a franchise primarily involves construction of a high=voltage
  3 18 direct current line and the petition does not provide for the
  3 19 erection of electric substations at intervals of less than 50
  3 20 miles, which is necessary to accommodate both the purchase and
  3 21 sale to persons located in Iowa of electricity generated or
  3 22 transmitted by the franchisee.
  3 23    Additionally, current Code section 478.3, specifying
  3 24 franchise petition requirements, provides that for the
  3 25 purposes of that Code section, the term "public" shall not be
  3 26 interpreted to be limited to consumers located in Iowa.  The
  3 27 bill modifies this provision to instead specify that the term
  3 28 "public" as used in Code chapter 478 in reference to public
  3 29 use, interest, and needs shall refer to and be limited to
  3 30 consumers located in this state.
  3 31    With reference to both the restriction against a finding
  3 32 of public use and public interest for the high=voltage
  3 33 direct current line and the limitation of the term "public"
  3 34 to consumers located in Iowa, the bill provides that these
  3 35 provisions shall not apply to a transmission line, wire, or
  4  1 cable that is capable of operating at an electric voltage
  4  2 of 34 and one=half kilovolts or greater that primarily
  4  3 provides electricity through alternating current and is
  4  4 used by rate=regulated electric utilities, municipal
  4  5 electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, or electric
  4  6 transmission owners to provide electric service to the
  4  7 aforementioned utilities or to the public for compensation.
  4  8    Further, the bill contains a severability provision
  4  9 providing that if any provision of Code chapter 478 or its
  4 10 application to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
  4 11 otherwise rendered ineffective by any entity, the invalidity
  4 12 or ineffectiveness shall not affect other provisions or
  4 13 applications of the Code chapter that can be given effect
  4 14 without the invalid or ineffective provision or application,
  4 15 and to this end the provisions of the Code chapter are
  4 16 severable.
  4 17    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to
  4 18 petitions for franchise filed on or after November 1, 2014,
  4 19 which have not been acted upon by the board on the bill's

  3  9    In determining whether to grant a petition for a franchise to
  3 10 construct, erect, maintain, or operate an electric transmission
  3 11 line, the Iowa utilities board is required to find that, among
  3 12 other requirements, the proposed line or lines are necessary
  3 13 to serve a public use and represents a reasonable relationship
  3 14 to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public
  3 15 interest. The bill provides that a finding of public use and
  3 16 public interest shall not be made in the event a petition for
  3 17 a franchise primarily involves construction of a high=voltage
  3 18 direct current line and the petition does not provide for the

  3 23    Additionally, current Code section 478.3, specifying
  3 24 franchise petition requirements, provides that for the

  3 32 of public use and public interest for the high=voltage
  3 33 direct current line and the limitation of the term "public"
  3 34 to consumers located in Iowa, the bill provides that these
  3 35 provisions shall not apply to a transmission line, wire, or
  4  1 cable that is capable of operating at an electric voltage
  4  2 of 34 and one=half kilovolts or greater that primarily

  4  5 electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, or electric
  4  6 transmission owners to provide electric service to the
  4  7 aforementioned utilities or to the public for compensation.
  4  8    Further, the bill contains a severability provision
  4  9 providing that if any provision of Code chapter 478 or its
  4 10 application to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
  4 11 otherwise rendered ineffective by any entity, the invalidity
  4 12 or ineffectiveness shall not affect other provisions or
  4 13 applications of the Code chapter that can be given effect

  3  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    This bill modifies provisions applicable to the
  3  7 construction, erection, maintenance, or operation of electric
  3  8 transmission lines contained in Code chapter 478.
  3  9    In determining whether to grant a petition for a franchise to
  3 10 construct, erect, maintain, or operate an electric transmission
  3 11 line, the Iowa utilities board is required to find that, among
  3 12 other requirements, the proposed line or lines are necessary
  3 13 to serve a public use and represents a reasonable relationship
  3 14 to an overall plan of transmitting electricity in the public
  3 15 interest. The bill provides that a finding of public use and
  3 16 public interest shall not be made in the event a petition for
  3 17 a franchise primarily involves construction of a high=voltage
  3 18 direct current line and the petition does not provide for the
  3 19 erection of electric substations at intervals of less than 50
  3 20 miles, which is necessary to accommodate both the purchase and
  3 21 sale to persons located in Iowa of electricity generated or
  3 22 transmitted by the franchisee.
  3 23    Additionally, current Code section 478.3, specifying
  3 24 franchise petition requirements, provides that for the
  3 25 purposes of that Code section, the term "public" shall not be
  3 26 interpreted to be limited to consumers located in Iowa.  The
  3 27 bill modifies this provision to instead specify that the term
  3 28 "public" as used in Code chapter 478 in reference to public
  3 29 use, interest, and needs shall refer to and be limited to
  3 30 consumers located in this state.
  3 31    With reference to both the restriction against a finding
  3 32 of public use and public interest for the high=voltage
  3 33 direct current line and the limitation of the term "public"
  3 34 to consumers located in Iowa, the bill provides that these
  3 35 provisions shall not apply to a transmission line, wire, or
  4  1 cable that is capable of operating at an electric voltage
  4  2 of 34 and one=half kilovolts or greater that primarily
  4  3 provides electricity through alternating current and is
  4  4 used by rate=regulated electric utilities, municipal
  4  5 electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, or electric
  4  6 transmission owners to provide electric service to the
  4  7 aforementioned utilities or to the public for compensation.
  4  8    Further, the bill contains a severability provision
  4  9 providing that if any provision of Code chapter 478 or its
  4 10 application to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
  4 11 otherwise rendered ineffective by any entity, the invalidity
  4 12 or ineffectiveness shall not affect other provisions or
  4 13 applications of the Code chapter that can be given effect
  4 14 without the invalid or ineffective provision or application,
