  1  7 ensure its continuing development and growth in the national
  1  8 and global competitive marketplace by providing for early
  1  9 completion of the construction of the most important portions
  1 10 of the Iowa highway system.  These portions of the system

  1 22 commission shall give priority consideration to the
  1 23 establishment of direct linkages between economic centers
