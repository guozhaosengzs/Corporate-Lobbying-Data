  2 29    Sec. 2.    2 29    Sec. 2.    2 30 aliens.
  2 31    1.  Knowingly employing unauthorized aliens prohibited.  An
  2 32 employer shall not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. If
  2 33 an employer uses a contract, subcontract, or other independent
  2 34 contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in
  2 35 this state, and the employer knowingly contracts with an
  3  1 unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts
  3  2 with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer
  3  3 violates this subsection.
  3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the

  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.

  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.

  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.

  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    2 31    1.  Knowingly employing unauthorized aliens prohibited.  An
  2 32 employer shall not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. If
  2 33 an employer uses a contract, subcontract, or other independent
  2 34 contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in
  2 35 this state, and the employer knowingly contracts with an
  3  1 unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts
  3  2 with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer
  3  3 violates this subsection.
  3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    2 32 employer shall not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. If
  2 33 an employer uses a contract, subcontract, or other independent
  2 34 contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in
  2 35 this state, and the employer knowingly contracts with an
  3  1 unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts
  3  2 with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer
  3  3 violates this subsection.
  3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.

  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the

  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by

  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    2 33 an employer uses a contract, subcontract, or other independent
  2 34 contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in
  2 35 this state, and the employer knowingly contracts with an
  3  1 unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts
  3  2 with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer
  3  3 violates this subsection.
  3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.

  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not

  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the

  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county

  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  1 unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts
  3  2 with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer
  3  3 violates this subsection.
  3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by

  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred

  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:

  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse

  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  4    2.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  5 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the

  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien

  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of

  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  6 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  7 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3  8 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  3  9 scheduling a hearing at the earliest practicable date.

  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn

  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.

  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn

  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 10    3.  Court order ==== first violation.  On a finding of a first
  3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 11 violation as described in subsection 5, the court shall require
  3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.

  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.

  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 12 by order all of the following:
  3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 13    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 14 unauthorized aliens.
  3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with

  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.

  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the

  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 15    b.  (1)  The employer shall be subject to a three=year
  3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 16 probationary period for the business location where the
  3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 17 unauthorized alien performed work.
  3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 18    (2)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 19 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 20 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 21 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 22 performed work.
  3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 23    c.  The employer shall be required to file a signed sworn
  3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 24 affidavit with the county attorney within three business days
  3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 25 after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the
  3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 26 employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized
  3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 27 aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly
  3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 28 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  3 29    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  3 30 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county

  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien

  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate

  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph

  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by

  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a

  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 31 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  3 34 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  3 35 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  4  1 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  4  2    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  4 11 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  4 14 secretary of state and the secretary of state shall maintain
  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.

  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    3 32 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  3 33 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement

  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently

  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4  3 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  4  4 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  5 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  4  6 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  4  7 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  4  8 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  4  9 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  4 10 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of

  4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the

  4 15 the copy pursuant to subsection 6.
  4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,

  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,

  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection

  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 12 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  4 13 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the

  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.

  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state

  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.

  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental

  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 16    (3)  The court may order the appropriate agencies to suspend
  4 17 all licenses described in this paragraph "c" that are held by
  4 18 the employer for not more than ten business days. The court
  4 19 shall base its decision to suspend under this subparagraph
  4 20 on any evidence or information submitted to it during the
  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by

  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.

  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.

  4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 21 action for a violation of subsection 1 and shall consider the
  4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 22 following factors, if relevant:
  4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply
  4 28 with any applicable requirements.
  4 29    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  4 30    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  4 31 the employer in the violation.
  4 32    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  4 33    4.  Court order ==== second violation.  For a second violation,
  4 34 as described in subsection 5, the court shall order the
  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by
  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  5 18 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 19 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 20 location.
  5 21    6.  Secretary of state database.  The secretary of state
  5 22 shall maintain copies of court orders that are received
  5 23 pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a
  5 24 database of the employers and business locations found to have
  5 25 committed a first violation of subsection 1 and make the court
  5 26 orders available on the secretary of state's internet site.
  5 27    7.  Federal determination creates rebuttable presumption.  In
  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee
  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,
  6  3 an employer that establishes that it has complied in good
  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not
  6  6 knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
  6  7 considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C.
  6  8 {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic, or accidental
  6  9 technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if
  6 10 there is a good=faith attempt to comply with the requirements.
  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 23    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  4 24 employer.
  4 25    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  4 35 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  5  1 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  5  2 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  5 10    5.  Violations defined.
  5 11    a.  A violation shall be considered a first violation by
  5 12 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  5 13 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  5 14 subsection 3, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's
  5 33 determination that the employee is an unauthorized alien
  5 34 creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's unauthorized
  5 35 status. The employer may present evidence that the employee

  6 11    9.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  6 12    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.

  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement

  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    4 26    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  4 27    (d)  Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply

  5  3 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  5  4 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  5  5 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  5  6 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  5  7 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  5  9 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 27    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    5  8 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,

  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's

  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement

  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse

  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.

  5 28 determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the
  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's

  6  1 is not an unauthorized alien.
  6  2    8.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this section,

  6  4 faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes
  6  5 a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer did not

  6 13 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  6 14 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  6 15 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  6 16 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  6 17 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  6 24    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  6 25 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 26 induced the employer to commit the violation.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.
  6 35    Sec. 3.    5 15 location.
  5 16    b.  A violation shall be considered a second violation by

  5 29 court shall consider the federal government's determination
  5 30 of the immigration status of the employee pursuant to 8
  5 31 U.S.C. {1373(c).  The court may take judicial notice of the
  5 32 federal government's determination. The federal government's

  6 18 evidence:
  6 19    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  6 20 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  6 23 induced the employer to commit the violation.

  6 28 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  6 29 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  6 30 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  6 31 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  6 32 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  6 33 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  6 34 an employer has proven entrapment.

  5 17 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred

  7 35                           EXPLANATION
  8  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  3    This bill prohibits employers from knowingly employing
  8  4 unauthorized aliens.
  8  5    The bill defines "employer" as a person that transacts
  8  6 business in this state, that has a license issued by an agency
  8  7 in this state, and that employs 25 or more full=time employees
  8  8 in this state. "Employer" includes this state, a political
  8  9 subdivision of this state, and a self=employed individual.
  8 10 In the case of an independent contractor, "employer" means
  8 11 the independent contractor and does not mean the person or
  8 12 organization that uses the contract labor.
  8 13    The bill requires the county attorney to bring an action
  8 14 in district court against an employer for a violation in the
  8 15 county where the unauthorized alien employee is or was employed
  8 16 by the employer.  The bill provides that such an action must be
  8 17 expedited by the court.
  8 18    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
  8 19 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
  8 20 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
  8 21 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
  8 22 appropriate agencies.  The court must also order a three=year
  8 23 probationary period for the employer.  The court may also
  8 24 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
  8 25 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
  8 26 considering certain factors.   The bill provides that for a
  8 27 second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
  8 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
  8 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
  8 30 licenses.  The bill directs the secretary of state to maintain
  8 31 an online database of first=time offenders.
  8 32    In determining the immigration status of an alleged
  8 33 unauthorized alien employed by an employer, the bill requires
  8 34 the district court to consider the federal government's
  8 35 determination of the immigration status of the employee. The
  9  1 federal government's determination that the employee is an
  9  2 unauthorized alien creates a rebuttable presumption of the
  9  3 employee's unauthorized status. The employer may present
  9  4 evidence that the employee is not an unauthorized alien.
  9  5 The bill provides that an employer who establishes that
  9  6 the employer complied in good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  9  7 establishes a conclusive affirmative defense that the employer
  9  8 did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill
  9  9 provides that an employer is considered to have complied with
  9 10 the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an
  9 11 isolated, sporadic, or accidental technical or procedural
  9 12 failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good=faith
  9 13 attempt to comply with the requirements.  The bill provides an
  9 14 employer with an affirmative defense of entrapment if certain
  9 15 elements are met.
  9 16    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
  9 17 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
  9 18 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
  9 19 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
  9 20 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
  9 21 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
  9 22 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
  9 23 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
  9 24 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
  9 25 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
  9 26 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
  9 27 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
  9 28 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
  9 29 secretary of state to request from the United States department
  9 30 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
  9 31 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
  9 32 secretary of state to make the list available on the secretary
  9 33 of state's internet site.
  9 34    The bill provides that the bill shall not be construed
  9 35 to require an employer to take any action that the employer
 10  1 believes in good faith would violate federal or state law.
 10  2    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 10  3 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 10  4 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 10  5 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 10  6 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 10  7 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 10  8 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    This chapter shall not be construed to require an employer to
  7 31 take any action that the employer believes in good faith would

  7 34 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  7 35                           EXPLANATION
  8  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  3    This bill prohibits employers from knowingly employing
  8  4 unauthorized aliens.
  8  5    The bill defines "employer" as a person that transacts
  8  6 business in this state, that has a license issued by an agency
  8  7 in this state, and that employs 25 or more full=time employees
  8  8 in this state. "Employer" includes this state, a political
  8  9 subdivision of this state, and a self=employed individual.
  8 10 In the case of an independent contractor, "employer" means
  8 11 the independent contractor and does not mean the person or
  8 12 organization that uses the contract labor.
  8 13    The bill requires the county attorney to bring an action
  8 14 in district court against an employer for a violation in the
  8 15 county where the unauthorized alien employee is or was employed
  8 16 by the employer.  The bill provides that such an action must be
  8 17 expedited by the court.
  8 18    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court

  8 34 the district court to consider the federal government's
  8 35 determination of the immigration status of the employee. The
  9  1 federal government's determination that the employee is an
  9  2 unauthorized alien creates a rebuttable presumption of the
  9  3 employee's unauthorized status. The employer may present
  9  4 evidence that the employee is not an unauthorized alien.
  9  5 The bill provides that an employer who establishes that
  9  6 the employer complied in good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)

  9  8 did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill
  9  9 provides that an employer is considered to have complied with
  9 10 the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an
  9 11 isolated, sporadic, or accidental technical or procedural
  9 12 failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good=faith

  9 19 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
  9 20 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
  9 21 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
  9 22 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
  9 23 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
  9 24 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
  9 25 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
  9 26 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
  9 27 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
  9 28 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
  9 29 secretary of state to request from the United States department
  9 30 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
  9 31 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
  9 32 secretary of state to make the list available on the secretary
