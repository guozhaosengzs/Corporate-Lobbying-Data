  3 12    1.  Knowingly or intentionally employing unauthorized aliens
  3 13 prohibited.  An employer shall not knowingly or intentionally
  3 14 employ an unauthorized alien. If an employer uses a contract,
  3 15 subcontract, or other independent contractor agreement to
  3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 12    1.  Knowingly or intentionally employing unauthorized aliens
  3 13 prohibited.  An employer shall not knowingly or intentionally
  3 14 employ an unauthorized alien. If an employer uses a contract,
  3 15 subcontract, or other independent contractor agreement to
  3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 13 prohibited.  An employer shall not knowingly or intentionally
  3 14 employ an unauthorized alien. If an employer uses a contract,
  3 15 subcontract, or other independent contractor agreement to
  3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 14 employ an unauthorized alien. If an employer uses a contract,
  3 15 subcontract, or other independent contractor agreement to
  3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 15 subcontract, or other independent contractor agreement to
  3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 16 obtain the labor of an alien in this state, and the employer
  3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.

  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the

  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be

  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county

  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that

  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this

  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 17 knowingly or intentionally contracts with an unauthorized
  3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not

  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law

  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 18 alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an
  3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates

  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not

  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 19 unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates
  3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 20 this subsection.
  3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.

  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the

  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.

  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be

  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be

  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien

  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject

  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this

  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses

  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.

  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 21    2.  Complaints.
  3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 22    a.  The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form
  3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 23 for a person to allege a violation of subsection 1. The
  3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 24 complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's
  3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 25 social security number on the complaint form or to have the
  3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the

  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the

  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.

  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with

  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 26 complaint form notarized.  Complaints shall be submitted to the
  3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 27 attorney general or a county attorney.  A complaint that is
  3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including

  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the

  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses

  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 28 submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county
  3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.

  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An

  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other

  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 29 attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien
  3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not

  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged

  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether

  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including

  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall

  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 30 is or was employed by the employer. This subsection shall not
  3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 31 be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints
  3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 32 that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.
  3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 33    b.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form
  3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 34 that an employer allegedly knowingly or intentionally employs
  3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    3 35 or employed an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or
  4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  1 county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has
  4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  2 violated subsection 1. If a complaint is received but is not
  4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  3 submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general
  4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  4 or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has
  4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  5 violated subsection 1.
  4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  6    c.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not
  4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  7 investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color,
  4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  8 or national origin.  The county sheriff or any other local law
  4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien

  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer

  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)

  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for

  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4  9 enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.
  4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 10 When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county
  4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 11 attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged
  4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.

  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply

  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license

  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,

  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 12 unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8
  4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 13 U.S.C. {1373(c). A state, county, or local official shall not
  4 14 attempt to independently make a final determination on whether
  4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until

  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that

  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:

  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable

  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or

  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 15 an alien is authorized to work in the United States.
  4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 16    d.  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous
  4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall

  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 17 complaint under this subsection is guilty of a simple
  4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 18 misdemeanor.
  4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or

  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.

  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require

  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file

  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that

  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:

  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall

  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization

  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not

  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 19    3.  Required notifications.
  4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or

  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to

  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license

  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 20    a.  If, after an investigation, the attorney general or
  4 21 county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and
  4 22 not frivolous, the attorney general or county attorney shall
  4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the

  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 23 notify the following entities of the unauthorized alien:
  4 24    (1)  The United States immigration and customs enforcement.
  4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the

  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 25    (2)  The local law enforcement agency.
  4 26    b.  The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county
  4 27 attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection 4 if the
  4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require

  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.

  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).

  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied

  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 28 complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.
  4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 29    4.  Court action required.  An action for a violation of
  4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.

  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with

  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.

  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject

  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the

  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 30 subsection 1 shall be brought against the employer by the
  4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including

  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.

  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 31 county attorney in the district court of the county where the
  4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.
  4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including
  4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An

  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for

  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 32 unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.

  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 33 The district court shall expedite the action, including

  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 34 assigning a hearing at the earliest practicable date.
  4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    4 35    5.  Court order == first violation.  On a finding of a first
  5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.

  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer

  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the

  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  1 violation as described in subsection 7, the court shall require
  5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  2 by order all of the following:
  5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  3    a.  The employer shall terminate the employment of all
  5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law

  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  4 unauthorized aliens.
  5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  5    b.  (1)  For a knowing violation, the employer shall be
  5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  6 subject to a three=year probationary period for the business
  5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate

  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer

  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.

  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  7 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business

  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  8    (2)  For an intentional violation, the employer shall be
  5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5  9 subject to a five=year probationary period for the business
  5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.

  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 10 location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
  5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 11    (3)  During the probationary period, the employer shall file
  5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 12 quarterly reports on the form prescribed in section 252G.3 with
  5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 13 the county attorney for each new employee who is hired by the
  5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 14 employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 15 performed work.
  5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 16    c.  The employer shall file a signed sworn affidavit with
  5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 17 the county attorney within three business days after the order
  5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 18 is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has
  5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 19 terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this
  5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 20 state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally
  5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 21 employ an unauthorized alien in this state.
  5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 22    (1)  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to
  5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 23 suspend all licenses that are held by the employer if the
  5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 24 employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 25 attorney within three business days after the order is issued.
  5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 26 All licenses that are suspended shall remain suspended until
  5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 27 the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county
  5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 28 attorney. Upon filing of the affidavit, the suspended licenses
  5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 29 shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.
  5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the

  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse

  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if

  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 30    (2)  Licenses that are subject to suspension under this
  5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien

  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:

  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 31 paragraph "c" are all licenses that are held by the employer
  5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    5 32 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 33 performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
  5 34 specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien
  5 35 performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the
  6  1 employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject
  6  2 to suspension under this paragraph "c" are all licenses that
  6  3 are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of
  6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's
  6  6 order. The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the
  6  7 attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the
  6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the
  6 10 appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in this
  6 11 paragraph "c" that are held by the employer for not more than
  6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.

  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.

  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location

  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if

  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of

  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An

  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:

  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the

  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.

  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply

  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of

  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6  4 business. On receipt of the court's order, the appropriate
  6  5 agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's

  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred

  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall

  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by

  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6  8 copy pursuant to subsection 8.
  6  9    (3)  For a knowing violation, the court may order the

  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.

  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under

  7 17 location.

  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may

  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.

  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement

  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.

  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 12 ten business days. For an intentional violation, the court
  6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not

  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 13 shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses
  6 14 described in this paragraph "c" that are held by the employer
  6 15 for a minimum of ten business days. The court shall base its
  6 16 decision to suspend under this subparagraph on any evidence or
  6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:

  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.

  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 17 information submitted to it during the action for a violation
  6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 18 of subsection 1 and shall consider the following factors, if
  6 19 relevant:
  6 20    (a)  The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the
  6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.

  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently

  7 12 location.

  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 21 employer.
  6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 22    (b)  Any prior misconduct by the employer.
  6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 23    (c)  The degree of harm resulting from the violation.
  6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.

  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 24    (d)  Whether the employer made good=faith efforts to comply
  6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of

  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 25 with any applicable requirements.
  6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of

  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 26    (e)  The duration of the violation.
  6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 27    (f)  The role of the directors, officers, or principals of
  6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the

  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 28 the employer in the violation.
  6 29    (g)  Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
  6 30    6.  Court order == second violation.  For a second violation,
  6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that

  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by

  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An

  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 31 as described in subsection 7, the court shall order the
  6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.
  7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 32 appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that
  6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location
  7  1 where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license
  7  2 is necessary to operate the employer's business in general,
  7  3 the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently
  7  4 revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the
  7  5 employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order,
  7  6 the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.
  7  7    7.  Violations defined.

  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    6 33 are held by the employer specific to the business location
  6 34 where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
  6 35 does not hold a license specific to the business location

  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement

  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.

  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may

  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).

  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,

  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    7  8    a.  The violation shall be considered a first violation by
  7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred

  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    7  9 an employer at a business location if the violation did not
  7 10 occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 11 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 12 location.
  7 13    b.  The violation shall be considered a second violation by
  7 14 an employer at a business location if the violation occurred
  7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall

  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,

  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    7 15 during a probationary period ordered by the court under
  7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    7 16 subsection 5, paragraph "b", for that employer's business
  7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to
  7 20 subsection 5, paragraph "c", and shall maintain a database
  7 21 of the employers and business locations that have a first
  7 22 violation of subsection 1 and make the court orders available
  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 33    10.  E=verify rebuttable presumption.  For the purposes of
  7 34 this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization
  7 35 of an employee through the e=verify program creates a
  8  1 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
  8  2 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.
  8  3    11.  Good=faith compliance.  For the purposes of this
  8  4 section, an employer that establishes that it has complied
  8  5 in good faith with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b)
  8  6 establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not
  8  7 knowingly or intentionally employ an unauthorized alien. An
  8  8 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
  8  9 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
  8 10 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
  8 11 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
  8 12 the requirements.
  8 13    12.  Entrapment as affirmative defense.
  8 14    a.  It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection
  8 15 1 that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the
  8 16 employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
  8 17 evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An
  8 18 employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden
  8 19 of proving all of the following by a preponderance of the
  8 20 evidence:
  8 21    (1)  The idea of committing the violation started with law
  8 22 enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the
  8 23 employer.
  8 24    (2)  The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 25 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 26    (3)  The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation
  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and
  8 28 induced the employer to commit the violation.
  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement
  8 31 officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
  8 32 opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for
  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.
  9  2    Sec. 4.    7 17 location.
  7 18    8.  Attorney general database.  The attorney general shall
  7 19 maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to

  7 23 on the attorney general's internet site.
  7 24    9.  Federal determination governs.  In determining whether
  7 25 an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider
  7 26 only the federal government's determination contained in
  7 27 its response to an inquiry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).
  7 28 The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable
  7 29 presumption of the employee's lawful status. The court may
  7 30 take judicial notice of the federal government's determination
  7 31 and may request the federal government to provide automated or
  7 32 testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. {1373(c).

  8 27 before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and

  8 29    b.  An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer
  8 30 was predisposed to violate subsection 1 and the law enforcement

  8 33 law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse
  8 34 or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement
  8 35 officers and their agents may be considered in determining if
  9  1 an employer has proven entrapment.

 14  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14  2    This bill relates to unlawful aliens and law enforcement in
 14  3 Iowa.
 14  4    UNLAWFUL ALIEN IMMIGRATION FUND.  The bill creates an
 14  5 unlawful alien enforcement fund in the state treasury under
 14  6 the control of the department of public safety, subject to
 14  7 appropriation by the general assembly.  The bill provides
 14  8 that the fund will consist of certain penalties, as well as
 14  9 moneys appropriated by the general assembly.  The bill requires
 14 10 the moneys in the fund to be used for enforcement of laws
 14 11 relating to unlawful aliens and for incarceration costs for
 14 12 unlawful aliens.  Interest or earnings on moneys credited
 14 13 to the unlawful alien enforcement fund will be credited to
 14 14 the unlawful alien enforcement fund. Moneys credited to the
 14 15 unlawful alien enforcement fund at the end of a fiscal year
 14 16 will not revert to any other fund but will remain in the
 14 17 unlawful alien enforcement fund.
 14 18    EMPLOYMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 14 19 provides definitions relating to employment of unauthorized
 14 20 aliens.  The bill prohibits employers that transact business
 14 21 in Iowa and that have a business license issued by an agency
 14 22 in Iowa from knowingly or intentionally employing unauthorized
 14 23 aliens.  The bill directs the attorney general to prescribe a
 14 24 complaint form for alleged violations of the prohibition.  The
 14 25 bill provides that complaints may be submitted to the attorney
 14 26 general or the county attorney in the county in which the
 14 27 alleged unauthorized alien is or was employed by the employer.
 14 28 The bill directs the attorney general or county attorney to
 14 29 investigate complaints, and to verify the work authorization
 14 30 of an alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government.
 14 31 The bill prohibits the attorney general or county attorney
 14 32 from investigating complaints that are based solely on race,
 14 33 color, or national origin.  The bill allows a county sheriff
 14 34 or other local law enforcement to assist in an investigation.
 14 35 The bill provides that a person who knowingly files a false and
 15  1 frivolous complaint is guilty of a simple misdemeanor, which is
 15  2 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 15  3 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 15  4    The bill requires the attorney general or county attorney
 15  5 to notify United States immigration and customs enforcement,
 15  6 the local law enforcement agency, and, if the attorney general
 15  7 is the one investigating, the county attorney, of a complaint
 15  8 that is not false and not frivolous.  The bill requires the
 15  9 county attorney to bring an action in district court against an
 15 10 employer for a violation in the county where the unauthorized
 15 11 alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The bill
 15 12 provides that such an action must be expedited by the court.
 15 13    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
 15 14 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
 15 15 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also
 15 21 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is
 17  8 concealing, harboring, or shielding or attempting to conceal,
 17  9 harbor, or shield from detection an alien in the vehicle if
 17 10 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17 11 alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States
 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the
 17 18 full extent permitted by federal law.  The bill requires law
 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
 18 19 823 is to be implemented consistent with federal immigration
 18 20 law protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting
 18 21 the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.
 18 22    IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  The bill provides that the bill
 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all
 18 25 persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United
 18 26 States citizens.
 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 14 29 investigate complaints, and to verify the work authorization
 14 30 of an alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government.
 14 31 The bill prohibits the attorney general or county attorney
 14 32 from investigating complaints that are based solely on race,
 14 33 color, or national origin.  The bill allows a county sheriff
 14 34 or other local law enforcement to assist in an investigation.
 14 35 The bill provides that a person who knowingly files a false and
 15  1 frivolous complaint is guilty of a simple misdemeanor, which is
 15  2 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 15  3 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 15  4    The bill requires the attorney general or county attorney
 15  5 to notify United States immigration and customs enforcement,
 15  6 the local law enforcement agency, and, if the attorney general
 15  7 is the one investigating, the county attorney, of a complaint
 15  8 that is not false and not frivolous.  The bill requires the
 15  9 county attorney to bring an action in district court against an
 15 10 employer for a violation in the county where the unauthorized
 15 11 alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The bill
 15 12 provides that such an action must be expedited by the court.
 15 13    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
 15 14 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
 15 15 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also
 15 21 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is
 17  8 concealing, harboring, or shielding or attempting to conceal,
 17  9 harbor, or shield from detection an alien in the vehicle if
 17 10 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17 11 alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States
 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the
 17 18 full extent permitted by federal law.  The bill requires law
 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
 18 19 823 is to be implemented consistent with federal immigration
 18 20 law protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting
 18 21 the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.
 18 22    IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  The bill provides that the bill
 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all
 18 25 persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United
 18 26 States citizens.
 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is
 17  8 concealing, harboring, or shielding or attempting to conceal,
 17  9 harbor, or shield from detection an alien in the vehicle if
 17 10 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17 11 alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States
 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the
 17 18 full extent permitted by federal law.  The bill requires law
 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
 18 19 823 is to be implemented consistent with federal immigration
 18 20 law protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting
 18 21 the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.
 18 22    IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  The bill provides that the bill
 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all
 18 25 persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United
 18 26 States citizens.
 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 14  3 Iowa.
 14  4    UNLAWFUL ALIEN IMMIGRATION FUND.  The bill creates an
 14  5 unlawful alien enforcement fund in the state treasury under
 14  6 the control of the department of public safety, subject to
 14  7 appropriation by the general assembly.  The bill provides
 14  8 that the fund will consist of certain penalties, as well as
 14  9 moneys appropriated by the general assembly.  The bill requires
 14 10 the moneys in the fund to be used for enforcement of laws
 14 11 relating to unlawful aliens and for incarceration costs for
 14 12 unlawful aliens.  Interest or earnings on moneys credited
 14 13 to the unlawful alien enforcement fund will be credited to
 14 14 the unlawful alien enforcement fund. Moneys credited to the
 14 15 unlawful alien enforcement fund at the end of a fiscal year
 14 16 will not revert to any other fund but will remain in the
 14 17 unlawful alien enforcement fund.
 14 18    EMPLOYMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 14 19 provides definitions relating to employment of unauthorized
 14 20 aliens.  The bill prohibits employers that transact business
 14 21 in Iowa and that have a business license issued by an agency
 14 22 in Iowa from knowingly or intentionally employing unauthorized
 14 23 aliens.  The bill directs the attorney general to prescribe a
 14 24 complaint form for alleged violations of the prohibition.  The
 14 25 bill provides that complaints may be submitted to the attorney
 14 26 general or the county attorney in the county in which the
 14 27 alleged unauthorized alien is or was employed by the employer.
 14 28 The bill directs the attorney general or county attorney to
 14 29 investigate complaints, and to verify the work authorization
 14 30 of an alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government.
 14 31 The bill prohibits the attorney general or county attorney
 14 32 from investigating complaints that are based solely on race,
 14 33 color, or national origin.  The bill allows a county sheriff
 14 34 or other local law enforcement to assist in an investigation.
 14 35 The bill provides that a person who knowingly files a false and
 15  1 frivolous complaint is guilty of a simple misdemeanor, which is
 15  2 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 15  3 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 15  4    The bill requires the attorney general or county attorney
 15  5 to notify United States immigration and customs enforcement,
 15  6 the local law enforcement agency, and, if the attorney general
 15  7 is the one investigating, the county attorney, of a complaint
 15  8 that is not false and not frivolous.  The bill requires the
 15  9 county attorney to bring an action in district court against an
 15 10 employer for a violation in the county where the unauthorized
 15 11 alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The bill
 15 12 provides that such an action must be expedited by the court.
 15 13    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
 15 14 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
 15 15 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also
 15 21 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is
 17  8 concealing, harboring, or shielding or attempting to conceal,
 17  9 harbor, or shield from detection an alien in the vehicle if
 17 10 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17 11 alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States
 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the
 17 18 full extent permitted by federal law.  The bill requires law
 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter

 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all

 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 14 25 bill provides that complaints may be submitted to the attorney
 14 26 general or the county attorney in the county in which the

 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also

 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally

 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the

 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely

 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its

 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.

 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also

 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for

 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in

 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to

 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney

 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if

 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is

 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation

 15  4    The bill requires the attorney general or county attorney
 15  5 to notify United States immigration and customs enforcement,
 15  6 the local law enforcement agency, and, if the attorney general
 15  7 is the one investigating, the county attorney, of a complaint
 15  8 that is not false and not frivolous.  The bill requires the
 15  9 county attorney to bring an action in district court against an
 15 10 employer for a violation in the county where the unauthorized
 15 11 alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The bill
 15 12 provides that such an action must be expedited by the court.
 15 13    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
 15 14 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
 15 15 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also
 15 21 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is
 17  8 concealing, harboring, or shielding or attempting to conceal,
 17  9 harbor, or shield from detection an alien in the vehicle if
 17 10 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17 11 alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States
 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the
 17 18 full extent permitted by federal law.  The bill requires law
 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
 18 19 823 is to be implemented consistent with federal immigration
 18 20 law protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting
 18 21 the privileges and immunities of United States citizens.
 18 22    IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  The bill provides that the bill
 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all
 18 25 persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United
 18 26 States citizens.
 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an

 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain

 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge

 17 12 illegally.  The bill provides definitions.
 17 13    ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.  The bill creates new Code
 17 14 chapter 823, relating to enforcement of immigration laws.
 17 15 The bill prohibits officials and agencies of this state or
 17 16 its political subdivisions from restricting or limiting the
 17 17 enforcement of the federal immigration laws to less than the

 17 19 enforcement officials and law enforcement agencies of this
 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to
 17 21 determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
 17 22 lawful contact where reasonable suspicion exists regarding the
 17 23 immigration status of the person, except if the determination
 17 24 may hinder or obstruct an investigation.  The bill stipulates
 17 25 that a law enforcement official or agency cannot solely
 17 26 consider race, color, or national origin when implementing
 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be
 17 35 immediately notified.  The bill authorizes a law enforcement
 18  1 agency to securely transport an unlawfully present alien to
 18  2 a federal facility.  The bill prohibits, except as provided
 18  3 in federal law, officials and agencies of this state and its
 18  4 political subdivisions from being prevented or restricted from
 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
 18 19 823 is to be implemented consistent with federal immigration
 18 20 law protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting

 18 23 must be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws
 18 24 regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all

 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

 14 18    EMPLOYMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 14 19 provides definitions relating to employment of unauthorized
 14 20 aliens.  The bill prohibits employers that transact business
 14 21 in Iowa and that have a business license issued by an agency
 14 22 in Iowa from knowingly or intentionally employing unauthorized
 14 23 aliens.  The bill directs the attorney general to prescribe a
 14 24 complaint form for alleged violations of the prohibition.  The
 14 25 bill provides that complaints may be submitted to the attorney
 14 26 general or the county attorney in the county in which the
 14 27 alleged unauthorized alien is or was employed by the employer.
 14 28 The bill directs the attorney general or county attorney to
 14 29 investigate complaints, and to verify the work authorization
 14 30 of an alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government.
 14 31 The bill prohibits the attorney general or county attorney
 14 32 from investigating complaints that are based solely on race,
 14 33 color, or national origin.  The bill allows a county sheriff
 14 34 or other local law enforcement to assist in an investigation.
 14 35 The bill provides that a person who knowingly files a false and
 15  1 frivolous complaint is guilty of a simple misdemeanor, which is
 15  2 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 15  3 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 15  4    The bill requires the attorney general or county attorney
 15  5 to notify United States immigration and customs enforcement,
 15  6 the local law enforcement agency, and, if the attorney general
 15  7 is the one investigating, the county attorney, of a complaint
 15  8 that is not false and not frivolous.  The bill requires the
 15  9 county attorney to bring an action in district court against an
 15 10 employer for a violation in the county where the unauthorized
 15 11 alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The bill
 15 12 provides that such an action must be expedited by the court.
 15 13    The bill provides that for a first violation, the court
 15 14 must order the employer to terminate the employment of all
 15 15 unauthorized aliens and to submit a signed sworn affidavit
 15 16 to that effect or face suspension of business licenses by
 15 17 appropriate agencies.  The court will also order a three=year
 15 18 probationary period for a knowing violation or a five=year
 15 19 probationary period for an intentional violation by an
 15 20 employer.  For a knowing violation, the court may also
 15 21 order the suspension of the employer's business licenses
 15 22 by appropriate agencies for up to 10 business days, after
 15 23 considering certain factors.  For an intentional violation,
 15 24 the court must order the suspension of the employer's business
 15 25 licenses by appropriate agencies for at least 10 business days,
 15 26 after considering certain factors.  The bill provides that for
 15 27 a second violation, defined as a violation occurring during a
 15 28 probationary period for a previous violation, the court must
 15 29 order the permanent revocation of the employer's business
 15 30 licenses.  The bill directs the attorney general to maintain an
 15 31 online database of first=time offenders.
 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful
 16  1 status by the federal government will create a rebuttable
 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,
 16 11 or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the
 16 12 requirements, if there is a good=faith attempt to comply with
 16 13 the requirements.  The bill provides an employer with an
 16 14 affirmative defense of entrapment if certain elements are met.
 16 15    The bill requires an employer hiring a new employee to
 16 16 verify the employee's employment eligibility through the
 16 17 federal e=verify program.  The bill requires the employer
 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the
 16 22 federal e=verify program.  The bill provides that an employer
 16 23 who does not comply with the requirement must repay all moneys
 16 24 received for the economic development incentive.  The bill
 16 25 provides an employer the right to appeal a determination of
 16 26 noncompliance, and does not require repayment until a final
 16 27 determination of noncompliance is made.  The bill directs the
 16 28 attorney general to request from the United States department
 16 29 of homeland security a list of employers registered with the
 16 30 e=verify program every three months.  The bill directs the
 16 31 attorney general to make the list available on the attorney
 16 32 general's internet site.
 16 33    IMMOBILIZATION OR IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.  The bill
 16 34 requires a peace officer to immobilize or impound a vehicle if
 16 35 the officer determines that the driver, in furtherance of the
 17  1 illegal presence of an alien in the United States and while
 17  2 violating another criminal offense, is transporting or moving
 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if
 17  4 the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the
 17  5 alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States
 17  6 illegally.  The bill requires a peace officer to immobilize or
 17  7 impound a vehicle if the officer determines that the driver is

 17 20 state or its political subdivisions to reasonably attempt to

 17 27 these provisions, except as permitted by the United States
 17 28 or Iowa constitution.  The bill specifies that a person is
 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain

 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be

 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,

 15 32    The bill provides that the district court can only consider
 15 33 a determination by the federal government in determining the
 15 34 immigration status of an alleged unauthorized alien employed by
 15 35 an employer.  The bill provides that a determination of lawful

 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in
 16  6 good faith with 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b) establishes an affirmative
 16  7 defense that the employer did not knowingly or intentionally
 16  8 employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides that an
 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,

 17  3 or attempting to transport or move an alien in the vehicle if

 16  9 employer is considered to have complied with the requirements
 16 10 of 8 U.S.C. {1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic,

 17 29 presumed to be lawfully present if the person provides certain
 17 30 documentation.  The bill provides that if a person is convicted
 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from

 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political

 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge
 18 11 officials and agencies of the state and its political
 18 12 subdivisions that adopt or implement a policy that limits or
 18 13 restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less
 18 14 than the full extent permitted by federal law, and provides for
 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law

 18 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 18 28 section 25B.3. The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 18 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 18 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 18 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified. Therefore,
 18 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 18 33 mandate included in the bill.

 16  2 presumption of the employee's lawful status, as well as a
 16  3 rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly or
 16  4 intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  The bill provides
 16  5 that an employer who establishes that the employer complied in

 16 18 to keep records of the verification for the duration of the
 16 19 employee's employment or three years, whichever is longer.  The
 16 20 bill requires an employer receiving an economic development
 16 21 incentive from a state government entity to register with the

 18 15 a civil penalty.  The bill provides for indemnification of law
 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter

 17 31 of a violation of a state or local law, on discharge from
 17 32 imprisonment or on the assessment of any monetary obligation
 17 33 imposed, the United States immigration and customs enforcement
 17 34 or the United States customs and border protection must be

 18  5 sending, receiving, or maintaining information relating to
 18  6 the immigration status of an individual or exchanging that
 18  7 information with another governmental entity for certain
 18  8 official purposes.
 18  9    The bill allows a person who is a legal resident of this
 18 10 state to bring an action in district court to challenge

 18 16 enforcement officers against actions brought under new Code
 18 17 chapter 823, except if the officer has been adjudged to have
 18 18 acted in bad faith.  The bill stipulates that new Code chapter
