  6 21 to implement the pilot program.
  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to
  9 33 the bill.
  9 34    The bill appropriates from the general fund to the
  9 35 department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $50,000 for
 10  1 the establishment of a bullying and violence prevention student
 10  2 mentoring pilot program pursuant to the bill.

  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of

  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and

  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that

  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership

  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code

  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other

  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted

  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that

  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership

  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the

  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.

  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to

  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment

  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,

  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be

  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending

  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate

  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The

  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the

  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted

  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation

  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to

  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the

  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to

  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to
  9 33 the bill.
  9 34    The bill appropriates from the general fund to the
  9 35 department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $50,000 for
 10  1 the establishment of a bullying and violence prevention student

  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to

  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate

  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other

  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that

  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the

  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and

  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to

  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate

  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and

  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including

  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that

  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation

  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an

  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other

  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to
  9 33 the bill.

  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.

  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the

  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The

  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from

  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to

  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.

  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject

  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from

  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section

  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to
  9 33 the bill.
  9 34    The bill appropriates from the general fund to the
  9 35 department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $50,000 for
 10  1 the establishment of a bullying and violence prevention student

  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The

  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as

  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.

  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.

  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.

  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and

  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from

  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 22                           EXPLANATION
  6 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex

  6 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 25    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 26 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 27 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 28 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  6 29 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  6 30 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  6 31 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  6 32 basis to at least one employee per district.
  6 33    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  6 34 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  6 35 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  1 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  2 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7  3 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7  4 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7  5 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  8 20 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  8 25 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  8 26 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  8 27 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  8 28 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  8 29 other grounds.
  8 30    Current law provides that a high school student who
  8 31 participates in open enrollment in a school district other
  8 32 than the student's district of residence is ineligible to
  8 33 participate in varsity interscholastic athletic contests and
  8 34 athletic competitions during the student's first 90 school
  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject
  9  5 to a founded incident of harassment or bullying while attending
  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.
  9 10    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 11 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 12 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 13 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 14 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 19 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 20 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 21 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 22 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 23 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 24 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 25 work group by October 1, 2015. The work group must submit
  9 26 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
  9 27 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
  9 28 senate and house education committees by December 15, 2016.
  9 29    The bill appropriates from the general fund of the state to
  9 30 the department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $150,000
  9 31 for the provision of training on conducting investigations of
  9 32 complaints of incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to
  9 33 the bill.
  9 34    The bill appropriates from the general fund to the
  9 35 department of education for fiscal year 2015=2016, $50,000 for
 10  1 the establishment of a bullying and violence prevention student
 10  2 mentoring pilot program pursuant to the bill.
 10  3    The department must utilize a request for proposals process
 10  4 to implement the training and the pilot program.

  7  6 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7  7 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7  8 program.
  7  9    The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  7 10 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  7 11 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  7 12 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  7 13 communications".
  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,

  7 14    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  7 15 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  7 16 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  7 17 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  7 18 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  7 19 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  7 20 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  7 21 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  7 22 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  7 23 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  7 24 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  7 25    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  7 26 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  7 27 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  7 28 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  7 29 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  7 30 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  7 31 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  7 32 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  7 33 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  7 34    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  7 35 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8  1 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8  2 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8  3 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8  4 conditions are met. Those conditions are that a parent,
  8  5 guardian, student, school employee, or volunteer reports an
  8  6 incident of harassment or bullying pursuant to the school's
  8  7 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8  8 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8  9 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  8 10 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  8 11 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  8 12 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  8 13 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  8 14 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  8 15 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  8 16 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  8 17    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  8 18 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  8 19 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  8 21 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies,
  8 22 including but not limited to social services agencies, law
  8 23 enforcement agencies, and nonprofit organizations.
  8 24    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be

  8 35 days of enrollment in the district. However, a student may
  9  1 participate in a varsity interscholastic sport immediately upon
  9  2 open enrollment under various exceptions to that requirement.
  9  3    The bill adds an additional exception if a student's
  9  4 district of residence determines that the student was subject

  9  6 school in the district of residence in the current or previous
  9  7 school year and both the district of residence and the other
  9  8 school district agree to allow the pupil to participate
  9  9 immediately in a varsity interscholastic sport.

  9 15 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 16 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 17 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 18 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
