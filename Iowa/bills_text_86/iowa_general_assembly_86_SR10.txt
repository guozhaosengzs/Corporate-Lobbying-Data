                    SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 
                    SENATE RESOLUTION NO.                     SENATE RESOLUTION NO.         BY  BOLKCOM, DVORSKY, HART, HOGG, TAYLOR, BISIGNANO,
                            and DANIELSON
  1  1 A Resolution affirming Iowa's commitment to net
  1  2    neutrality.
  1  3    WHEREAS, broadband Internet access is an essential
  1  4 part of daily life for all people in Iowa and networks
  1  5 are often becoming our basic and only communication
  1  6 platform, and Governor Branstad and the Iowa General
  1  7 Assembly have recognized the importance of extending
  1  8 broadband Internet access to all Iowans; and
  1  9    WHEREAS, access to an open Internet is important
  1 10 for each and every constituent of Iowa as the Internet
  1 11 becomes a driver of our economy, our educational
  1 12 system, our health care services, our government
  1 13 institutions, and our democratic discourse; and
  1 14    WHEREAS, access to an open Internet gives
  1 15 individuals, associations, investors, and entrepreneurs
  1 16 the power to run small businesses, contribute to the
  1 17 marketplace of ideas, partake in civic engagement, and
  1 18 exercise freedom of speech; and
  1 19    WHEREAS, the open Internet developed and thrived
  1 20 under the principle that broadband providers cannot
  1 21 block, discriminate against, or interfere with the
  1 22 lawful content, applications, and services that
  1 23 these broadband networks carry, and that broadband
  1 24 customers may choose to access over the broadband
  1 25 connections; and
  1 26    WHEREAS, this principle, commonly referred to as
  1 27 "net neutrality", protects innovation and creativity
  2  1 by preventing broadband providers from unreasonably
  2  2 favoring or prioritizing their own voice, video,
  2  3 messaging, or other communications services over
  2  4 offerings from entities unaffiliated with such
  2  5 broadband providers; and
  2  6    WHEREAS, this principle preserved the long=standing
  2  7 ideal of ensuring that communications networks are
  2  8 open to all speakers on similar terms, while ensuring
  2  9 that broadband providers will continue to invest in
  2 10 abundant capacity rather than creating incentives
  2 11 for underinvestment, scarcity, and prioritization of
  2 12 traffic on purposefully congested networks; and
  2 13    WHEREAS, without the continuation of net neutrality,
  2 14 the public will not benefit from competition, job
  2 15 creation, and technological innovation, as our entire
  2 16 economy becomes more vulnerable to the profit motives
  2 17 of large broadband providers that could charge new fees
  2 18 for access to broadband customers; and
  2 19    WHEREAS, violations of net neutrality create
  2 20 uncertainty and the potential for broadband providers
  2 21 to extort fees from Internet sites and thereby threaten
  2 22 Iowa businesses that rely on the Internet, particularly
  2 23 our burgeoning community of technology start=up
  2 24 businesses; and
  2 25    WHEREAS, the federal communications commission's
  2 26 authority to safeguard net neutrality, and to
  2 27 ensure that our nation's broadband networks remain
  2 28 competitive, open, and nondiscriminatory in the
  2 29 carriage of our information has come into question as a
  2 30 result of a federal appellate court decision issued in
  3  1 January 2014; NOW THEREFORE,
  3  2    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate
  3  3 supports an open Internet protected by the principle of
  3  4 net neutrality; and
  3  5    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Senate supports
  3  6 the federal communications commission's adoption of
  3  7 open Internet rules that will categorically protect
  3  8 our state's residents and businesses from blocking,
  3  9 discrimination, and undue interference by broadband
  3 10 providers with the information the providers carry for
  3 11 their customers; and
  3 12    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Senate supports
  3 13 the federal communications commission's use of
  3 14 that agency's jurisdiction over all interstate
  3 15 telecommunications services as the basis of its
  3 16 authority to adopt and enforce these protections
  3 17 for the free flow of information over our nation's
  3 18 essential broadband communications infrastructure; and
  3 19    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Senate urges Iowa's
  3 20 United State senators and representatives to support,
  3 21 and make known their support, for strong net neutrality
  3 22 regulations that mandate that broadband providers
  3 23 not block, discriminate against, or interfere with
  3 24 the lawful content, applications, and services that
  3 25 these broadband networks carry and that broadband
  3 26 customers may choose to access over the broadband
