  5 15                           EXPLANATION
  5 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 18    This bill relates to the designation of a caregiver relative
  5 19 to an inpatient admission of a patient to a hospital to
  5 20 provide after=care assistance to the patient upon discharge
  5 21 of the patient to the patient's residence.  The bill provides
  5 22 definitions used in the new Code chapter 144E, including
  5 23 "after=care assistance", "caregiver", "discharge", "entry",
  5 24 "facility", "hospital", and "residence".
  5 25    The bill requires a hospital to provide each patient or, if
  5 26 applicable, the patient's legal guardian, with an opportunity
  5 27 to designate at least one caregiver following the patient's
  5 28 entry into a hospital, and prior to the patient's discharge
  5 29 or transfer to another hospital or facility, and provides for
  5 30 situations in which the patient is unconscious or otherwise
  5 31 incapacitated or if the patient or patient's legal guardian
  5 32 declines to designate a caregiver. If a patient or patient's
  5 33 legal guardian designates a caregiver, the hospital is required
  5 34 to promptly request the written consent of the patient or the
  5 35 patient's legal guardian to release medical information to
  6  1 the patient's caregiver following the hospital's established
  6  2 procedures and in compliance with all federal and state
  6  3 laws. If the patient or the patient's legal guardian declines
  6  4 to consent to release medical information to the patient's
  6  5 caregiver, the hospital is not required to provide notification
  6  6 to the caregiver or to provide information contained in the
  6  7 patient's discharge plan to the caregiver.  The hospital is
  6  8 required to record the patient's designation of caregiver, the
  6  9 relationship of the caregiver to the patient, and the name,
  6 10 telephone number, and address of the patient's caregiver in
  6 11 the patient's medical record.  The bill allows for a change in
  6 12 the caregiver designation by a patient or the patient's legal
  6 13 guardian at any time.  The bill provides that the designation
  6 14 of a caregiver by a patient or a patient's legal guardian
  6 15 does not obligate the designated individual to perform any
  6 16 after=care assistance for the patient and that the provisions
  6 17 of the bill are not to be construed to require a patient or
  6 18 a patient's legal guardian to designate any individual as a
  6 19 caregiver.
  6 20    Under the bill, a hospital is required to notify the
  6 21 patient's caregiver of the patient's discharge or  transfer to
  6 22 another hospital or facility as soon as possible upon issuance
  6 23 of a discharge or transfer order by the patient's attending
  6 24 physician and prior to the patient's actual discharge or
  6 25 transfer to another hospital or facility.  If the hospital is
  6 26 unable to contact the caregiver, the lack of contact shall not
  6 27 interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care
  6 28 provided to the patient, or an appropriate discharge of the
  6 29 patient.
  6 30    Under the bill, as soon as possible and prior to a patient's
  6 31 discharge from a hospital, the hospital is required to consult
  6 32 with the caregiver along with the patient regarding the
  6 33 caregiver's capabilities and limitations and issue a discharge
  6 34 plan that describes the patient's after=care assistance needs
  6 35 at the patient's residence.  The bill also requires specified
  7  1 minimum instructions to be provided to the caregiver.
  7  2    The bill directs the department of inspections and appeals
  7  3 to adopt rules, in cooperation with the department of public
  7  4 health, to administer the bill.  The bill is not to be
  7  5 construed to interfere with the rights of an agent operating
  7  6 under a valid durable power of attorney for health care;
  7  7 is not to be construed to create a private right of action
  7  8 against a hospital, a hospital employee, or any consultant or

  7 11 remedies under any other provision of law; shall not delay

  5 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 18    This bill relates to the designation of a caregiver relative
  5 19 to an inpatient admission of a patient to a hospital to
  5 20 provide after=care assistance to the patient upon discharge
  5 21 of the patient to the patient's residence.  The bill provides
  5 22 definitions used in the new Code chapter 144E, including
  5 23 "after=care assistance", "caregiver", "discharge", "entry",
  5 24 "facility", "hospital", and "residence".
  5 25    The bill requires a hospital to provide each patient or, if
  5 26 applicable, the patient's legal guardian, with an opportunity
  5 27 to designate at least one caregiver following the patient's
  5 28 entry into a hospital, and prior to the patient's discharge
  5 29 or transfer to another hospital or facility, and provides for
  5 30 situations in which the patient is unconscious or otherwise
  5 31 incapacitated or if the patient or patient's legal guardian
  5 32 declines to designate a caregiver. If a patient or patient's
  5 33 legal guardian designates a caregiver, the hospital is required
  5 34 to promptly request the written consent of the patient or the
  5 35 patient's legal guardian to release medical information to
  6  1 the patient's caregiver following the hospital's established
  6  2 procedures and in compliance with all federal and state
  6  3 laws. If the patient or the patient's legal guardian declines
  6  4 to consent to release medical information to the patient's
  6  5 caregiver, the hospital is not required to provide notification
  6  6 to the caregiver or to provide information contained in the
  6  7 patient's discharge plan to the caregiver.  The hospital is
  6  8 required to record the patient's designation of caregiver, the
  6  9 relationship of the caregiver to the patient, and the name,
  6 10 telephone number, and address of the patient's caregiver in
  6 11 the patient's medical record.  The bill allows for a change in
  6 12 the caregiver designation by a patient or the patient's legal
  6 13 guardian at any time.  The bill provides that the designation
  6 14 of a caregiver by a patient or a patient's legal guardian
  6 15 does not obligate the designated individual to perform any
  6 16 after=care assistance for the patient and that the provisions
  6 17 of the bill are not to be construed to require a patient or
  6 18 a patient's legal guardian to designate any individual as a
  6 19 caregiver.
  6 20    Under the bill, a hospital is required to notify the
  6 21 patient's caregiver of the patient's discharge or  transfer to
  6 22 another hospital or facility as soon as possible upon issuance
  6 23 of a discharge or transfer order by the patient's attending
  6 24 physician and prior to the patient's actual discharge or
  6 25 transfer to another hospital or facility.  If the hospital is
  6 26 unable to contact the caregiver, the lack of contact shall not
  6 27 interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care
  6 28 provided to the patient, or an appropriate discharge of the
  6 29 patient.
  6 30    Under the bill, as soon as possible and prior to a patient's
  6 31 discharge from a hospital, the hospital is required to consult
  6 32 with the caregiver along with the patient regarding the
  6 33 caregiver's capabilities and limitations and issue a discharge
  6 34 plan that describes the patient's after=care assistance needs
  6 35 at the patient's residence.  The bill also requires specified
  7  1 minimum instructions to be provided to the caregiver.
  7  2    The bill directs the department of inspections and appeals
  7  3 to adopt rules, in cooperation with the department of public
  7  4 health, to administer the bill.  The bill is not to be
  7  5 construed to interfere with the rights of an agent operating

  5 22 definitions used in the new Code chapter 144E, including
  5 23 "after=care assistance", "caregiver", "discharge", "entry",
  5 24 "facility", "hospital", and "residence".
  5 25    The bill requires a hospital to provide each patient or, if

  6 11 the patient's medical record.  The bill allows for a change in
  6 12 the caregiver designation by a patient or the patient's legal
  6 13 guardian at any time.  The bill provides that the designation
  6 14 of a caregiver by a patient or a patient's legal guardian
  6 15 does not obligate the designated individual to perform any
  6 16 after=care assistance for the patient and that the provisions
  6 17 of the bill are not to be construed to require a patient or
  6 18 a patient's legal guardian to designate any individual as a

  6 27 interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care
  6 28 provided to the patient, or an appropriate discharge of the
