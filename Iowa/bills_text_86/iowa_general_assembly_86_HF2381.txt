  8 18 full recovery from the owner, operator, or other potentially
  8 19 responsible party liable for the released petroleum which is
  8 20 the subject of a corrective action, for which the Iowa tanks
  8 21 fund expends moneys, or for which the former Iowa comprehensive
  8 22 petroleum underground storage tank fund established pursuant
  8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 18 full recovery from the owner, operator, or other potentially
  8 19 responsible party liable for the released petroleum which is
  8 20 the subject of a corrective action, for which the Iowa tanks
  8 21 fund expends moneys, or for which the former Iowa comprehensive
  8 22 petroleum underground storage tank fund established pursuant
  8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 19 responsible party liable for the released petroleum which is
  8 20 the subject of a corrective action, for which the Iowa tanks
  8 21 fund expends moneys, or for which the former Iowa comprehensive
  8 22 petroleum underground storage tank fund established pursuant
  8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 20 the subject of a corrective action, for which the Iowa tanks
  8 21 fund expends moneys, or for which the former Iowa comprehensive
  8 22 petroleum underground storage tank fund established pursuant
  8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.

  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict

 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 22 petroleum underground storage tank fund established pursuant
  8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 23 to section 455G.3, Code 2017, expended moneys, for corrective
  8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.

  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold

 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the

 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for

 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If

 12 11 for purposes of section   8 24 action or third=party liability, and for all other costs,
  8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for

  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,

  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political

  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of

 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and

 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The

 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.

 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the

 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 25 including reasonable attorney fees and costs of litigation for
  8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek

  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total

  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 26 which moneys are expended by the fund in connection with the
  8 27 release. When federal cleanup funds are recovered, the federal
  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.

 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action

  8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance

  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,

  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a

 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The

 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall

 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective

 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 28 cleanup funds shall be used solely for the purpose of future
  8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.

  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 29 cleanup activities.
  8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 30    2.  Limitation of liability of owner or operator.  Except
  8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 31 as provided in subsection 3, the department shall not seek
  8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 32 recovery for expenses in connection with corrective action for
  8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 33 a release from an owner or operator eligible for assistance
  8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 34 under the Iowa tanks fund except for any unpaid portion of the
  8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total

  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the

 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially

 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   8 35 deductible or copayment. This section does not affect any
  9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the

  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.

  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9  1 authorization of the department to impose or collect civil or
  9  2 administrative fines or penalties or fees. The fund shall not
  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.

 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action

  9  3 be held liable for any third=party liability.
  9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with

  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict

 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the

 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for

  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon

 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict

 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.

 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.

 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially

 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively

 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9  4    3.  Owner or operator not in compliance, subject to full
  9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),

 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9  5 and total cost recovery.  Notwithstanding subsection 2, the
  9  6 liability of an owner or operator shall be the full and total
  9  7 costs of corrective action and bodily injury or property damage
  9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the

  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding

 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.

 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to

 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9  8 to third parties, as specified in subsection 1, if the owner or
  9  9 operator has not complied with the financial responsibility or
  9 10 other underground storage tank rules of the department or with
  9 11 this part and rules adopted under this part.
  9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a
  9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:
  9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,

  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other

 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict

 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the

 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom

 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.

 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 12    4.  Treble damages for certain violations.
  9 13    a.  Notwithstanding subsections 2 and 3, the owner or
  9 14 operator, or both, of a tank are liable to the Iowa tanks fund
  9 15 for punitive damages in an amount equal to three times the
  9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a

  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or

 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 16 amount of any cost incurred or moneys expended by the fund as a
  9 17 result of a release of petroleum from the tank if the owner or
  9 18 operator did any of the following:
  9 19    (1)  Failed, without sufficient cause, to respond to a

  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a

 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold

 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.

 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who

 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.

 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 20 release of petroleum from the tank upon, or in accordance with,
  9 21 a notice issued by the director of the department.
  9 22    (2)  After May 5, 1989, failed to perform any of the
  9 23 following:

  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs

 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.

 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 24    (a)  Failed to register the tank, which was known to exist or
  9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 25 reasonably should have been known to exist.
  9 26    (b)  Intentionally failed to report a known release.
  9 27    b.  The punitive damages imposed under this subsection are in
  9 28 addition to any costs or expenditures recovered from the owner
  9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving

 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 29 or operator pursuant to this part and in addition to any other
  9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.

 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 30 penalty or relief provided by this part or any other law.
  9 31    c.  However, the state, a city, county, or other political
  9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of

 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any

 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights

 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek

 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving

 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be

 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially

 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 32 subdivision shall not be liable for punitive damages.
  9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.

 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 33    5.  Lien on tank site.  Any amount for which an owner
  9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 34 or operator is liable to the Iowa tanks fund, if not paid
  9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section   9 35 when due, by statute, rule, or contract, or determination of
 10  1 liability by the department after hearing, shall constitute
 10  2 a lien upon the real property where the tank, which was the
 10  3 subject of corrective action, is situated, and the liability
 10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a

 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict

 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.

 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.

 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section  10  4 shall be collected in the same manner as the environmental
 10  5 protection charge pursuant to section 424.11, Code 2016.
 10  6    6.  Joinder of parties.  The department has standing in any
 10  7 case or contested action related to the Iowa tanks fund or a
 10  8 tank to assert any claim that the department may have regarding
 10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a

 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.

 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for

 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section  10  9 the tank at issue in the case or contested action. Upon
 10 10 motion and sufficient showing by a party to a cost recovery or
 10 11 subrogation action provided for under this section, the court
 10 12 or the administrative law judge shall join to the action any
 10 13 potentially responsible party who may be liable for costs and
 10 14 expenditures of the type recoverable pursuant to this section.
 10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially

 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section  10 15    7.  Strict liability.  The standard of liability for a
 10 16 release of petroleum or other regulated substance is strict
 10 17 liability.
 10 18    8.  Third=party contracts not binding on department
 10 19 == proceedings against responsible party.  An insurance,
 10 20 indemnification, hold harmless, conveyance, or similar
 10 21 risk=sharing or risk=shifting agreement shall not be effective
 10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the

 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall

 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective
 11 14 action or third=party liability pursuant to this part, the
 11 15 rights of the claimant to recover payment from any potentially
 11 16 responsible party are assumed by the department to the extent
 11 17 paid by the fund. A claimant is precluded from receiving
 11 18 double compensation for the same injury.
 11 19    b.  In an action brought pursuant to this part seeking
 11 20 damages for corrective action or third=party liability, the
 11 21 court shall permit evidence and argument as to the replacement
 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to
 11 27 pursue the claimant's cause of action for any injury not
 11 28 compensated by the Iowa tanks fund against any potentially
 11 29 responsible party, provided the attorney general determines
 11 30 such representation would not be a conflict of interest. If
 11 31 a claimant so elects, the department's litigation expenses
 11 32 shall be shared on a pro rata basis with the claimant, but the
 11 33 claimant's share of litigation expenses is payable exclusively
 11 34 from any share of the settlement or judgment payable to the
 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,
 12  4 subparagraph (6), subparagraph divisions (g), (i), and (j),
 12  5 Code 2016, are amended to read as follows:
 12  6    (g)  An owner or operator may elect to proceed with
 12  7 additional corrective action on the site. However, any
 12  8 action taken in addition to that required pursuant to this
 12  9 subparagraph (6), shall be solely at the expense of the owner
 12 10 or operator and shall not be considered corrective action
 12 11 for purposes of section  10 22 to transfer any liability for costs recoverable under this
 10 23 section. The department may proceed directly against the
 10 24 owner or operator or other allegedly responsible party.
 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.

 11 22 or indemnification of actual economic losses incurred or to be
 11 23 incurred in the future by the claimant by reason of insurance
 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to

 11 35 claimant.
 12  1    11.  Exclusion of punitive damages.  The Iowa tanks fund
 12  2 shall not be liable in any case for punitive damages.
 12  3    Sec. 20.  Section 455B.474, subsection 1, paragraph a,

 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold
 10 26 harmless, or indemnify a party to the agreement for any costs
 10 27 or expenditures under this part, and does not modify rights
 10 28 between the parties to an agreement, except to the extent the
 10 29 agreement shifts liability to an owner or operator eligible
 10 30 for assistance under the Iowa tanks fund for any damages or
 10 31 other expenses in connection with a corrective action for which
 10 32 another potentially responsible party is or may be liable. Any
 10 33 such provision is null and void and of no force or effect.
 10 34    9.  Later proceedings permitted against other parties.  The
 10 35 entry of judgment against a party to the action does not bar
 11  1 a future action by the department against another person who
 11  2 is later alleged to be or discovered to be liable for costs
 11  3 and expenditures paid by the Iowa tanks fund. Notwithstanding
 11  4 section 668.5, a potentially responsible party shall not seek
 11  5 contribution or any other recovery from an owner or operator
 11  6 eligible for assistance under the fund for damages or other
 11  7 expenses in connection with corrective action for a release for
 11  8 which the potentially responsible party is or may be liable.
 11  9 Subsequent successful proceedings against another party shall
 11 10 not modify or reduce the liability of a party against whom
 11 11 judgment has been previously entered.
 11 12    10.  Claims against potentially responsible parties.
 11 13    a.  Upon payment by the Iowa tanks fund for corrective

 10 25 This section does not bar any agreement to insure, hold

 11 24 benefits, governmental benefits or programs, or from any other
 11 25 source.
 11 26    c.  A claimant may elect to permit the department to

 14 34 as enacted in this Act, all moneys in all funds administered by
 14 35 the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund
 15  1 board are transferred to the Iowa finance authority for deposit

 15 27                           EXPLANATION
 15 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 30    This bill creates the Iowa tanks fund within the Iowa
 15 31 finance authority (authority), and authorizes the authority to
 15 32 cooperate with the department of natural resources to create,
 15 33 administer, and finance the fund.
 15 34    Under current law, funds collected through the environmental
 15 35 protection charge created in Code chapter 424 are deposited
 16  1 into the statutory allocations fund of the department of
 16  2 transportation and allocated to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  3 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  4 infrastructure fund. The environmental protection charge
 16  5 expires on June 30, 2016. The bill eliminates transfers from
 16  6 the statutory allocations fund to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  7 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  8 infrastructure fund effective July 1, 2016.
 16  9    The bill amends the Code in several instances to update the
 16 10 name of the fund used to compensate the replacement of public
 16 11 water supply wells contaminated with petroleum from the Iowa
 16 12 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund to the
 16 13 Iowa tanks fund.
 16 14    The bill creates the Iowa tanks fund financing program
 16 15 within the department of natural resources to be cooperatively
 16 16 administered with the authority. For the fiscal year beginning
 16 17 July 1, 2017, and each fiscal year thereafter, the bill
 16 18 appropriates from the Iowa tanks fund to the department
 16 19 $200,000 for purposes of supporting the department's protection
 16 20 of the state's groundwater from petroleum releases from leaking
 16 21 underground storage tanks. This appropriation sunsets after
 16 22 five years. The bill allows for cost recovery efforts from
 16 23 potentially liable parties when moneys from the Iowa tanks fund
 16 24 are used during the cleanup of contamination at a tank site.
 16 25    The bill directs the environmental protection commission
 16 26 to adopt rules for prioritizing the use of moneys and
 16 27 eligible expenses from the Iowa tanks fund. The bill includes
 16 28 provisions designed to assure that the Iowa tanks fund will
 16 29 be recognized by the federal government as an approved state
 16 30 account, as the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 16 31 storage tank fund is currently.
 16 32    The bill states that the discretion of the department of
 16 33 natural resources regarding the prioritization of the use of
 16 34 funds in the Iowa tanks fund is not subject to judicial review.
 16 35    The bill repeals the existing Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17  1 underground storage tank fund and eliminates the Iowa
 17  2 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund board
 17  3 as of July 1, 2017. The bill repeals a local option tax
 17  4 credit available to those who remediate underground storage
 17  5 tanks as of July 1, 2016. The bill provides that claims for
 17  6 releases filed after December 31, 2016, shall not be eligible
 17  7 for payment from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17  8 storage tank fund.
 17  9    The bill includes transition provisions providing for
 17 10 the effectiveness of rules, regulations, forms, orders, or
 17 11 directives promulgated by the Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17 12 underground storage tank fund board until amended, repealed, or
 17 13 supplemented by affirmative action of the department of natural
 17 14 resources and the Iowa finance authority.
 17 15    The portions of the bill related to the transfers from the
 17 16 statutory allocations fund, setting a cut=off date for claims
 17 17 for releases from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17 18 storage tank fund, and repealing the tax credit are effective
 17 19 July 1, 2016. The remaining portions of the bill are effective
 17 20 July 1, 2017, except that the department of natural resources
 17 21 and the Iowa finance authority may begin implementation prior
 17 22 to that date.

 15 27                           EXPLANATION
 15 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15 30    This bill creates the Iowa tanks fund within the Iowa
 15 31 finance authority (authority), and authorizes the authority to
 15 32 cooperate with the department of natural resources to create,
 15 33 administer, and finance the fund.
 15 34    Under current law, funds collected through the environmental
 15 35 protection charge created in Code chapter 424 are deposited
 16  1 into the statutory allocations fund of the department of
 16  2 transportation and allocated to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  3 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  4 infrastructure fund. The environmental protection charge
 16  5 expires on June 30, 2016. The bill eliminates transfers from
 16  6 the statutory allocations fund to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  7 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  8 infrastructure fund effective July 1, 2016.
 16  9    The bill amends the Code in several instances to update the
 16 10 name of the fund used to compensate the replacement of public
 16 11 water supply wells contaminated with petroleum from the Iowa
 16 12 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund to the
 16 13 Iowa tanks fund.
 16 14    The bill creates the Iowa tanks fund financing program
 16 15 within the department of natural resources to be cooperatively
 16 16 administered with the authority. For the fiscal year beginning
 16 17 July 1, 2017, and each fiscal year thereafter, the bill
 16 18 appropriates from the Iowa tanks fund to the department
 16 19 $200,000 for purposes of supporting the department's protection
 16 20 of the state's groundwater from petroleum releases from leaking
 16 21 underground storage tanks. This appropriation sunsets after
 16 22 five years. The bill allows for cost recovery efforts from
 16 23 potentially liable parties when moneys from the Iowa tanks fund
 16 24 are used during the cleanup of contamination at a tank site.
 16 25    The bill directs the environmental protection commission
 16 26 to adopt rules for prioritizing the use of moneys and
 16 27 eligible expenses from the Iowa tanks fund. The bill includes
 16 28 provisions designed to assure that the Iowa tanks fund will
 16 29 be recognized by the federal government as an approved state
 16 30 account, as the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 16 31 storage tank fund is currently.
 16 32    The bill states that the discretion of the department of
 16 33 natural resources regarding the prioritization of the use of
 16 34 funds in the Iowa tanks fund is not subject to judicial review.
 16 35    The bill repeals the existing Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17  1 underground storage tank fund and eliminates the Iowa
 17  2 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund board
 17  3 as of July 1, 2017. The bill repeals a local option tax
 17  4 credit available to those who remediate underground storage
 17  5 tanks as of July 1, 2016. The bill provides that claims for
 17  6 releases filed after December 31, 2016, shall not be eligible
 17  7 for payment from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17  8 storage tank fund.
 17  9    The bill includes transition provisions providing for
 17 10 the effectiveness of rules, regulations, forms, orders, or
 17 11 directives promulgated by the Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17 12 underground storage tank fund board until amended, repealed, or
 17 13 supplemented by affirmative action of the department of natural
 17 14 resources and the Iowa finance authority.
 17 15    The portions of the bill related to the transfers from the
 17 16 statutory allocations fund, setting a cut=off date for claims
 17 17 for releases from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17 18 storage tank fund, and repealing the tax credit are effective
 17 19 July 1, 2016. The remaining portions of the bill are effective
 17 20 July 1, 2017, except that the department of natural resources
 17 21 and the Iowa finance authority may begin implementation prior
 17 22 to that date.

 15 31 finance authority (authority), and authorizes the authority to
 15 32 cooperate with the department of natural resources to create,
 15 33 administer, and finance the fund.
 15 34    Under current law, funds collected through the environmental
 15 35 protection charge created in Code chapter 424 are deposited
 16  1 into the statutory allocations fund of the department of
 16  2 transportation and allocated to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  3 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  4 infrastructure fund. The environmental protection charge
 16  5 expires on June 30, 2016. The bill eliminates transfers from
 16  6 the statutory allocations fund to the Iowa comprehensive
 16  7 petroleum underground storage tank fund and the renewable fuel
 16  8 infrastructure fund effective July 1, 2016.
 16  9    The bill amends the Code in several instances to update the
 16 10 name of the fund used to compensate the replacement of public
 16 11 water supply wells contaminated with petroleum from the Iowa
 16 12 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund to the
 16 13 Iowa tanks fund.
 16 14    The bill creates the Iowa tanks fund financing program
 16 15 within the department of natural resources to be cooperatively
 16 16 administered with the authority. For the fiscal year beginning
 16 17 July 1, 2017, and each fiscal year thereafter, the bill
 16 18 appropriates from the Iowa tanks fund to the department
 16 19 $200,000 for purposes of supporting the department's protection
 16 20 of the state's groundwater from petroleum releases from leaking
 16 21 underground storage tanks. This appropriation sunsets after
 16 22 five years. The bill allows for cost recovery efforts from
 16 23 potentially liable parties when moneys from the Iowa tanks fund
 16 24 are used during the cleanup of contamination at a tank site.
 16 25    The bill directs the environmental protection commission
 16 26 to adopt rules for prioritizing the use of moneys and
 16 27 eligible expenses from the Iowa tanks fund. The bill includes
 16 28 provisions designed to assure that the Iowa tanks fund will
 16 29 be recognized by the federal government as an approved state
 16 30 account, as the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 16 31 storage tank fund is currently.
 16 32    The bill states that the discretion of the department of
 16 33 natural resources regarding the prioritization of the use of
 16 34 funds in the Iowa tanks fund is not subject to judicial review.
 16 35    The bill repeals the existing Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17  1 underground storage tank fund and eliminates the Iowa
 17  2 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund board
 17  3 as of July 1, 2017. The bill repeals a local option tax
 17  4 credit available to those who remediate underground storage
 17  5 tanks as of July 1, 2016. The bill provides that claims for
 17  6 releases filed after December 31, 2016, shall not be eligible
 17  7 for payment from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17  8 storage tank fund.
 17  9    The bill includes transition provisions providing for
 17 10 the effectiveness of rules, regulations, forms, orders, or
 17 11 directives promulgated by the Iowa comprehensive petroleum
 17 12 underground storage tank fund board until amended, repealed, or
 17 13 supplemented by affirmative action of the department of natural
 17 14 resources and the Iowa finance authority.
 17 15    The portions of the bill related to the transfers from the
 17 16 statutory allocations fund, setting a cut=off date for claims
 17 17 for releases from the Iowa comprehensive petroleum underground
 17 18 storage tank fund, and repealing the tax credit are effective
 17 19 July 1, 2016. The remaining portions of the bill are effective
