In
determining
whether
to
grant
a
petition
for
a
franchise
to
1


construct,
erect,
maintain,
or
operate
an
electric
transmission
2


line,
the
Iowa
utilities
board
is
required
to
find
that,
among
3


other
requirements,
the
proposed
line
or
lines
are
necessary
4


to
serve
a
public
use
and
represent
a
reasonable
relationship
5


to
an
overall
plan
of
transmitting
electricity
in
the
public
6


interest.
The
bill
provides
that
a
finding
of
public
use
and
7


public
interest
shall
not
be
made
in
the
event
a
petition
for
8


a
franchise
primarily
involves
construction
of
a
high-voltage
9


direct
current
line
and
the
petition
does
not
provide
for
the
10


erection
of
electric
substations
at
intervals
of
less
than
50
11


miles,
which
is
necessary
to
accommodate
both
the
purchase
and
12


sale
to
persons
located
in
Iowa
of
electricity
generated
or
13


transmitted
by
the
franchisee.
14


Additionally,
current
Code
section
478.3,
specifying
15


franchise
petition
requirements,
provides
that
for
the
16


purposes
of
that
Code
section,
the
term
“public”
shall
not
be
17


interpreted
to
be
limited
to
consumers
located
in
Iowa.
The
18


bill
modifies
this
provision
to
instead
specify
that
the
term
19


“public”
as
used
in
Code
chapter
478
in
reference
to
public
20


use,
interest,
and
needs
shall
refer
to
and
be
limited
to
21


consumers
located
in
this
state.
22


With
reference
to
both
the
restriction
against
a
finding
23


of
public
use
and
public
interest
for
the
high-voltage
24


direct
current
line
and
the
limitation
of
the
term
“public”
25


to
consumers
located
in
Iowa,
the
bill
provides
that
these
26


provisions
shall
not
apply
to
a
transmission
line,
wire,
or
27


cable
that
is
capable
of
operating
at
an
electric
voltage
28


of
34
and
one-half
kilovolts
or
greater
that
primarily
29


provides
electricity
through
alternating

and
is
30


used
by
rate-regulated
electric
utilities,
municipal
31


electric

rural

or
electric
32


transmission
owners
to
provide
electric
service
to
the
33


aforementioned
utilities
or
to
the
public
for
compensation.
34


Further,
the
bill

7


With
relation
to
hazardous
liquid
pipelines,
the
bill
adds
8


two
new
definitions
to
Code
section
479B.2.
The
bill
defines
9


a
“major
oil
pipeline”
to
mean
a
pipeline
that
is
larger
than
10


12
inches
in
inside
diameter.
The
bill
defines
a
“major

11


pipeline
company”
to
mean
a
person
engaged
in
or
organized
12


for
the
purpose
of
owning,
operating,
or
controlling
major
13


oil
pipelines
for
the
transportation
or
transmission
of
any
14


hazardous
liquid.
The
bill
provides
that
a
major
oil
pipeline
15


company
that
has
not
received
a
permit
under
Code
chapter
479B
16


to
construct,
maintain,
or
operate
a
major
oil
pipeline
on

shall
not
be
granted,
or
otherwise
18


vested
with,
the
right
of
eminent

19


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
The
provisions
of
20


the
bill
relating
to
petitions
for
a
franchise
to
construct,
21


erect,
maintain,
or
operate

apply
