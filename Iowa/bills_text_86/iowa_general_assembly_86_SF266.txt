  3 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 20    This bill relates to public access to data processing
  3 21 software under Iowa's open records law (Code chapter 22).
  3 22    Under current law, a government body may provide, restrict,
  3 23 or prohibit access to data processing software developed
  3 24 by the government body, regardless of whether the data
  3 25 processing software is separated or combined with a public
  3 26 record. A government body is required to establish policies
  3 27 and procedures to provide access to public records that are
  3 28 combined with its data processing software.  A public record
  3 29 cannot be withheld from the public because it is combined with
  3 30 data processing software. A government body may establish
  3 31 payment rates and procedures required to provide access to data
  3 32 processing software, regardless of whether the data processing
  3 33 software is separated from or combined with a public record.
  3 34 Under Code chapter 22, "government body" means this state,
  3 35 or any county, city, township, school corporation, political
  4  1 subdivision, or tax=supported district; certain nonprofit
  4  2 corporations; the governing body of a drainage or levee
  4  3 district; or any other entity of this state; or any branch,
  4  4 department, board, bureau, commission, council, committee,
  4  5 official, or officer or employee of any of the foregoing.
  4  6    The bill provides that a government body may provide,
  4  7 restrict, or prohibit access to data processing software
  4  8 developed by a nongovernment body and used by a government body
  4  9 pursuant to a contractual relationship with the nongovernment
  4 10 body.
  4 11    The bill requires a government body to make an electronic
  4 12 public record available in the format in which it is readily
  4 13 accessible to the government body if that format is useable
  4 14 with commonly available data processing or database management
  4 15 software.  The government body may make a public record
  4 16 available in a specific format requested by a person that is
  4 17 different from that in which the public record is readily
  4 18 accessible to the government body and may charge the reasonable
  4 19 costs of any required processing, programming, or other work
  4 20 required to produce the public record in the specific format,
  4 21 in addition to any other costs allowed under Code chapter
  4 22 22. If the person receiving a public record requests that the
  4 23 public record be specially processed or produced in a format
  4 24 different from that in which the public record is readily
  4 25 accessible to the government body, the costs chargeable to the
  4 26 person may be higher.
  4 27    Conforming Code changes are made in the bill to Code
  4 28 sections 22.2 (access to data processing software) and 22.7
  4 29 (confidential records exceptions).
