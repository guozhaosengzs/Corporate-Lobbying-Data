 12 25                           EXPLANATION
 12 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 28    This bill creates new Code chapter 522E for the purpose
 12 29 of regulating the sale of portable electronics insurance,
 12 30 including requiring licensure of portable electronics vendors
 12 31 to offer or sell portable electronics insurance, and providing
 12 32 for fees and penalties.
 12 33    New Code chapter 522E defines "portable electronics" as
 12 34 devices that are personal, self=contained, easily carried by
 12 35 an individual, battery operated, and used for a variety of
 13  1 specified purposes, and accessories or services related to
 13  2 the use of such devices.  "Portable electronics insurance" is
 13  3 a contract providing coverage for the repair or replacement
 13  4 of portable electronics.  Such insurance does not include a
 13  5 service contract or extended warranty or insurance covering
 13  6 a seller's or manufacturer's obligations under a warranty.
 13  7 A "portable electronics insurance license" issued by the
 13  8 commissioner of insurance authorizes a portable electronics
 13  9 vendor to offer or sell portable electronics insurance.  A
 13 10 "portable electronics vendor" is a person in the business,
 13 11 directly or indirectly, of selling, reselling, soliciting, or
 13 12 leasing portable electronics, their accessories, and related
 13 13 services to consumers.
 13 14    Persons are prohibited from offering or selling portable
 13 15 electronics insurance unless they are licensed as insurance
 13 16 producers under Code chapter 522B, are issued a portable
 13 17 electronics insurance license pursuant to the provisions of the
 13 18 bill, or are endorsees in compliance with the provisions of the
 13 19 bill.  A portable electronics insurance license issued by the
 13 20 commissioner of insurance authorizes a portable electronics
 13 21 vendor and its endorsees, i.e., unlicensed employees or
 13 22 authorized representatives of the vendor, to offer or sell
 13 23 portable electronics insurance to consumers in connection with,
 13 24 and incidental to, the sale of portable electronics or the sale
 13 25 and provision of accessories or services related to the use of
 13 26 portable electronics.
 13 27    A portable electronics vendor must file an application for a
 13 28 license to sell portable electronics insurance that includes a
 13 29 certificate by the insurer that the vendor is trustworthy and
 13 30 competent, and is accompanied by a fee of $50 for each endorsee
 13 31 at a location of the vendor, or $500 per location, whichever
 13 32 amount is less, with a maximum fee of $5,000 for vendors with
 13 33 multiple locations. The bill also contains provisions for
 13 34 renewal of the license.
 13 35    An endorsee of a licensed vendor may sell or offer portable
 14  1 electronics insurance under the authority of the vendor's
 14  2 license if the endorsee is at least 18 years old; the vendor
 14  3 supplies a list with its license application of all locations
 14  4 at which insurance will be offered; the vendor provides for
 14  5 training of its endorsees about portable electronics insurance,
 14  6 ethical sales practices, required disclosures to prospective
 14  7 purchasers, and retraining about new products at least every
 14  8 three years; and the vendor maintains a list of endorsees who
 14  9 have completed training.
 14 10    If the bill's provisions are violated by a licensed vendor or
 14 11 an endorsee, the commissioner may, after notice and  a hearing,
 14 12 revoke or suspend the license, or impose other penalties
 14 13 including suspending authorization to sell the insurance at
 14 14 specific business locations where violations have occurred, and
 14 15 suspend or revoke the ability of individual endorsees to act
 14 16 under the vendor's license.
 14 17    The commissioner may issue a cease and desist order against
 14 18 a person who sells insurance in connection with, or incidental
 14 19 to, the sale of portable electronics, or related accessories
 14 20 or services without obtaining the license required by the bill
 14 21 or being licensed as an insurance producer under Code chapter
 14 22 522B.
 14 23    A licensed portable electronics vendor is prohibited from
 14 24 selling portable electronics insurance unless at the time of
 14 25 sale or enrollment in the insurance or within a reasonable
 14 26 time after a telephone transaction, the vendor makes specified
 14 27 disclosures and provides written information to the prospective
 14 28 customer that includes material terms and conditions of
 14 29 coverage; describes the claims process; discloses additional
 14 30 information about the policy; and provides information about
 14 31 the vendor.
 14 32    Costs for the insurance must be separately itemized in any
 14 33 billing statement for the insurance, or, if the insurance is
 14 34 included with the purchase or lease of portable electronics
 14 35 and accessories or related services, the stand=alone cost for
 15  1 similar insurance must be disclosed on the consumer's bill and
 15  2 in marketing materials available at the point of sale.
 15  3    The sale of portable electronics insurance to a customer
 15  4 through a "free=trial offer" is prohibited.
 15  5    Charges for portable electronics insurance may be billed
 15  6 and collected by a licensed portable electronics vendor.  The
 15  7 vendor is not required to segregate those moneys if the insurer
 15  8 provides that such segregation is not necessary, but such
 15  9 moneys are considered moneys held in trust by the vendor in a
 15 10 fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the insurer.  Vendors may
 15 11 receive compensation for billing and collection services.
 15 12    A licensed portable electronics vendor is prohibited from
 15 13 offering to sell insurance except in conjunction with and
 15 14 incidental to the business of selling portable electronics and
 15 15 related services and accessories; advertising or representing
 15 16 itself or its endorsees as licensed insurers or property and
 15 17 casualty broker=agents; paying an endorsee compensation based
 15 18 primarily on the number of customers that purchase portable
 15 19 electronics insurance, except that incidental compensation for
 15 20 such transactions is allowed; or transacting the business of
 15 21 any insurance other than portable electronics insurance.
 15 22    An insurer that issues portable electronics insurance must
 15 23 file a copy of the policy forms used with the commissioner, who
 15 24 shall make the forms available to the public.
 15 25    The bill specifies termination and notice provisions for
 15 26 portable electronics insurance.
 15 27    Whenever notice or correspondence related to notice is
 15 28 required, the notice must be in writing and sent within the
 15 29 required notice period.  Notices and correspondence must be
 15 30 sent to the licensed vendor that is the policyholder at the
 15 31 mailing address specified for that purpose and to the last
 15 32 known mailing addresses on file for affected consumers.  The
 15 33 insurer or the vendor shall maintain proof that the notice or
 15 34 correspondence was sent for not less than three years.
 15 35    The commissioner of insurance is required to adopt rules to
 16  1 implement and administer new Code chapter 522E.
 16  2    Nothing in new Code chapter 522E regulating the sale of
 16  3 portable electronics insurance shall be construed to impair or
 16  4 impede the application of any other law regulating the sale of
 16  5 such insurance.

 12 30 including requiring licensure of portable electronics vendors
 12 31 to offer or sell portable electronics insurance, and providing

 12 33    New Code chapter 522E defines "portable electronics" as

 13 32 amount is less, with a maximum fee of $5,000 for vendors with

 14 19 to, the sale of portable electronics, or related accessories
 14 20 or services without obtaining the license required by the bill
 14 21 or being licensed as an insurance producer under Code chapter

 14 30 information about the policy; and provides information about
 14 31 the vendor.
 14 32    Costs for the insurance must be separately itemized in any

 14 34 included with the purchase or lease of portable electronics
 14 35 and accessories or related services, the stand=alone cost for
 15  1 similar insurance must be disclosed on the consumer's bill and
 15  2 in marketing materials available at the point of sale.

 12 25                           EXPLANATION
 12 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 28    This bill creates new Code chapter 522E for the purpose
 12 29 of regulating the sale of portable electronics insurance,
 12 30 including requiring licensure of portable electronics vendors
 12 31 to offer or sell portable electronics insurance, and providing
 12 32 for fees and penalties.
 12 33    New Code chapter 522E defines "portable electronics" as
 12 34 devices that are personal, self=contained, easily carried by
 12 35 an individual, battery operated, and used for a variety of
 13  1 specified purposes, and accessories or services related to
 13  2 the use of such devices.  "Portable electronics insurance" is
 13  3 a contract providing coverage for the repair or replacement
 13  4 of portable electronics.  Such insurance does not include a
 13  5 service contract or extended warranty or insurance covering
 13  6 a seller's or manufacturer's obligations under a warranty.
 13  7 A "portable electronics insurance license" issued by the
 13  8 commissioner of insurance authorizes a portable electronics
 13  9 vendor to offer or sell portable electronics insurance.  A
 13 10 "portable electronics vendor" is a person in the business,
 13 11 directly or indirectly, of selling, reselling, soliciting, or
 13 12 leasing portable electronics, their accessories, and related
 13 13 services to consumers.
 13 14    Persons are prohibited from offering or selling portable
 13 15 electronics insurance unless they are licensed as insurance
 13 16 producers under Code chapter 522B, are issued a portable
 13 17 electronics insurance license pursuant to the provisions of the
 13 18 bill, or are endorsees in compliance with the provisions of the
 13 19 bill.  A portable electronics insurance license issued by the
 13 20 commissioner of insurance authorizes a portable electronics
 13 21 vendor and its endorsees, i.e., unlicensed employees or
 13 22 authorized representatives of the vendor, to offer or sell
 13 23 portable electronics insurance to consumers in connection with,
 13 24 and incidental to, the sale of portable electronics or the sale
 13 25 and provision of accessories or services related to the use of
 13 26 portable electronics.
 13 27    A portable electronics vendor must file an application for a
 13 28 license to sell portable electronics insurance that includes a
 13 29 certificate by the insurer that the vendor is trustworthy and
 13 30 competent, and is accompanied by a fee of $50 for each endorsee
 13 31 at a location of the vendor, or $500 per location, whichever
 13 32 amount is less, with a maximum fee of $5,000 for vendors with
 13 33 multiple locations. The bill also contains provisions for
 13 34 renewal of the license.
 13 35    An endorsee of a licensed vendor may sell or offer portable
 14  1 electronics insurance under the authority of the vendor's
 14  2 license if the endorsee is at least 18 years old; the vendor
 14  3 supplies a list with its license application of all locations
 14  4 at which insurance will be offered; the vendor provides for
 14  5 training of its endorsees about portable electronics insurance,
 14  6 ethical sales practices, required disclosures to prospective
 14  7 purchasers, and retraining about new products at least every
 14  8 three years; and the vendor maintains a list of endorsees who
 14  9 have completed training.
 14 10    If the bill's provisions are violated by a licensed vendor or
 14 11 an endorsee, the commissioner may, after notice and  a hearing,
 14 12 revoke or suspend the license, or impose other penalties
 14 13 including suspending authorization to sell the insurance at
 14 14 specific business locations where violations have occurred, and
 14 15 suspend or revoke the ability of individual endorsees to act
 14 16 under the vendor's license.
 14 17    The commissioner may issue a cease and desist order against
 14 18 a person who sells insurance in connection with, or incidental
 14 19 to, the sale of portable electronics, or related accessories
 14 20 or services without obtaining the license required by the bill
 14 21 or being licensed as an insurance producer under Code chapter
 14 22 522B.
 14 23    A licensed portable electronics vendor is prohibited from
 14 24 selling portable electronics insurance unless at the time of
 14 25 sale or enrollment in the insurance or within a reasonable
 14 26 time after a telephone transaction, the vendor makes specified
 14 27 disclosures and provides written information to the prospective
 14 28 customer that includes material terms and conditions of
 14 29 coverage; describes the claims process; discloses additional
 14 30 information about the policy; and provides information about
 14 31 the vendor.
 14 32    Costs for the insurance must be separately itemized in any
 14 33 billing statement for the insurance, or, if the insurance is
 14 34 included with the purchase or lease of portable electronics
 14 35 and accessories or related services, the stand=alone cost for
 15  1 similar insurance must be disclosed on the consumer's bill and
 15  2 in marketing materials available at the point of sale.
 15  3    The sale of portable electronics insurance to a customer
 15  4 through a "free=trial offer" is prohibited.
 15  5    Charges for portable electronics insurance may be billed
 15  6 and collected by a licensed portable electronics vendor.  The
 15  7 vendor is not required to segregate those moneys if the insurer
 15  8 provides that such segregation is not necessary, but such
 15  9 moneys are considered moneys held in trust by the vendor in a
 15 10 fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the insurer.  Vendors may
 15 11 receive compensation for billing and collection services.
 15 12    A licensed portable electronics vendor is prohibited from
 15 13 offering to sell insurance except in conjunction with and
 15 14 incidental to the business of selling portable electronics and
 15 15 related services and accessories; advertising or representing
 15 16 itself or its endorsees as licensed insurers or property and
 15 17 casualty broker=agents; paying an endorsee compensation based
 15 18 primarily on the number of customers that purchase portable
 15 19 electronics insurance, except that incidental compensation for
 15 20 such transactions is allowed; or transacting the business of
 15 21 any insurance other than portable electronics insurance.
 15 22    An insurer that issues portable electronics insurance must
 15 23 file a copy of the policy forms used with the commissioner, who
 15 24 shall make the forms available to the public.
 15 25    The bill specifies termination and notice provisions for
 15 26 portable electronics insurance.
 15 27    Whenever notice or correspondence related to notice is
 15 28 required, the notice must be in writing and sent within the
 15 29 required notice period.  Notices and correspondence must be
 15 30 sent to the licensed vendor that is the policyholder at the
 15 31 mailing address specified for that purpose and to the last
 15 32 known mailing addresses on file for affected consumers.  The
 15 33 insurer or the vendor shall maintain proof that the notice or
 15 34 correspondence was sent for not less than three years.
 15 35    The commissioner of insurance is required to adopt rules to
 16  1 implement and administer new Code chapter 522E.
 16  2    Nothing in new Code chapter 522E regulating the sale of
 16  3 portable electronics insurance shall be construed to impair or
 16  4 impede the application of any other law regulating the sale of
 16  5 such insurance.

 13 31 at a location of the vendor, or $500 per location, whichever
 13 32 amount is less, with a maximum fee of $5,000 for vendors with
 13 33 multiple locations. The bill also contains provisions for
 13 34 renewal of the license.
 13 35    An endorsee of a licensed vendor may sell or offer portable
 14  1 electronics insurance under the authority of the vendor's
 14  2 license if the endorsee is at least 18 years old; the vendor
 14  3 supplies a list with its license application of all locations
 14  4 at which insurance will be offered; the vendor provides for

 14 30 information about the policy; and provides information about
 14 31 the vendor.
 14 32    Costs for the insurance must be separately itemized in any

 14 34 included with the purchase or lease of portable electronics
 14 35 and accessories or related services, the stand=alone cost for

 15  8 provides that such segregation is not necessary, but such
 15  9 moneys are considered moneys held in trust by the vendor in a
 15 10 fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the insurer.  Vendors may
