  2 16    Sec. 7.    2 16    Sec. 7.    2 17    1.  A person manufacturing a packaged food item who fails to
  2 18 comply with the labeling standards in section 189B.4 is subject
  2 19 to a civil penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for
  2 20 each packaged food item that is unlabeled and ultimately sold
  2 21 or offered for sale on a retail basis in this state.  However,
  2 22 the person shall not be subject to a civil penalty of more
  2 23 than ten thousand dollars for the sale or offer for sale of a
  2 24 single manufactured lot of packaged food items, if the person
  2 25 did not know that the packaged food items were subjected to
  2 26 genetic engineering or the failure to comply with the labeling
  2 27 standards was due to a malfunction of the manufacturing process
  2 28 or inadvertence.
  2 29    2.  A person selling or offering to sell an unpackaged
  2 30 food item on a retail basis and who fails to comply with
  2 31 the labeling standards in section 189B.4 is subject to a
  2 32 civil penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for each
  2 33 unpackaged food item that is unlabeled and sold or offered
  2 34 for sale on a retail basis in this state.  However, the
  2 35 person shall not be subject to a civil penalty of more than
  3  1 one thousand dollars for the sale or offer for sale of a
  3  2 single container of unpackaged food items, if the person did
  3  3 not know that the unpackaged food items were subjected to
  3  4 genetic engineering or the failure to comply with the labeling
  3  5 standards was due to inadvertence.
  3  6                           EXPLANATION
  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill requires food items to be labeled with information
  3 10 that identifies the food items as genetically modified.  The
  3 11 department of agriculture and land stewardship is responsible
  3 12 for administering and enforcing the bill's provisions.  A
  3 13 person manufacturing a packaged food item must disclose whether
  3 14 it was or may have been subjected to genetic engineering
  3 15 when produced, and a person selling an unpackaged food item
  3 16 on a retail basis must disclose whether it was or may have
  3 17 been subjected to genetic engineering when produced.  The
  3 18 disclosure must appear on a printed label and either affixed
  3 19 to a packaged food item or placed near a container holding
  3 20 unpackaged food items.  The label must be based on federal
  3 21 ingredient labeling standards unless the department establishes
  3 22 alternative standards.  The bill creates an exception for a
  3 23 small business which has either fewer than 20 employees or
  3 24 an annual gross income of less than $4 million.  A person
  3 25 manufacturing a packaged food item who fails to comply with
  3 26 the labeling standards, or a person selling or offering to
  3 27 sell an unpackaged food item on a retail basis and who fails
  3 28 to comply with the labeling standards, is subject to civil
  3 29 penalties.  The civil penalty equals $100 per food item that is
  3 30 not labeled in compliance with the bill's provisions.  However,
  3 31 under certain circumstances a manufacturer's civil penalty is
  3 32 capped at $10,000 for the sale or offer for sale of a single
  3 33 manufactured lot of packaged food items and a retail dealer's
  3 34 civil penalty is capped at $1,000 for the sale or offer for
  3 35 sale of a single container of unpackaged food items.
