  1  7 paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), subparagraph division (e), as
  1  8 follows:
  1  9    a.  If a school district exceeds its authorized budget
  1 10 or carries a negative unspent balance for the most recently
  1 11 completed budget year and for each of the two budget years
  1 12 preceding that budget year and the school district is not
  1 13 eligible for a phase II on=site visit recommendation to conduct
  1 14 a fiscal review under paragraph "b", the committee may, but is
  1 15 not required to, recommend that the department conduct such a
  1 16 phase II on=site visit unless the school district's unspent
  1 17 balance for the most recently completed budget year is greater
  1 18 than the difference of four=thirds of the unspent balance for
  1 19 the budget year preceding the most recently completed budget
  1 20 year minus one=half of the unspent balance for the budget year
  1 21 two years preceding the most recently completed budget year.

  1 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
