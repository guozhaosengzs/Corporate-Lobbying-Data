Section
1.
FINDINGS
AND
INTENT.
The
general
assembly
finds
1


and
declares
that:
2


1.
According
to
AARP
Iowa,
at
any
given
time,
an
estimated
3


540,000
Iowans
provide
varying
degrees
of
unreimbursed
4


care
to
adults
with
limitations
in
daily
activities
at
some
5


point
during
a
year.
The
total
value
of
such
unpaid
care
to
6


individuals
in
need
of
long-term
services
and
supports
amounts
7


to
an
estimated
$4.1
billion,
annually.
8


2.
Caregivers
are
often
members
of
the
individual’s
9


immediate
family,
but
friends
and
other
community
members
also
10


serve
as
caregivers.
Although
most
caregivers
are
asked
to
11


assist
an
individual
with
basic
activities
of
daily
living,
12


such
as
mobility,
eating,
and
dressing,
many
are
expected
to
13


perform
complex
tasks
on
a
daily
basis,
such
as
administering
14


multiple
medications,
providing
wound
care,
and
operating
15


medical
equipment.
16


3.
Despite
the
vast
importance
of
caregivers
in
the
17


individual’s
day-to-day
care,
many
caregivers
find
they
are
18


often
left
out
of
discussions
involving
a
patient’s
care
while
19


in
the
hospital
and,
upon
the
patient’s
discharge,
receive
20


little
instruction
on
the
tasks
they
are
expected
to
perform.
21


4.
The
centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
of
the
22


United
States
department
of
health
and
human
services
estimates
23


that
$17
billion
in
Medicare
funds
is
spent
each
year
on
24


unnecessary
hospital
readmissions.
Additionally,
hospitals
25


desire
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
new
readmission
penalties
26


under
the
federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act,
27


Pub.
L.
No.
111-148,
as
amended
by
the
federal
Health
Care
and
28


Education
Reconciliation
Act
of
2010,
Pub.
L.
No.
111-152.
29


5.
In
order
to
successfully
address
the
challenges
of
a
30


surging
population
of
older
adults
and
others
living
with
31


chronic
conditions
and
who
have
significant
needs
for
long-term
32


services
and
supports,
the
state
must
develop
methods
to
enable
33


caregivers
to
continue
to
support
their
loved
ones
at
home
and
34


in
the
community,
and
avoid
costly
hospital
readmissions.

of

assembly
that

Act
1


enables
caregivers
to
provide
competent
post-hospital
care
to

their
family
members
and
other

ones,

to
