 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12  3    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12  4 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12  5 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12  6 of fireworks.
 12  7    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 10 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 11 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 12 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 13 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12 18 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12 19 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12 20 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 21 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 22 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 23    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 24 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 25 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 26 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 26 effective immediately upon filing.

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between

 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 11 31    Sec. 13.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
 11 32 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon
 11 33 enactment.
 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12  3    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12  4 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12  5 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12  6 of fireworks.
 12  7    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 10 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 11 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 12 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 13 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12 18 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12 19 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12 20 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 21 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 22 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 23    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 24 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 25 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 26 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.

 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12  3    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12  4 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12  5 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12  6 of fireworks.
 12  7    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 10 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 11 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 12 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 13 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12 18 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12 19 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12 20 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 21 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 22 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 23    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 24 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 25 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 26 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer

 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of

 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of

 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or

 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 11 34                           EXPLANATION
 11 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  2    This bill relates to the regulation of fireworks.
 12  3    The bill provides that the state fire marshal has the duty to
 12  4 enforce all laws, and rules of the department of public safety
 12  5 concerned with the storage, transportation, handling, and use
 12  6 of fireworks.
 12  7    Current law provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 10 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 11 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 12 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 13 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12 18 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12 19 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12 20 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 21 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 22 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 23    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 24 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 25 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 26 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The

 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration

 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend

 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 26 effective immediately upon filing.

 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.

 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each

 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules

 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any

 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or

 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between

 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at

 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules

 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 26 effective immediately upon filing.

 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple

 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,

 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of

 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or

 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used

 12  8 corporation who offers for sale, exposes for sale, sells at
 12  9 retail, or uses or explodes any fireworks, commits a simple
 12 10 misdemeanor.  Current law, however, also provides that a county
 12 11 board of supervisors or the department of natural resources may
 12 12 grant a permit for the display of fireworks if the fireworks
 12 13 display will be handled by a competent operator.  Current
 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,

 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the

 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks

 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of

 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any

 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The

 12 14 law further provides that the term "fireworks" includes any
 12 15 explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances,
 12 16 or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible
 12 17 or audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration,
 12 18 or detonation, including blank cartridges, firecrackers,
 12 19 torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of
 12 20 like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
 12 21 flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive
 12 22 substance with limited exceptions.
 12 23    The bill maintains these restrictions for display fireworks
 12 24 and provides that the term "display fireworks" shall not
 12 25 include novelties or consumer fireworks. The bill provides
 12 26 definitions for the terms "novelties" and "consumer fireworks".
 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers
 13  1 who devote less than 50 percent of the retailer's retail
 13  2 floor space to the sale or display of first=class consumer
 13  3 fireworks are required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400.
 13  4 A community group that sells first=class consumer fireworks
 13  5 is required to pay an annual licensing fee of $400. The
 13  6 bill requires an annual licensing fee of $100 for retailers
 13  7 or community groups that sell only second=class consumer
 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only
 13 11 offer consumer fireworks for sale in accordance with specified
 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually
 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or
 14 13 corporation who sells any consumer firework to a person who
 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
 14 17 misdemeanor is generally punishable by confinement for no more
 14 18 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,
 14 22 or novelties if the fire marshal determines that the use of
 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of
 14 30 consumer fireworks if the use or sale of such devices would not
 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or
 15 12 explosion of consumer fireworks at a time other than between
 15 13 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., except on Memorial Day,
 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be
 15 26 effective immediately upon filing.

 13 34 register with the state fire marshal and allows the state fire
 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or
 14 11 corporation may possess consumer fireworks as provided in the
 14 12 bill.  The bill provides that a person, firm, partnership, or

 14 14 is less than 18 years of age commits a simple misdemeanor.
 14 15 A person who is less than 18 years of age who purchases any
 14 16 consumer fireworks commits a simple misdemeanor.  A simple

 14 23 such devices would constitute a threat to public safety. The
 14 24 bill provides that a person who violates such an order by the
 14 25 fire marshal commits a simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
 14 26 of at least $250.
 14 27    The bill provides that a county board of supervisors
 14 28 may adopt an ordinance or resolution to authorize the use
 14 29 of consumer fireworks or display fireworks or the sale of

 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or
 15 11 explosion of consumer fireworks. The bill prohibits the use or

 15 14 the 4th of July, Labor Day, and New Year's Eve, and weekend
 15 15 days near such holidays. On those specified days, the use or
 15 16 explosion of consumer fireworks is prohibited except between
 15 17 the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. on the following day.
 15 18 The bill further prohibits the use of fireworks by a person
 15 19 on the real property of another person unless the owner of
 15 20 the real property has consented to such use. Under the bill,
 15 21 a violation of these restrictions is considered a simple
 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
 15 24    The bill requires the state fire marshal to adopt emergency
 15 25 rules to implement the provisions of the bill, which shall be

 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the

 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at
 13 17 conforming permanent buildings on a year=round basis and at
 13 18 conforming temporary structures from June 13 to July 11 each
 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used

 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules

 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is

 12 27    The bill requires that the state fire marshal establish
 12 28 a consumer fireworks seller license, and requires possession
 12 29 of such a license to legally sell consumer fireworks in this
 12 30 state. The state fire marshal is required to establish a fee
 12 31 schedule for consumer fireworks seller licenses. The bill
 12 32 establishes two classes of consumer fireworks and requires
 12 33 an $800 annual licensing fee for a retailer who devotes 50
 12 34 percent or more of the retailer's retail floor space to the
 12 35 sale or display of first=class consumer fireworks. Retailers

 13  8 fireworks.
 13  9    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 10 to require that licensed retailers and community groups only

 13 12 industry standards. The bill also requires that retailers and
 13 13 community groups provide proof of and maintain public liability
 13 14 and product liability insurance. Under the bill, the state
 13 15 fire marshal is required to adopt rules to permit licensed
 13 16 retailers and community groups to sell consumer fireworks at

 13 19 year.
 13 20    The bill also provides for the revocation of a consumer
 13 21 fireworks seller license for the intentional violation of
 13 22 licensing requirements. The bill establishes procedures
 13 23 for the revocation of such licenses and procedures for
 13 24 review for such revocations. The bill also establishes a
 13 25 consumer fireworks fee fund under the control of the state
 13 26 fire marshal. The fund shall consist of the fees collected
 13 27 for the licensing of retailers and community groups and the
 13 28 registration of wholesalers. The fund is required to be used
 13 29 for administration and enforcement of the state fire marshal's
 13 30 consumer fireworks related duties and to provide grants to
 13 31 local fire protection and emergency medical service providers.
 13 32    The bill requires that the state fire marshal adopt rules
 13 33 to require that wholesalers of consumer fireworks annually

 13 35 marshal to adopt rules related to wholesaler insurance and the
 14  1 storage and transfer of consumer fireworks by wholesalers. The
 14  2 state fire marshal is also required to establish an annual
 14  3 $1,000 wholesaler registration fee to be deposited in the
 14  4 consumer fireworks fee fund.
 14  5    Under the bill, a violation of a licensing or registration
 14  6 provision established in Code or by rule is considered a simple
 14  7 misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement
 14  8 for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 14  9 than $625, or by both.
 14 10    The bill provides that a person or a firm, partnership, or

 14 19 by both, but the bill provides for a fine of at least $250.
 14 20    The bill provides that the state fire marshal may order the
 14 21 suspension of the use of consumer fireworks, display fireworks,

 14 31 constitute a threat to public safety or a nuisance. The bill
 14 32 also provides that a city council may adopt an ordinance or
 14 33 resolution to authorize the use of consumer fireworks, display
 14 34 fireworks, or novelties or the sale of consumer fireworks if
 14 35 the use or sale of such devices would not constitute a threat
 15  1 to public safety or a nuisance to landowners. However, a city
 15  2 council may only adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing
 15  3 the use or sale of fireworks only if the county in which the
 15  4 city is located has also authorized the use or sale of such
 15  5 devices by ordinance or resolution. The bill provides that
 15  6 a person who uses or sells fireworks when the use or sale is
 15  7 not authorized by an ordinance in the city or county in which
 15  8 the devices are used or sold commits a simple misdemeanor,
 15  9 punishable by a fine of at least $250.
 15 10    The bill also provides certain restrictions on the use or

 15 22 misdemeanor, provided, however, that a court shall not order
 15 23 imprisonment for such a violation.
