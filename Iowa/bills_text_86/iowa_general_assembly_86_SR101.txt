  1  4    WHEREAS, census numbers indicate that an average of
  1  5 96 elephants were killed each day in the African wild
  1  6 in 2012; and
  1  7    WHEREAS, ivory=seeking poachers killed approximately
  1  8 100,000 African elephants in just three years
  1  9 according to a study that provides the first reliable
  1 10 continent=wide estimates of illegal poaching; and
  1 11    WHEREAS, during 2011 alone, roughly 1 of every 12
  1 12 African elephants was killed by a poacher; and
  1 13    WHEREAS, in central Africa, the hardest=hit
  1 14 region of the continent, the African forest elephant
  1 15 population has declined by 65 percent since 2002; and
  1 16    WHEREAS, the demand for ivory has increased
  1 17 significantly, driving up prices, most notably in China

  1 20 high in Africa; and
  1 21    WHEREAS, the federal government has proposed to
  1 22 revise the rule for the African elephant promulgated
  1 23 under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act,
  1 24 to provide a near complete regulatory ban on ivory

  1 27 smugglers to disguise ivory from recently killed
  1 28 elephants as antiques; and
  2  1 WHEREAS, the federal government's proposed rule
  2  2 changes would help end the illegal ivory trade in the
  2  3 United States and the federal government should use
  2  4 American intelligence agencies to track and target
  2  5 those who benefit from illegal wildlife trafficking,
  2  6 a trade estimated to generate $8 to $10 billion in
  2  7 revenue each year; NOW THEREFORE,
  2  8    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate joins
  2  9 the federal government's global fight to counter
  2 10 the terrorist organizations, rebel groups, and
  2 11 international criminal syndicates that profit from the
  2 12 international illegal wildlife trade; and
  2 13    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Senate supports the
  2 14 federal government's proposed rule changes to section
