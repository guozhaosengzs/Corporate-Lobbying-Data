  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 This bill makes changes relating to at=risk programs,
  8  2 alternative programs and alternative schools, and returning
  8  3 dropout and dropout prevention programs and funding for the
  8  4 schools and programs.
  8  5    The bill modifies a provision that establishes supplementary
  8  6 weighting for programs serving at=risk pupils and alternative
  8  7 school pupils in secondary schools to add alternative programs
  8  8 for secondary school pupils and programs for returning dropouts
  8  9 and dropout prevention.
  8 10    The bill authorizes a school district to use, in the budget
  8 11 year, up to 5 percent of the total supplementary weighting
  8 12 amounts received pursuant to Code section 257.11, subsection 4,
  8 13 or up to 5 percent of a modified supplemental amount received
  8 14 pursuant to Code section 257.41 for at=risk pupils, alternative
  8 15 program and alternative school pupils, or pupils in returning
  8 16 dropout and dropout prevention programs, for purposes of
  8 17 providing district=wide or building=wide at=risk and dropout
  8 18 prevention programming targeted to students who are not deemed
  8 19 at risk.
  8 20    The bill strikes a provision that allows a school district
  8 21 to use up to 5 percent of its total budgeted amount received
  8 22 for an approved program for returning dropouts and dropout
  8 23 prevention to be used for purposes of providing district=wide
  8 24 or building=wide returning dropout and dropout prevention
  8 25 programming targeted to students who are not deemed at risk of
  8 26 dropping out.
  8 27    The bill provides that when a student who does not require
  8 28 special education and who is not in a court=ordered placement
  8 29 under the care and custody of the department of human services
  8 30 or juvenile court services and who is not in the state training
  8 31 school or the Iowa juvenile home and who is not placed in
  8 32 a hospital, health care facility, or psychiatric medical
  8 33 institution for children and who has been determined by the
  8 34 school district to be likely to inflict self=harm or likely
  8 35 to harm another student, the school district may use the
  9  1 supplementary weighting amounts and the modified supplemental
  9  2 amounts received for at=risk, alternative program and school,
  9  3 or returning dropout and dropout prevention programs to pay the
  9  4 instructional costs necessary to address the student's behavior
  9  5 during instructional time when those services are not otherwise
  9  6 provided to students who do not require special education
  9  7 and the costs exceed the costs of instruction of pupils in a
  9  8 regular curriculum.
  9  9    The modified supplemental amount which a school district
  9 10 may request must be for costs in excess of the supplementary
  9 11 weighting amounts received by the school district for at=risk
  9 12 students, alternative program and school students, and
  9 13 potential or returning dropouts.
  9 14    The bill makes conforming changes relating to the submission
  9 15 of comprehensive program plans to the department of education
  9 16 by school districts requesting to use a modified supplemental
  9 17 amount for costs in excess of the supplementary weighting
  9 18 received for at=risk, alternative school, and returning
  9 19 dropouts and dropout prevention; and relating to budgets for
  9 20 programs funded with modified supplemental amounts and to
  9 21 allowable uses of program funding.
  9 22    The bill strikes a provision requiring the department to

  9 24 ways school districts used modified supplemental amounts for
  9 25 returning dropout and dropout prevention programs in the prior
  9 26 school year.

  8  5    The bill modifies a provision that establishes supplementary
  8  6 weighting for programs serving at=risk pupils and alternative
  8  7 school pupils in secondary schools to add alternative programs
  8  8 for secondary school pupils and programs for returning dropouts
  8  9 and dropout prevention.

  8 17 providing district=wide or building=wide at=risk and dropout
  8 18 prevention programming targeted to students who are not deemed
  8 19 at risk.
  8 20    The bill strikes a provision that allows a school district
  8 21 to use up to 5 percent of its total budgeted amount received
  8 22 for an approved program for returning dropouts and dropout
  8 23 prevention to be used for purposes of providing district=wide
  8 24 or building=wide returning dropout and dropout prevention
  8 25 programming targeted to students who are not deemed at risk of
