  8 18    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This division of this
  8 19 Act, being deemed of immediate importance, takes effect upon

  8 21    Sec. 13.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies

  8 23 feedstock on or after January 1, 2017.
  8 24                           EXPLANATION
  8 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 27    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
  8 28 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
  8 29 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
  8 30 production tax credit program.
  8 31    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
  8 32 for a period of five fiscal years the amount of tax credits
  8 33 that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program, which
  8 34 under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate tax
  8 35 credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
  9  1 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
  9  2 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 11 16 otherwise ordered by a court.
 11 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 11 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

  8 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 27    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
  8 28 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
  8 29 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
  8 30 production tax credit program.
  8 31    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
  8 32 for a period of five fiscal years the amount of tax credits
  8 33 that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program, which
  8 34 under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate tax
  8 35 credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
  9  1 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
  9  2 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 11 16 otherwise ordered by a court.
 11 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

  8 34 under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate tax
  8 35 credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section

  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,

  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An

 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount

 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain

 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession

  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,

  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by

  8 21    Sec. 13.  APPLICABILITY.  This division of this Act applies
  8 22 to renewable chemicals produced in the state from biomass
  8 23 feedstock on or after January 1, 2017.
  8 24                           EXPLANATION
  8 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 27    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
  8 28 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
  8 29 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
  8 30 production tax credit program.
  8 31    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
  8 32 for a period of five fiscal years the amount of tax credits
  8 33 that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program, which
  8 34 under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate tax
  8 35 credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
  9  1 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
  9  2 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 11 16 otherwise ordered by a court.
 11 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 11 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 11 19 or after January 1, 2017.

  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,

  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless

  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable

  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the

 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which

 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has

  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,

  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual

  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the

 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the

 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount

  8 33 that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program, which
  8 34 under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate tax
  8 35 credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
  9  1 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal

  9  3 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
  9  4 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
  9  5 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by

  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless

  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 11 16 otherwise ordered by a court.

  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless

 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 11 16 otherwise ordered by a court.

  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an

  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the

 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.

 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal

  9  6    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
  9  7   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
  9  8 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
  9  9 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
  9 10 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
  9 11 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
  9 12 defined in the division.
  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
  9 31 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
  9 32 application deadline.
  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 10  7 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 10  8 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 10  9 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 10 10 claimed tax credits.
 10 11    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
 10 15 either prior to calendar year 2017 or prior to the date the
 10 16 business first qualifies as an eligible business, or after
 10 17 calendar year 2027, shall not qualify for the tax credit.
 10 18    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 10 19 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 10 20 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 10 21 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 10 22 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 10 23 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 10 24 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 10 25 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 10 26    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 10 27 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 10 28 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 10 29 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 10 30 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 10 31 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 10 32 chemicals in any one calendar year shall not exceed $1 million
 10 33 or $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has
 10 34 been operating in Iowa at the time of application for five
 10 35 or fewer years, or more than five years, respectively.  An
 11  1 eligible business shall not receive more than five tax credits
 11  2 under the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits
 11  3 on a first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount
 11  4 of $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 11  5 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 11  6 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 11  7 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 11  8    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 11  9 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 11 10 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 11 11 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 11 12 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 11 13 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 11 14 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 11 15 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless

  9 13    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
  9 14 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
  9 15 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
  9 16 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
  9 17 entity providing professional services, health care services,
  9 18 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
  9 19 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
  9 20 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
  9 21 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
  9 22 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
  9 23 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
  9 24 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
  9 25 entered into under the program or other programs administered
  9 26 by the EDA.
  9 27    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
  9 28 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
  9 29 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
  9 30 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept

  9 33    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
  9 34 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
  9 35 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 10  1 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 10  2 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 10  3 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 10  4 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 10  5 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 10  6    An eligible business that fails to comply with the

 10 12 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 10 13 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 10 14 year.  Renewable chemicals produced by an eligible business
