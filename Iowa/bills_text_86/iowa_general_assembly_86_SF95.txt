  8  7    Sec. 13.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect July 1,
  8  8 2016.
  8  9    Sec. 14.  APPLICABILITY.  The following provisions of this
  8 10 Act are first applicable to calculate the state general fund
  8 11 expenditure limitation for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
  8 12 2016:
  8 13    1.  The sections amending section 8.54.
  8 14    2.  The sections amending section 8.55.
  8 15                           EXPLANATION
  8 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 18    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 19 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 20 limitation, creating an Iowa personal income tax rate reduction
  8 21 fund, making transfers, and providing for related state
  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess

  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate

  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 28 income tax rate reduction may apply.

  8 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 18    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 19 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 20 limitation, creating an Iowa personal income tax rate reduction
  8 21 fund, making transfers, and providing for related state
  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 22 secondary road fund in an amount of up to 1 percent of the
  9 23 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 24 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.

  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The

  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the

  9 24 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in

 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual

  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 22 secondary road fund in an amount of up to 1 percent of the
  9 23 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 24 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 28 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 29    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016. However, the provisions
 10 30 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 31 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional

  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half

  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount

  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 28 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 29    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016. However, the provisions
 10 30 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 31 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the
 10 32 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016 (FY 2016=2017).

  8 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 18    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 19 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 20 limitation, creating an Iowa personal income tax rate reduction
  8 21 fund, making transfers, and providing for related state
  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 22 secondary road fund in an amount of up to 1 percent of the
  9 23 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 24 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used

 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated

 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.

 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of

  8 15                           EXPLANATION
  8 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 18    This bill relates to the state general fund expenditure
  8 19 limitation by revising calculation requirements for the
  8 20 limitation, creating an Iowa personal income tax rate reduction
  8 21 fund, making transfers, and providing for related state
  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 22 secondary road fund in an amount of up to 1 percent of the
  9 23 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the
  9 24 taxpayer trust fund, up to the maximum amount specified in
  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or
  9 30 transfers made by the general assembly for tax relief, and
  9 31 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
  9 32    New Code section 8.57H creates a safety net fund separate
  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 28 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 29    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016. However, the provisions
 10 30 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 31 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the
 10 32 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016 (FY 2016=2017).

  9 33 from the general fund. Moneys in the fund can only be used
  9 34 pursuant to appropriations or transfers made by the general
  9 35 assembly to augment appropriations made for important
 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other
 10  5 reserve funds under Code section 8.58 and exempted from
 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining
 10  9 negotiations under Code chapter 20.
 10 10    Moneys transferred to the Iowa personal income tax rate
 10 11 reduction fund are required to be transferred to the general
 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts
 10 26 during a tax year.  Under the bill, the tax year beginning
 10 27 January 1, 2016, is the first tax year to which the individual
 10 28 income tax rate reduction may apply.
 10 29    The bill takes effect July 1, 2016. However, the provisions
 10 30 affecting calculation of the state general fund expenditure
 10 31 limitation are first applicable for the budget process for the

  8 20 limitation, creating an Iowa personal income tax rate reduction
  8 21 fund, making transfers, and providing for related state
  8 22 personal income tax rate reductions.
  8 23    Code section 8.54, relating to the state general fund
  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the

  9 25 current law; and the entire remainder to the personal income
  9 26 tax rate reduction fund created by the bill.
  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or

  9 27    New Code section 8.57G creates an Iowa personal income tax
  9 28 rate reduction fund separate from the general fund. Moneys
  9 29 in the fund can only be used pursuant to appropriations or

 10  1 education, employment, health, human services, and other
 10  2 programs to aid individuals and families with low income, and
 10  3 pursuant to law for temporary cash flow purposes.
 10  4    Moneys in the new funds are treated similarly to other

 10  6 automatic application in triggering mechanisms which affect
 10  7 appropriations, payments, or taxation rates and cannot be
 10  8 considered by an arbitrator or in collective bargaining

 10 12 fund of the state by the end of the same fiscal year and treated
 10 13 as a replacement of revenue resulting from the individual
 10 14 income tax rate reduction provided for in the bill.
 10 15    For tax years beginning January 1 immediately preceding July
 10 16 1 of a fiscal year in which a transfer is made to the Iowa
 10 17 personal income tax rate reduction fund, the rates for each of
 10 18 the nine tax brackets of the individual income tax are required
 10 19 to be reduced by the percentage that the amount transferred
 10 20 to the fund bears to the state's actual net revenue for the
 10 21 preceding fiscal year.  Tax rate reductions only apply for one
 10 22 tax year and do not affect tax rates in any successive tax
 10 23 year.  Withholding agents and employers are prohibited from
 10 24 factoring in such an individual income tax rate reduction in
 10 25 their calculation of appropriate employee withholding amounts

  8 24 expenditure limitation, is amended to provide an additional
  8 25 method for calculating the limitation.  Under current law, the
  8 26 limitation is 99 percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  8 27 the following fiscal year based on an estimate approved by the
  8 28 revenue estimating conference in a meeting held by December 15.
  8 29 The new calculation method in the bill is based on the growth
  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the
  8 34 legislative services agency are directed to apply the component
  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly
  9  1 calculate a wage and salary growth factor percentage.  One=half
  9  2 of this percentage is added to 100 percent and applied to the
  9  3 amount of the state general fund expenditure limitation for the
  9  4 prior fiscal year (fiscal year in progress).  The lesser amount
  9  5 identified by the two methods is required to be used as the
  9  6 state general fund expenditure limitation in the budget process
  9  7 for the following fiscal year.
  9  8    Under current law, if a surplus is anticipated for the
  9  9 general fund of the state at the close of a fiscal year, any
  9 10 excess remaining, after the surplus is applied to bring state
  9 11 reserve funds to their maximum balances, is transferred back
  9 12 to the state general fund for the following fiscal year.  The
  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code
  9 17 sections 8.54(5) and 8.55(2) and instead requires the excess
  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
  9 21 adjusted revenue estimate for the fiscal year; next, to the

  8 30 in the average wage and salary component of the quarterly
  8 31 state personal income table for Iowa issued by the bureau of
  8 32 economic analysis of the United States department of commerce.
  8 33 Under the new method, the department of management and the

  8 35 issued for the quarters of a two=year period to jointly

  9 13 original state general fund expenditure limitation for that
  9 14 following fiscal year is required to be readjusted to reflect
  9 15 the amount of excess anticipated to be transferred.  The bill
  9 16 repeals the current law requirements for the excess in Code

  9 18 to be transferred in the following order:  first to the safety
  9 19 net fund created by the bill, up to the maximum balance for
  9 20 the safety net fund which is established as 2 percent of the
