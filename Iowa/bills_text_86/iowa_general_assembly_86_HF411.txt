 12 19                           EXPLANATION
 12 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 22    This bill creates the "Iowa Common Interest Ownership Act,"
 12 23 new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that it is the
 12 24 public policy of the state that the management and affairs of
 12 25 common interest communities be conducted openly and that the
 12 26 new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open access to
 12 27 the management of the common interest community for the unit
 12 28 owners.
 12 29    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 12 30 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect to
 12 31 which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit,
 12 32 is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
 12 33 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
 12 34 expenses related to, common elements, other units, or other
 12 35 real estate described in the declaration. The bill specifies
 13  1 that a common interest community does not include a covenant
 13  2 that requires the owners of separate parcels of real estate
 13  3 to share certain costs or other obligations, unless all such
 13  4 owners consent in writing to the creation of a common interest
 13  5 community, and does not include community where all units are
 13  6 owned by a single owner.
 13  7    The bill defines cooperatives under Code chapter 499A and
 13  8 horizontal property regimes under Code chapter 499B to be
 13  9 common interest communities.  The bill specifies that unless
 13 10 otherwise provided by law new Code chapter 499C applies to
 13 11 all common interest communities established within this state
 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,
 13 17 and new Code sections 499C.402 and 499C.403, relating to
 13 18 records and notice.
 13 19    The bill does not, except as specifically provided, allow
 13 20 for the provisions of new Code chapter 499C to be varied by
 13 21 agreement, and rights conferred by new Code chapter 499C may
 13 22 not be waived.
 13 23    The bill also provides that any portion of a declaration,
 13 24 bylaws, covenant, or other contractual provision existing prior
 13 25 to July 1, 2015, that violates or is inconsistent with new Code
 13 26 chapter 499C is not enforceable. However, nothing in new Code
 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code
 13 31 chapter 499C shall prevail over any conflicting provision of
 13 32 law under which a common interest community or unit owners
 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an
 14  1 executive board as the body, regardless of name, designated
 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period
 14 13 of declarant control of the unit owners association, during
 14 14 which a declarant (the person or group of persons who creates
 14 15 the common interest community), or persons designated by the
 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.
 14 20    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of
 14 21 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 14 23 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,
 14 24 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 14 26 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 14 27 called.
 14 28    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 14 29 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 15  1 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 15  4 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 15  5 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or
 15 10 obligation imposed by the Code chapter, the declaration, or the

 12 19                           EXPLANATION
 12 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 22    This bill creates the "Iowa Common Interest Ownership Act,"
 12 23 new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that it is the
 12 24 public policy of the state that the management and affairs of
 12 25 common interest communities be conducted openly and that the
 12 26 new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open access to
 12 27 the management of the common interest community for the unit
 12 28 owners.
 12 29    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 12 30 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect to
 12 31 which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit,
 12 32 is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
 12 33 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
 12 34 expenses related to, common elements, other units, or other
 12 35 real estate described in the declaration. The bill specifies
 13  1 that a common interest community does not include a covenant
 13  2 that requires the owners of separate parcels of real estate
 13  3 to share certain costs or other obligations, unless all such
 13  4 owners consent in writing to the creation of a common interest
 13  5 community, and does not include community where all units are
 13  6 owned by a single owner.
 13  7    The bill defines cooperatives under Code chapter 499A and
 13  8 horizontal property regimes under Code chapter 499B to be
 13  9 common interest communities.  The bill specifies that unless
 13 10 otherwise provided by law new Code chapter 499C applies to
 13 11 all common interest communities established within this state
 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,
 13 17 and new Code sections 499C.402 and 499C.403, relating to
 13 18 records and notice.
 13 19    The bill does not, except as specifically provided, allow
 13 20 for the provisions of new Code chapter 499C to be varied by
 13 21 agreement, and rights conferred by new Code chapter 499C may
 13 22 not be waived.
 13 23    The bill also provides that any portion of a declaration,
 13 24 bylaws, covenant, or other contractual provision existing prior
 13 25 to July 1, 2015, that violates or is inconsistent with new Code
 13 26 chapter 499C is not enforceable. However, nothing in new Code
 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code
 13 31 chapter 499C shall prevail over any conflicting provision of
 13 32 law under which a common interest community or unit owners
 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an
 14  1 executive board as the body, regardless of name, designated
 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period

 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.
 14 20    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of
 14 21 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 14 23 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,

 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 14 26 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 14 27 called.
 14 28    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 14 29 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by

 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period

 14 15 the common interest community), or persons designated by the
 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.
 14 20    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of

 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 14 23 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,

 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 14 26 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 14 27 called.
 14 28    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 14 29 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 15  1 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 15  4 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 15  5 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or
 15 10 obligation imposed by the Code chapter, the declaration, or the

 12 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 22    This bill creates the "Iowa Common Interest Ownership Act,"
 12 23 new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that it is the
 12 24 public policy of the state that the management and affairs of
 12 25 common interest communities be conducted openly and that the
 12 26 new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open access to
 12 27 the management of the common interest community for the unit
 12 28 owners.
 12 29    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 12 30 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect to
 12 31 which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit,
 12 32 is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
 12 33 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
 12 34 expenses related to, common elements, other units, or other
 12 35 real estate described in the declaration. The bill specifies
 13  1 that a common interest community does not include a covenant
 13  2 that requires the owners of separate parcels of real estate
 13  3 to share certain costs or other obligations, unless all such
 13  4 owners consent in writing to the creation of a common interest
 13  5 community, and does not include community where all units are
 13  6 owned by a single owner.
 13  7    The bill defines cooperatives under Code chapter 499A and
 13  8 horizontal property regimes under Code chapter 499B to be
 13  9 common interest communities.  The bill specifies that unless
 13 10 otherwise provided by law new Code chapter 499C applies to
 13 11 all common interest communities established within this state
 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,
 13 17 and new Code sections 499C.402 and 499C.403, relating to
 13 18 records and notice.
 13 19    The bill does not, except as specifically provided, allow
 13 20 for the provisions of new Code chapter 499C to be varied by
 13 21 agreement, and rights conferred by new Code chapter 499C may
 13 22 not be waived.
 13 23    The bill also provides that any portion of a declaration,
 13 24 bylaws, covenant, or other contractual provision existing prior
 13 25 to July 1, 2015, that violates or is inconsistent with new Code
 13 26 chapter 499C is not enforceable. However, nothing in new Code
 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code
 13 31 chapter 499C shall prevail over any conflicting provision of
 13 32 law under which a common interest community or unit owners
 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an

 12 22    This bill creates the "Iowa Common Interest Ownership Act,"
 12 23 new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that it is the
 12 24 public policy of the state that the management and affairs of
 12 25 common interest communities be conducted openly and that the
 12 26 new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open access to
 12 27 the management of the common interest community for the unit
 12 28 owners.
 12 29    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 12 30 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect to
 12 31 which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit,
 12 32 is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
 12 33 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
 12 34 expenses related to, common elements, other units, or other
 12 35 real estate described in the declaration. The bill specifies
 13  1 that a common interest community does not include a covenant
 13  2 that requires the owners of separate parcels of real estate
 13  3 to share certain costs or other obligations, unless all such
 13  4 owners consent in writing to the creation of a common interest
 13  5 community, and does not include community where all units are
 13  6 owned by a single owner.
 13  7    The bill defines cooperatives under Code chapter 499A and
 13  8 horizontal property regimes under Code chapter 499B to be
 13  9 common interest communities.  The bill specifies that unless
 13 10 otherwise provided by law new Code chapter 499C applies to
 13 11 all common interest communities established within this state
 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,
 13 17 and new Code sections 499C.402 and 499C.403, relating to
 13 18 records and notice.
 13 19    The bill does not, except as specifically provided, allow
 13 20 for the provisions of new Code chapter 499C to be varied by
 13 21 agreement, and rights conferred by new Code chapter 499C may
 13 22 not be waived.
 13 23    The bill also provides that any portion of a declaration,
 13 24 bylaws, covenant, or other contractual provision existing prior
 13 25 to July 1, 2015, that violates or is inconsistent with new Code
 13 26 chapter 499C is not enforceable. However, nothing in new Code
 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code

 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an
 14  1 executive board as the body, regardless of name, designated
 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period
 14 13 of declarant control of the unit owners association, during
 14 14 which a declarant (the person or group of persons who creates

 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.

 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by

 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in

 15  5 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or

 12 25 common interest communities be conducted openly and that the
 12 26 new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open access to
 12 27 the management of the common interest community for the unit
 12 28 owners.
 12 29    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 12 30 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect to
 12 31 which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a unit,
 12 32 is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
 12 33 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
 12 34 expenses related to, common elements, other units, or other
 12 35 real estate described in the declaration. The bill specifies
 13  1 that a common interest community does not include a covenant
 13  2 that requires the owners of separate parcels of real estate
 13  3 to share certain costs or other obligations, unless all such
 13  4 owners consent in writing to the creation of a common interest
 13  5 community, and does not include community where all units are
 13  6 owned by a single owner.
 13  7    The bill defines cooperatives under Code chapter 499A and
 13  8 horizontal property regimes under Code chapter 499B to be
 13  9 common interest communities.  The bill specifies that unless
 13 10 otherwise provided by law new Code chapter 499C applies to
 13 11 all common interest communities established within this state
 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,
 13 17 and new Code sections 499C.402 and 499C.403, relating to
 13 18 records and notice.
 13 19    The bill does not, except as specifically provided, allow
 13 20 for the provisions of new Code chapter 499C to be varied by
 13 21 agreement, and rights conferred by new Code chapter 499C may
 13 22 not be waived.
 13 23    The bill also provides that any portion of a declaration,
 13 24 bylaws, covenant, or other contractual provision existing prior
 13 25 to July 1, 2015, that violates or is inconsistent with new Code
 13 26 chapter 499C is not enforceable. However, nothing in new Code
 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code
 13 31 chapter 499C shall prevail over any conflicting provision of
 13 32 law under which a common interest community or unit owners
 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an
 14  1 executive board as the body, regardless of name, designated
 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period
 14 13 of declarant control of the unit owners association, during
 14 14 which a declarant (the person or group of persons who creates
 14 15 the common interest community), or persons designated by the
 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.
 14 20    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of
 14 21 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 14 23 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,
 14 24 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 14 26 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 14 27 called.
 14 28    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 14 29 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 15  1 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 15  4 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 15  5 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or

 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in

 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or

 13 12 having eight or more units.  However, the bill provides that
 13 13 for horizontal property regimes with seven or less apartments,
 13 14 if the form of administration is a board of administration, the
 13 15 board of administration must comply with the requirements of
 13 16 new Code section 499C.401(2), regarding meeting requirements,

 13 27 chapter 499C shall be construed to invalidate other provisions
 13 28 of the declaration, bylaws, covenant, or contractual provisions
 13 29 of those common interest communities established before July
 13 30 1, 2015.  The bill specifies that the provisions of new Code
 13 31 chapter 499C shall prevail over any conflicting provision of
 13 32 law under which a common interest community or unit owners
 13 33 association is organized.
 13 34    The bill requires each unit owners association, as defined
 13 35 in the bill, to have an executive board.  The bill defines an
 14  1 executive board as the body, regardless of name, designated
 14  2 in the declaration or bylaws to act on behalf of the unit
 14  3 owners association.  However, the bill provides that an
 14  4 executive board shall not act on behalf of the unit owners
 14  5 association to amend the declaration, to terminate the common
 14  6 interest community, to elect members of the executive board, or
 14  7 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of
 14  8 office of executive board members. The bill provides, however,
 14  9 that an executive board may fill vacancies in its membership
 14 10 for the unexpired portion of any term.
 14 11    The bill provides that a declaration (the instrument that
 14 12 creates the common interest community) may provide for a period

 14 14 which a declarant (the person or group of persons who creates
 14 15 the common interest community), or persons designated by the
 14 16 declarant, may appoint and remove the officers and members of
 14 17 the executive board. The bill specifies that for declarations
 14 18 filed on or after July 1, 2015, a period of declarant control
 14 19 shall be clearly defined in the declaration.

 14 21 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 14 23 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,
 14 24 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 14 26 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 14 27 called.
 14 28    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 14 29 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 14 30 retained by a unit owners association that may be withheld from
 14 31 inspection and copying.
 14 32    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 14 33 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 14 34 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 14 35 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 15  1 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 15  4 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 15  5 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 15  6 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 15  7    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 15  8 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 15  9 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or
 15 10 obligation imposed by the Code chapter, the declaration, or the

 14 22 of such entities including requirements for the contents

 14 24 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 14 25 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies

 15  2 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 15  3 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
