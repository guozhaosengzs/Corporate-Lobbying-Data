  5 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 20    This bill relates to drug and alcohol overdose prevention,
  5 21 assistance, and education, provides immunity from certain
  5 22 criminal offenses for a person who seeks medical assistance for
  5 23 a person experiencing an overdose, and authorizes pharmacists
  5 24 to dispense naloxone hydrochloride.
  5 25    The bill provides immunity from certain crimes for persons
  5 26 who seek medical assistance for a drug or alcohol overdose.
  5 27 If a person seeks medical assistance for another person
  5 28 experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose or other medical
  5 29 emergency, or if a person experiencing a drug or alcohol
  5 30 overdose or other medical emergency seeks medical assistance
  5 31 or is the subject of such a request, such person shall not be
  5 32 arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, or have property
  5 33 subject to civil forfeiture for certain crimes if the evidence
  5 34 against the person was gained because medical assistance was
  5 35 sought. The crimes are possession of a controlled substance
  6  1 under Code section 124.401, possession of an imitation
  6  2 controlled substance under Code section 124A.4, possession
  6  3 of drug paraphernalia under section 124.414, commission of
  6  4 a prohibited act under Code section 123.47 (crimes related

  6  6 or violation of a restraining order, probation, or parole.
  6  7 Evidence of other crimes discovered because a person sought
  6  8 medical assistance shall not be suppressed.
  6  9    If a person seeks medical assistance for another person who
  6 10 is experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose or other medical
  6 11 emergency and is not immune from criminal liability, the bill
  6 12 provides that a court shall consider the person's seeking
  6 13 medical assistance as a mitigating factor.
  6 14    The bill provides that possession of an opioid antagonist in
  6 15 good faith is not a violation of Code chapter 124 or any other
  6 16 law. The bill defines "opioid antagonist" as any drug that
  6 17 binds to opioid receptors and blocks or disinhibits the effects
  6 18 of opioids acting on those receptors, including but not limited
  6 19 to naloxone hydrochloride.
  6 20    The bill provides that a pharmacist may dispense naloxone
  6 21 hydrochloride after completing a training program. The
  6 22 board of pharmacy is directed to adopt rules related to
  6 23 education requirements for pharmacists to dispense naloxone
  6 24 hydrochloride and procedures to educate persons regarding
  6 25 naloxone hydrochloride, opioid overdose prevention, and the
  6 26 safe administration of naloxone hydrochloride.
  6 27    The bill directs the department of human services to publish
  6 28 an annual report on the number, trends, patterns, and risk
  6 29 factors related to unintentional drug overdose fatalities
  6 30 in Iowa. The bill also directs the department of human

  7  1 treatment for emergency services and law enforcement personnel.
  7  2    The bill directs the department of human services to add
  7  3 naloxone hydrochloride to the Medicaid preferred drug list
  7  4 under Code section 249A.20A.

  7  6 properly certified under Code chapter 147A may administer an
  7  7 opioid antagonist.
  7  8    The bill provides that a health care professional authorized

  7 10 an opioid antagonist to a person at risk of experiencing an
  7 11 opioid=related overdose or to a family member, friend, or

  7 13 opioid=related overdose. A person or organization acting under
  7 14 a standing order from a health care professional authorized to
  7 15 prescribe an opioid antagonist may store and dispense an opioid
  7 16 antagonist so long as such person or organization does not
  7 17 charge or receive compensation for such activities. A health
  7 18 care professional who acts in good faith and with reasonable
  7 19 care while prescribing or dispensing an opioid antagonist
  7 20 shall not be subject to any criminal or civil liability or any
  7 21 professional disciplinary action. A person who acts in good

  5 23 a person experiencing an overdose, and authorizes pharmacists
  5 24 to dispense naloxone hydrochloride.
  5 25    The bill provides immunity from certain crimes for persons
  5 26 who seek medical assistance for a drug or alcohol overdose.
  5 27 If a person seeks medical assistance for another person
  5 28 experiencing a drug or alcohol overdose or other medical
  5 29 emergency, or if a person experiencing a drug or alcohol
  5 30 overdose or other medical emergency seeks medical assistance
  5 31 or is the subject of such a request, such person shall not be
  5 32 arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, or have property
  5 33 subject to civil forfeiture for certain crimes if the evidence
  5 34 against the person was gained because medical assistance was
  5 35 sought. The crimes are possession of a controlled substance
  6  1 under Code section 124.401, possession of an imitation
  6  2 controlled substance under Code section 124A.4, possession
  6  3 of drug paraphernalia under section 124.414, commission of

  6 14    The bill provides that possession of an opioid antagonist in
  6 15 good faith is not a violation of Code chapter 124 or any other
  6 16 law. The bill defines "opioid antagonist" as any drug that
  6 17 binds to opioid receptors and blocks or disinhibits the effects
  6 18 of opioids acting on those receptors, including but not limited
  6 19 to naloxone hydrochloride.
  6 20    The bill provides that a pharmacist may dispense naloxone
  6 21 hydrochloride after completing a training program. The
  6 22 board of pharmacy is directed to adopt rules related to
  6 23 education requirements for pharmacists to dispense naloxone
