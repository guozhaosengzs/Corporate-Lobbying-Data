  8  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  5    This bill provides that a student in kindergarten
  8  6 through grade three who is not reading proficiently and is
  8  7 persistently at risk in reading based on locally determined
  8  8 or statewide assessments, must be provided intensive reading
  8  9 instruction by the school district and must be reassessed for
  8 10 reading proficiency using locally determined or statewide
  8 11 assessments, including periodic universal screening and annual
  8 12 standard=based assessments before the child is retained in
  8 13 grade three under the provisions of Code section 279.68.
  8 14    The bill also replaces references relating to a student's
  8 15 "substantial deficiency in reading" with references to a
  8 16 student who is "persistently at risk in reading", which
  8 17 is defined to mean the student has not met the grade=level
  8 18 benchmark on two consecutive screening assessments administered
  8 19 in accordance with the Code provision, and makes related
  8 20 changes as necessary. For consistency, the bill also replaces
  8 21 one reference to "intensive summer literacy program" with
  8 22 "intensive summer reading program", and replaces references to
  8 23 "child" with "student".
  8 24    Currently, the parent or guardian of such a student shall be
  8 25 notified at least annually that the child has been identified
  8 26 as having a substantial deficiency in reading, and shall be
  8 27 given a description of the services currently provided to the
  8 28 child, a description of the proposed supplemental instructional
  8 29 services and supports that the school district will provide
  8 30 to the child to remediate the identified area of reading
  8 31 deficiency, and strategies for parents and guardians to use
  8 32 in helping the child succeed in reading proficiency.  The
  8 33 bill strikes the requirement that the information be provided
  8 34 annually, but adds that the school district must provide the
  8 35 parent or guardian of a student who is not reading proficiently
  9  1 and who is persistently at risk in reading with regular updates
  9  2 regarding the student's progress toward reaching or exceeding
  9  3 the targeted level of reading proficiency.
