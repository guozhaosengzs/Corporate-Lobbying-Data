  6 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 22    This bill amends the individual income tax brackets and tax
  6 23 rates.  Under current law for tax year 2015, the individual
  6 24 income tax is computed using nine progressive tax brackets
  6 25 and tax rates ranging from a low of 0.36 percent on the first
  6 26 $1,539 of taxable income to a high of 8.98 percent on all
  6 27 taxable income in excess of $69,255.  The taxable income
  6 28 amounts in each of these nine tax brackets are adjusted for
  6 29 inflation each year by the department of revenue under current
  6 30 law, and the bill updates those taxable income amounts to
  6 31 reflect the amounts set for the 2015 tax year.
  6 32    The bill adds two new tax brackets and tax rates for taxable
  6 33 income greater than $100,000 but less than $250,000, and for
  6 34 taxable income in excess of $250,000.  The tax rates for the
  6 35 two new tax brackets are set at rates that are approximately
  7  1 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, lower than the current
  7  2 top tax rate of 8.98 percent.  The bill also reduces each of the
  7  3 existing nine tax rates by approximately 3 percent.  The new
  7  4 tax brackets and tax rates are as follows:
  7  5    1.  From $0 to $1,539, 0.35 percent.
  7  6    2.  From $1,540 to $3,078, 0.70 percent.
