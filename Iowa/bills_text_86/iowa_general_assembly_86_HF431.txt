  1  3    1.  a.  A transportation aid supplement program is
  1  4 established to provide additional funding for school districts
  1  5 in which the district transportation costs per pupil for the
  1  6 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, exceeded the state average
  1  7 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  1  8 July 1, 2013, as those amounts were determined for that budget
  1  9 year under section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph "c".
  1 10    b.  For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2015,
  1 11 but before July 1, 2018, there is appropriated from the general
  1 12 fund of the state to the department of management an amount
  1 13 necessary to pay the transportation aid supplements calculated
  1 14 under subsection 2.
  1 15    2.  a.  For each school district that meets the requirements
  1 16 of subsection 1, paragraph "a", the transportation aid
  1 17 supplement amount shall be equal to the district's actual
  1 18 enrollment used to calculate the district's average
  1 19 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  1 20 July 1, 2013, under section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph
  1 21 "c", multiplied by the difference between the district's
  1 22 average transportation costs per pupil and the state average
  1 23 transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts were
  1 24 determined for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013, under
  1 25 section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph "c".  However,
  1 26 such resulting amount shall be reduced by the amount of
  1 27 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  1 28 section 257.31, subsection 17, for the budget year in which the
  1 29 district receives aid under this section.
  1 30    b.  (1)  For the budget year beginning July 1, 2015, each
  1 31 school district with average transportation costs per pupil
  1 32 for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded six
  1 33 hundred forty=two dollars shall receive a transportation aid
  1 34 supplement.
  1 35    (2)  For the budget year beginning July 1, 2016, each school
  2  1 district with average transportation costs per pupil for the
  2  2 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded five hundred
  2  3 eighteen dollars but was less than six hundred forty=two
  2  4 dollars shall receive a transportation aid supplement.
  2  5    (3)  For the budget year beginning July 1, 2017, each school
  2  6 district with average transportation costs per pupil for the
  2  7 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded three hundred
  2  8 eighteen dollars but was less than five hundred eighteen
  2  9 dollars shall receive a transportation aid supplement.
  2 10    3.  Amounts received by a school district from a
  2 11 transportation aid supplement shall be deposited in the
  2 12 general fund of the school district and expended only for the
  2 13 cost of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school district
  2 14 transportation equipment and school buses, as defined in
  2 15 section 321.1, subsection 69. Revenues received by a school
  2 16 district under this section are miscellaneous income and shall
  2 17 not be included in district cost.
  2 18    4.  Except for an adjustment in the amount of the
  2 19 transportation aid supplement under subsection 2, paragraph
  2 20 "a", participation in the transportation aid supplement
  2 21 program under this section shall not affect a school district's
  2 22 eligibility for transportation assistance under section 257.31,
  2 23 subsection 17.
  2 24    5.  This section is repealed on July 1, 2018.

  2 26 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill establishes a transportation aid supplement
  2 31 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  2 32 in which the district transportation costs per pupil for the
  2 33 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, exceeded the state average
  2 34 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  2 35 July 1, 2013.
  3  1 The bill appropriates an amount necessary from the
  3  2 general fund of the state for each fiscal year beginning on
  3  3 or after July 1, 2015, but before July 1, 2018, to pay the
  3  4 transportation aid supplements authorized in the bill.
  3  5    For each eligible school district, the transportation aid
  3  6 supplement amount is equal to the district's actual enrollment
  3  7 used to calculate the district's average transportation
  3  8 costs per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013,
  3  9 multiplied by the remainder of the district's average
  3 10 transportation costs per pupil minus the state average
  3 11 transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts were
  3 12 determined for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013.  The
  3 13 bill provides for a reduction in such aid amounts if the
  3 14 district receives transportation assistance aid from the school
  3 15 budget review committee under Code section 257.31(17) for the
  3 16 budget year in which the district receives the transportation
  3 17 aid under the bill.
  3 18    Under the bill, for the budget year beginning July 1, 2015,
  3 19 each school district with average transportation costs per
  3 20 pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded
  3 21 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 22 budget year beginning July 1, 2016, each school district with
  3 23 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 24 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $518 but was less than
  3 25 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 26 budget year beginning July 1, 2017, each school district with
  3 27 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 28 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $318 but was less than
  3 29 $518 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.
  3 30    The bill requires amounts received from a transportation
  3 31 aid supplement to be deposited in the general fund of the
  3 32 school district and expended only for the cost of repairing,
  3 33 maintaining, and fueling school district transportation
  3 34 equipment and school buses. The bill specifies that revenues
  3 35 received by a school district under the bill are miscellaneous
  4  1 income and shall not be included in district cost.
  4  2    The bill includes a provision that repeals the
  4  3 transportation aid supplement program on July 1, 2018.
  4  4    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  3 30    The bill requires amounts received from a transportation
  3 31 aid supplement to be deposited in the general fund of the
  3 32 school district and expended only for the cost of repairing,

  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill establishes a transportation aid supplement
  2 31 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  2 32 in which the district transportation costs per pupil for the
  2 33 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, exceeded the state average
  2 34 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  2 35 July 1, 2013.
  3  1 The bill appropriates an amount necessary from the
  3  2 general fund of the state for each fiscal year beginning on
  3  3 or after July 1, 2015, but before July 1, 2018, to pay the
  3  4 transportation aid supplements authorized in the bill.
  3  5    For each eligible school district, the transportation aid
  3  6 supplement amount is equal to the district's actual enrollment
  3  7 used to calculate the district's average transportation
  3  8 costs per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013,

  3 10 transportation costs per pupil minus the state average
  3 11 transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts were
  3 12 determined for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013.  The
  3 13 bill provides for a reduction in such aid amounts if the
  3 14 district receives transportation assistance aid from the school
  3 15 budget review committee under Code section 257.31(17) for the

  3 23 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 24 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $518 but was less than
  3 25 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 26 budget year beginning July 1, 2017, each school district with
  3 27 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 28 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $318 but was less than
  3 29 $518 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.
  3 30    The bill requires amounts received from a transportation
  3 31 aid supplement to be deposited in the general fund of the
  3 32 school district and expended only for the cost of repairing,
  3 33 maintaining, and fueling school district transportation
  3 34 equipment and school buses. The bill specifies that revenues
  3 35 received by a school district under the bill are miscellaneous
  4  1 income and shall not be included in district cost.
  4  2    The bill includes a provision that repeals the

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill establishes a transportation aid supplement
  2 31 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  2 32 in which the district transportation costs per pupil for the
  2 33 budget year beginning July 1, 2013, exceeded the state average
  2 34 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  2 35 July 1, 2013.
  3  1 The bill appropriates an amount necessary from the
  3  2 general fund of the state for each fiscal year beginning on
  3  3 or after July 1, 2015, but before July 1, 2018, to pay the
  3  4 transportation aid supplements authorized in the bill.
  3  5    For each eligible school district, the transportation aid
  3  6 supplement amount is equal to the district's actual enrollment
  3  7 used to calculate the district's average transportation
  3  8 costs per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013,
  3  9 multiplied by the remainder of the district's average
  3 10 transportation costs per pupil minus the state average
  3 11 transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts were
  3 12 determined for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013.  The
  3 13 bill provides for a reduction in such aid amounts if the
  3 14 district receives transportation assistance aid from the school
  3 15 budget review committee under Code section 257.31(17) for the
  3 16 budget year in which the district receives the transportation
  3 17 aid under the bill.
  3 18    Under the bill, for the budget year beginning July 1, 2015,
  3 19 each school district with average transportation costs per
  3 20 pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded
  3 21 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 22 budget year beginning July 1, 2016, each school district with
  3 23 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 24 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $518 but was less than
  3 25 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 26 budget year beginning July 1, 2017, each school district with
  3 27 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 28 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $318 but was less than
  3 29 $518 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.
  3 30    The bill requires amounts received from a transportation
  3 31 aid supplement to be deposited in the general fund of the
  3 32 school district and expended only for the cost of repairing,
  3 33 maintaining, and fueling school district transportation
  3 34 equipment and school buses. The bill specifies that revenues
  3 35 received by a school district under the bill are miscellaneous
  4  1 income and shall not be included in district cost.
  4  2    The bill includes a provision that repeals the
  4  3 transportation aid supplement program on July 1, 2018.

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill establishes a transportation aid supplement
  2 31 program to provide additional funding for school districts

  2 34 transportation costs per pupil for the budget year beginning
  2 35 July 1, 2013.
  3  1 The bill appropriates an amount necessary from the
  3  2 general fund of the state for each fiscal year beginning on
  3  3 or after July 1, 2015, but before July 1, 2018, to pay the

  3  7 used to calculate the district's average transportation
  3  8 costs per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013,
  3  9 multiplied by the remainder of the district's average
  3 10 transportation costs per pupil minus the state average
  3 11 transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts were
  3 12 determined for the budget year beginning July 1, 2013.  The
  3 13 bill provides for a reduction in such aid amounts if the
  3 14 district receives transportation assistance aid from the school

  3 25 $642 shall receive a transportation aid supplement.  For the
  3 26 budget year beginning July 1, 2017, each school district with
  3 27 average transportation costs per pupil for the budget year
  3 28 beginning July 1, 2013, that exceeded $318 but was less than

  3 30    The bill requires amounts received from a transportation
  3 31 aid supplement to be deposited in the general fund of the
  3 32 school district and expended only for the cost of repairing,
  3 33 maintaining, and fueling school district transportation
  3 34 equipment and school buses. The bill specifies that revenues
