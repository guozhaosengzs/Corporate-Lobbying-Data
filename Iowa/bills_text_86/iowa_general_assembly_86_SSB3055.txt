This
bill
extends,
from
five
years
to
10
years,
the
time
by

3

or

Further,

11


The

employee”
in
12


the
Code
provision
that
establishes
the
criminal
offense
of
13


sexual
exploitation
by
a
school
employee.
Currently
under
14


Code
section
709.15,
“school
employee”
is
defined
to
include
15


any
practitioner
or
coach
who
is
licensed
or
authorized
by
the
16


board
of
educational
examiners.
The
current
definition
does
17


not
limit
employment
to
a
public
or
nonpublic
school.
The
bill
18


amends
the
definition
to
provide
that
“school
employee”
means
19

person
who
holds
a
license,
certificate,
authorization,
or
20


statement
of
professional
recognition
issued
by
the
board;
a
21


person
employed
by
a
school
district
or
nonpublic
school;
a
22


contract
employee
of
a
school
district
or
nonpublic
school
who
23


has
significant
contact
with
students
enrolled
in
the
school
24


district
or
nonpublic
school;
or
a
person
who
performs
services
25


as
a
volunteer
for
a
school
district
or
nonpublic
school
and
26


who
has
significant
contact
with
students
enrolled
in
the
27


school
district
or
nonpublic
school.
28


However,
the
bill
provides
that
the
definition
of
“school
29


employee”
does
not
include
a
student
enrolled
in
a
school
30


district
or
nonpublic
school,
or
a
person
who
is
a
school
31


volunteer
or
who
holds
a
coaching
authorization
if
such
person
32


is
less
than
four
years
older
than
the
student
and
is
not
in
33


a
position
of
direct
authority
over
the
student.
Further,
34


the
provisions
related
to
the
definition
do
not
