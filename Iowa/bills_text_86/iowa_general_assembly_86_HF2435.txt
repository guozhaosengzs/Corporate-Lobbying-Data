  6 34                           EXPLANATION
  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.
  9 19    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 10 division of revenue under this section that is adopted on or
  6 11 after the effective date of this Act shall be limited to twenty
  6 12 years from the calendar year following the calendar year in
  6 13 which the municipality first certifies to the county auditor
  6 14 the amount of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that
  6 15 qualify for payment from the division of revenue provided
  6 16 for in this section. The urban renewal area, including all
  6 17 applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and ordinances, shall
  6 18 terminate and be of no further force and effect following the
  6 19 twenty=year period provided in this subsection.
  6 20    b.  An ordinance providing for a division of revenue under
  6 21 this section that is adopted on or after the effective date
  6 22 of this Act for an urban renewal area that contains slum or
  6 23 blighted conditions shall be limited to twenty=five years from
  6 24 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  6 25 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  6 26 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  6 27 payment from the division of revenue provided in this section.
  6 28 The urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  6 29 plans, projects, and ordinances, shall terminate and be of no
  6 30 further force and effect following the twenty=five=year period
  6 31 provided in this subsection.
  6 32    Sec. 9.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  6 33 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  6 34                           EXPLANATION
  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.
  9 19    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal

  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,

  6 34                           EXPLANATION
  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.

  6 20    b.  An ordinance providing for a division of revenue under
  6 21 this section that is adopted on or after the effective date
  6 22 of this Act for an urban renewal area that contains slum or
  6 23 blighted conditions shall be limited to twenty=five years from

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,

  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for

  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and

  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the

  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter
  9 18 357H.

  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted

  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property

  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal

  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and

  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and

  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted

  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect

  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the

  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill relates to Iowa's urban renewal law.
  7  3    The bill requires the annual report prepared by the
  7  4 legislative services agency, in consultation with the
  7  5 department of management, under Code section 331.403, to
  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone
  7  7 that filed an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal
  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the
  7 10 fiscal year, and which qualify for payment from the special
  7 11 fund created in Code section 403.19, including interest
  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of
  7 15 the bill shall not include the use of taxes resulting from
  7 16 a division of revenue for a public building that is exempt
  7 17 from taxation, including the grounds of, and the erection,
  7 18 equipment, remodeling, maintenance, repair, or reconstruction
  7 19 of, and additions or extensions to, such a building. The bill
  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.

  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,

  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and

  7  6 contain a list of each county, city, or rural improvement zone

  7  8 year and each such entity's reported amount of loans, advances,
  7  9 indebtedness, or bonds that remain unpaid at the close of the

  7 12 negotiated on such loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds.
  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban

  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a

  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.

  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under

  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal

  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and

  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of

  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of
  7 30 a municipality within which the local governing body of the
  7 31 municipality determines that the presence of a substantial
  7 32 number of slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures;
  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for
  9 11 payment from the division of revenue.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits
  9 13 under new Code section 403.18A and the limitations on the
  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply
  9 16 to divisions of taxes established by community colleges under
  9 17 Code chapter 260E or rural improvement zones under Code chapter

  7 13    The bill provides that urban renewal plans and urban
  7 14 renewal projects approved on or after the effective date of

  7 20 also modifies provisions governing the use of such revenues
  7 21 for public buildings for plans and projects approved before
  7 22 the effective date of the bill to include the maintenance and
  7 23 repair of such public buildings.
  7 24    Code chapter 403 governs the criteria upon which an
  7 25 urban renewal area may be established, which may include a
  7 26 determination that an area is a "blighted area".  The bill
  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of
  7 29 the bill.  For such areas, "blighted area" means an area of

  7 33 insanitary or unsafe conditions; deterioration of site or other
  7 34 improvements; or the existence of conditions which endanger
  7 35 life or property by fire and other causes; or any combination
  8  1 of these factors; substantially impairs or arrests the sound
  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal
  8 11 area in existence on the effective date of the bill for which
  8 12 an ordinance providing for a division of revenue was adopted
  8 13 before the effective date of the bill and that is not limited
  8 14 in duration under Code section 403.17, subsection 10 (20 years)
  8 15 or Code section 403.22, subsection 5 (10 years) shall be
  8 16 subject to the duration limitations established in the bill.
  8 17 For such an urban renewal area that is based on a finding that
  8 18 the area is an economic development area and that no part
  8 19 contains slum or blighted conditions, the urban renewal area,
  8 20 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  8 21 ordinances providing for a division of revenue, shall terminate
  8 22 and be of no further force and effect on July 1, 2036. If,
  8 23 however, such an urban renewal area is based on a finding that
  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
  8 27 revenue, shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
  8 28 on July 1, 2041.
  8 29    The bill provides that, except for a division of revenue
  8 30 authorized for certain housing and residential development
  8 31 under Code section 403.22, an ordinance providing for a
  8 32 division of revenue that is adopted on or after the effective
  8 33 date of the bill shall be limited to 20 years from the calendar
  8 34 year following the calendar year in which the municipality
  8 35 first certifies to the county auditor the amount of any loans,
  9  1 advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for payment from
  9  2 the division of revenue, at which time the urban renewal area,
  9  3 including all applicable urban renewal plans, projects, and
  9  4 ordinances, shall terminate and be of no further force and
  9  5 effect.  If, however, the urban renewal area for which such
  9  6 an ordinance is adopted contains slum or blighted conditions,
  9  7 the division of revenue shall be limited to 25 years from
  9  8 the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
  9  9 municipality first certifies to the county auditor the amount
  9 10 of any loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds that qualify for

  9 12    The bill specifies that the urban renewal duration limits

  9 14 duration of ordinances providing for a division of revenue
  9 15 under Code section 403.19, new subsection 3A, shall not apply

  7 27 establishes a definition of "blighted area" for those urban
  7 28 renewal areas established on or after the effective date of

  8  2 growth of a municipality, retards the provision of housing
  8  3 accommodations, or constitutes an economic or social liability
  8  4 and is a menace to the public health, safety, or welfare in
  8  5 its present condition and use. In addition, a disaster area
  8  6 under Code section 403.5, subsection 7, constitutes a "blighted
  8  7 area". However, "blighted area" does not include real property
  8  8 assessed as agricultural property for purposes of property
  8  9 taxation.
  8 10    New Code section 403.18A provides that an urban renewal

  8 24 all or a part of the area contains slum or blighted conditions,
  8 25 the urban renewal area, including all applicable urban renewal
  8 26 plans, projects, and ordinances providing for a division of
