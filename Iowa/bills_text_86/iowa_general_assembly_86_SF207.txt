  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health
  5 11 services.
  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.

  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person
  6 13 who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary basis
  6 14 under Code chapter 229 may be confined and treated in another
  6 15 state pursuant to a contract executed under the bill and a
  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident
  7 13 escaped.

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental

  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,

  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of

  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of

  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for

  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all

  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or

  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section

  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that

  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health
  5 11 services.
  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person
  6 13 who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary basis

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident
  7 13 escaped.

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by

  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health
  5 11 services.
  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person
  6 13 who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary basis
  6 14 under Code chapter 229 may be confined and treated in another
  6 15 state pursuant to a contract executed under the bill and a
  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident
  7 13 escaped.

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by

  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of

  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident
  7 13 escaped.

  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health

  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.

  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by

  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health

  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all

  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or

  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,

  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health
  5 11 services.
  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of

  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.

  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean

  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.

  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving

  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental

  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that

  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by

  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  4  1 persons within its borders and is liable for the cost of such
  4  2 action to the extent that it would be liable for costs if its

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health
  5 11 services.
  5 12    CONTRACT FOR TREATMENT.  The bill provides that a region
  5 13 or county as defined in the bill in Iowa may contract with
  5 14 a public or private agency in a bordering state to secure
  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive
  5 17 services through a region or county in Iowa.  Similarly,
  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or
  5 26 Wisconsin, "county" to mean a county that has been exempted by
  5 27 the director of human services from being required to enter
  5 28 into a regional mental health and disability services system,
  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly
  5 32 executed until the director of human services has reviewed
  5 33 and approved the contract, determined that the receiving
  5 34 agency provides services in accordance with the standards of
  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental
  6 10 health treatment records of the person as provided under Code
  6 11 section 228.5 (administrative disclosures).
  6 12    INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS.  The bill provides that a person

  6 16 person who is detained, committed, or placed on an involuntary
  6 17 basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined
  6 18 and treated pursuant to a contract executed under the bill.
  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the
  7 12 extent that it would be liable for costs if its own resident
  7 13 escaped.

  3 31 state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to

  4  1 persons within its borders and is liable for the cost of such
  4  2 action to the extent that it would be liable for costs if its
  4  3 own resident escaped.

  5 15 mental health treatment for persons in both voluntary and
  5 16 involuntary commitment cases under Code chapter 229 who receive

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on
  5 22 probation or parole, or who is the subject of a presentence
  5 23 investigation is not eligible to receive such interstate mental
  5 24 health treatment. The bill defines "bordering state" to mean
  5 25 Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, or

  5 29 and "region" to mean a mental health and disability services
  5 30 region formed in accordance with Code section 331.389.
  5 31    The bill provides that a contract shall not be validly

  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section
  6  5 228.2 relating to prohibitions on the disclosure of mental
  6  6 health information applies to mental health treatment records
  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that
  6  9 the sending agency has the same right of access to the mental

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.
  7  2    ESCAPE.  If a person receiving services pursuant to a
  7  3 contract under this Code section escapes from the receiving
  7  4 agency and the person at the time of the escape is subject to
  7  5 involuntary confinement under the law of the sending state, the
  7  6 receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to recapture
  7  7 the escapee. The receiving agency shall immediately report
  7  8 the escape to the sending agency. The receiving state has the
  7  9 primary responsibility for, and the authority to direct, the
  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill relates to interstate contracts for mental health

  5 18 a region or county may contract with a public or private
  5 19 agency in a bordering state to provide services for residents
  5 20 of the bordering state in approved treatment facilities in
  5 21 this state.  A person serving a criminal sentence, who is on

  5 35 this state, and has certified that the receiving state's laws
  6  1 governing patient rights are substantially similar to those of
  6  2 this state. The bill specifies certain provisions that must be
  6  3 included in the contract.
  6  4    TREATMENT RECORDS.  The bill provides that Code section

  6  7 of a person receiving services pursuant to a contract under
  6  8 the bill through a receiving agency in this state, except that

  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under
  6 25 the law of the sending state. Except in an emergency, such a
  6 26 person shall not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a
  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of
  6 29 the sending state.
  6 30    APPLICABLE LAW.  While in the receiving state pursuant to a
  6 31 contract executed under the bill, a person is subject to all
  6 32 of the provisions of law and regulations applicable to persons
  6 33 detained, committed, or placed pursuant to the corresponding
  6 34 laws of the receiving state, except those laws and regulations
  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,
  7  1 reexaminations, and extensions of confinement.

  7 10 pursuit, retaking, and prosecution of escaped persons within
  7 11 its borders and is liable for the cost of such action to the

  6 23 is transferred to a receiving state is  considered to be in the
  6 24 legal custody of the authority responsible for the person under

  6 27 facility of the receiving agency without the specific approval
  6 28 of the authority responsible for the person under the law of

  6 35 of the receiving state relating to length of confinement,

  6 19 Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are
  6 20 granted recognition and reciprocity in the receiving state for
  6 21 a person covered by a contract. A person who is detained,
  6 22 committed, or placed under the law of a sending state and who
