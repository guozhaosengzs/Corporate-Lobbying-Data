  3 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 16    This bill relates to the authorization procedures for county
  3 17 projects involving real property by raising certain limitation
  3 18 amounts and by making an exception for projects involving
  3 19 property to be used by the judicial branch.
  3 20    Generally, indebtedness incurred for an essential county
  3 21 purpose does not require approval of the voters.
  3 22    The bill increases the threshold amounts that determine
  3 23 whether a project can be undertaken using the procedures for
  3 24 essential county purpose bonds when the project involves a
  3 25 lease contract or lease=purchase contract. For counties with a
  3 26 population of 25,000 or less, the threshold amount is increased
  3 27 from $400,000 to $600,000; for counties with a population of
  3 28 more than 25,000 but not more than 50,000, the threshold amount
  3 29 is increased from $500,000 to $750,000; for counties with a
  3 30 population of more than 50,000 but not more than 100,000, the
  3 31 threshold amount is increased from $600,000 to $900,000; for
  3 32 counties with a population of more than 100,000 but not more
  3 33 than 200,000, the threshold amount is increased from $800,000
  3 34 to $1.2 million; and for counties with a population of more
  3 35 than 200,000, the threshold amount is increased from $1 million
  4  1 to $1.5 million.
  4  2    The bill amends the definition of "essential county purpose"
  4  3 relating to the issuance of bonds for public buildings by
  4  4 increasing the threshold amounts on the principal amount of
  4  5 the bonds if at least 25 percent of the public building and
  4  6 grounds will be used or occupied by the judicial branch in a
  4  7 county with a population of 200,000 or less, or when at least
  4  8 50 percent of the public building and grounds will be used or
  4  9 occupied by the judicial branch in a county with a population
  4 10 of more than 200,000.   The bill increases the threshold amounts
  4 11 in the following manner: for counties with a population of
  4 12 25,000 or less, the threshold amount is increased from $600,000
  4 13 to $1.3 million; for counties with a population of more than
  4 14 25,000 but not more than 50,000, the threshold amount is
  4 15 increased from $750,000 to $1.6 million; for counties with a
  4 16 population of more than 50,000 but not more than 100,000, the
  4 17 threshold amount is increased from $900,000 to $1.9 million;
  4 18 for counties with a population of more than 100,000 but not
  4 19 more than 200,000, the threshold amount is increased from $1.2
  4 20 million to $2.5 million; and for counties with a population of
  4 21 more than 200,000, the threshold amount increases from $1.5
  4 22 million to $3.2 million.
  4 23    Also, under current law, the threshold amounts are linked to
  4 24 the cost of the project. The bill links the threshold amounts
  4 25 to the principal amount of the bonds.
