Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


finds
and
declares
all
of
the
following:
2


1.
Despite
the
potential
benefits
associated
with
3


electronic
funds
transfer
payments,
many
health
care
providers
4


are
being
subjected
to
fees
associated
with
electronic
payment
5


that
essentially
reduce
their
contracted
fee
amounts.
6


2.
Some
health
care
providers
are
being
subjected
to
7


percentage-based
fees
for
federal
Health
Insurance
Portability
8


and
Accountability
Act
——
standard
automated
clearing
house
9


electronic
funds
transfer
payments
when
the
only
fee
that
10


should
be
assessed
with
automated
clearing
house
electronic
11


funds
transfer
payments
is
a
nominal
banking
fee.
12


3.
In
recent
years,
many
health
insurers
have
started
paying
13


health
care
providers
through
payer-issued
credit
cards,
which
14


are
often
virtual
credit
cards,
thereby
shifting
the
costs
of
15


transferring
money
electronically
from
the
health
insurer
to
16


the
health
care
provider.
17


4.
Although
credit
cards
are
a
valid
electronic
alternative
18


to
paper
checks,
the
use
of
credit
cards
for
payment
by
health
19


insurers
requires
health
care
providers
to
manually
enter
20


payments
into
the
health
care
providers’
own
credit
card
21


processing
systems.
22


5.
Processing
payments
through
a
credit
card
system
often
23


comes
at
a
significant
cost
to
health
care
providers,
as
the
24


payments
are
subject
to
interchange
and
transaction
fees,
25


thereby
reducing
the
agreed
upon
contractual
fee
amount
26


received
by
the
health
care
provider
for
the
provided
health
27


care
services.


28


6.
Health
care
providers
are
often
unaware
of
these
high
29


interchange
and
transaction
fees
when
accepting
credit
card
30


payments.
31


7.
Unlike
patient
credit
card
payments,
health
insurer
32


credit
card
payments
do
not
offer
significant
risk
reduction
33


for
health
care
providers,
but
nevertheless
carry
increased
34


processing
charges.
