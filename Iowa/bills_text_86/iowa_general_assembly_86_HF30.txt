  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  3    a.  "Labor organization" means an area or state building
  1  4 and construction trades or crafts council, organization, or
  1  5 association or a comparable body.
  1  6    b.  "Large=scale construction project" means the
  1  7 construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion,
  1  8 extension, repair or improvement of a vertical public works
  1  9 project, including a building and other real property=related
  1 10 project, where the total project cost is twenty=five million
  1 11 dollars or more.
  1 12    c.  "Project labor agreement" means a comprehensive pre=hire
  1 13 collective bargaining agreement that is negotiated between a
  1 14 project's owner and an appropriate labor organization and sets
  1 15 out the basic terms and working conditions for that particular
  1 16 project.
  1 17    2.  A state agency shall consider using a project labor
  1 18 agreement in connection with a large=scale construction project
  1 19 as provided in this section.
  1 20    3.  In awarding a contract in connection with a large=scale
  1 21 construction project, or in obligating funds pursuant to such a
  1 22 contract, a state agency, on a project=by=project basis, may
  1 23 require the use of a project labor agreement where the use will
  1 24 advance the state's interest.  In making the decision whether
  1 25 to use a project labor agreement, the state agency shall
  1 26 consider the following factors:
  1 27    a.  The potential for a labor disruption, such as a strike,
  1 28 lockout, or slowdown, which could affect the timely completion
  1 29 of the project.
  1 30    b.  The number of trades and crafts anticipated to be used
  1 31 on the project.
  1 32    c.  The need and urgency of the project and the harm to the
  1 33 public if the completion of the project is delayed.
  1 34    d.  The size and complexity of the project and the time
  1 35 needed for its completion.
  2  1    e.  The benefits to the public from the use of a project
  2  2 labor agreement relative to a project's cost, efficiency,
  2  3 quality, safety, and timeliness of completion.
  2  4    f.  The ability to ensure compliance with all applicable
  2  5 state laws and rules governing safety and health, equal
  2  6 employment opportunity, labor, and employment standards.
  2  7    4.  If a state agency determines that the use of a project
  2  8 labor agreement will advance the state's interest, the state
  2  9 agency may require that every contractor or subcontractor
  2 10 on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or
  2 11 become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more
  2 12 appropriate labor organizations.  The decision to use a project
  2 13 labor agreement shall be supported by written findings by
  2 14 the affected state agency which demonstrate how the use of a
  2 15 project labor agreement will benefit the state's interest,
  2 16 particularly with respect to the factors enumerated in
  2 17 subsection 3.
  2 18    5.  A project labor agreement reached pursuant to this
  2 19 section shall do all of the following:
  2 20    a.  Bind all contractors and subcontractors on the
  2 21 large=scale construction project through the inclusion of
  2 22 appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation
  2 23 provisions and contract documents.
  2 24    b.  Allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for
  2 25 contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are
  2 26 otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements.
  2 27    c.  Contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar
  2 28 job disruptions.
  2 29    d.  Set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding
  2 30 procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term
  2 31 of the project labor agreement.
  2 32    e.  Provide other mechanisms for labor=management cooperation
  2 33 on matters of mutual interest and concern, including but not
  2 34 limited to productivity, quality of work, safety, and health.
  2 35    f.  Fully conform to all applicable state laws and rules.
  3  1    6.  This section shall not be construed to preclude the
  3  2 use of a project labor agreement on any construction project
  3  3 not otherwise subject to this section. This section shall
  3  4 not be construed to require a contractor or subcontractor to
  3  5 enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor
  3  6 organization.
