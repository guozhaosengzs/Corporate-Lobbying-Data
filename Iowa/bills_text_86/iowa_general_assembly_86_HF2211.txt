  9  5 the center to sponsor or support water quality projects that
  9  6 reduce water pollution, including the transport of nutrients
  9  7 to surface water from nonpoint sources. The purpose of the
  9  8 center is to carry out the state's water quality initiative
  9  9 by pursuing a science=based approach to nutrient management
  9 10 research.  Currently, the center is supported by an annual
  9 11 appropriation (see 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, sections 17 and
  9 12 40).
  9 13    CONSERVATION PLANNING CERTIFICATION FOR AGRIBUSINESS
  9 14 PROGRAM.  The bill requires the extension service to
  9 15 develop and administer a conservation planning certification
  9 16 for agribusiness program.  The program is to be based
  9 17 on educational requirements established by NRCS for its
  9 18 certification of conservation planners.  The extension service
  9 19 may establish a fee at an amount determined by the extension
  9 20 service based on the costs of developing and administering the
  9 21 program.  The extension service is entitled to retain fees
  9 22 collected under the program as repayment receipts.

  9 24 FEES.  The bill provides that license and inspection fees paid
  9 25 by persons who manufacture, blend, or distribute fertilizers
  9 26 and soil conditioners and deposited in the general fund for use
  9 27 by DALS in regulating the sale and use of fertilizers and soil
  9 28 conditioners may instead be used by the division to administer
  9 29 water quality projects and programs in high=priority watersheds
  9 30 identified by the WRRC.  The secretary of agriculture may also
  9 31 transfer the moneys to the WQIF.  The bill does not affect
  9 32 fertilizer fees that are required to be deposited into the
  9 33 agriculture management account of the groundwater protection
  9 34 fund.
  9 35    INNOVATIVE PROJECTS == WQIF.  The bill authorizes the
 10  1 division to use moneys available in the WQIF to support
 10  2 grants awarded to persons to support the development of new or
 10  3 improved practices or technologies that reduce the transport of
 10  4 nutrients to surface waters from nonpoint sources.  However,
 10  5 the division cannot award more than $50,000 in grants from the
 10  6 WQIF to support all projects during any fiscal year.
 10  7    DESIGNS FOR QUALIFYING SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
 10  8 PRACTICES.  The bill authorizes a landowner of a district to
 10  9 submit a design for approval by a district for a qualifying
 10 10 voluntary permanent soil conservation practice eligible for
 10 11 cost=share or other forms of available state financing.  The
 10 12 design standards adopted by the division must meet NRCS
 10 13 standards and specifications.  The qualifying practice used in
 10 14 approved designs must be able to be established by a person
 10 15 having a practical knowledge of land use and row crop farming,
 10 16 be relatively inexpensive to establish and maintain, and be
 10 17 highly effective for a long period of time.  The commissioners
 10 18 are not required to provide for the submission of bids unless
 10 19 the division otherwise requires a submission. A landowner is
 10 20 not entitled to receive cost=share or other state financing for
 10 21 preparing or submitting a design.
