  5 25 authorizes the center to award grants to persons to support
  5 26 the development of new or improved practices or technologies
  5 27 that reduce the transport of nutrients to surface waters from
  5 28 nonpoint sources.  However, the center cannot award more than
  5 29 $50,000 in grants to support all projects during any fiscal
  5 30 year.
  5 31    The purpose of the center is to carry out the state's
  5 32 water quality initiative by pursuing a science=based approach
  5 33 to nutrient management research.  Currently, the center is
  5 34 supported by an annual appropriation (see 2015 Iowa Acts, ch.

  6  5 cost=share or other forms of available state financing.  The
  6  6 design standards adopted by the division must meet United
  6  7 States department of agriculture standards and specifications.
  6  8 The qualifying practice used in approved designs must be able
  6  9 to be established by a person having a practical knowledge of
  6 10 land use and row crop farming, be relatively inexpensive to
  6 11 establish and maintain, and be highly effective for a long
  6 12 period of time.  The commissioners are not required to provide
  6 13 for the submission of bids unless the division otherwise
  6 14 requires a submission. A landowner is not entitled to receive
  6 15 cost=share or other state financing for preparing or submitting
  6 16 a design. Persons who construct or establish a qualifying
  6 17 permanent soil and water conservation practice as provided
  6 18 in the bill are not to be construed as being engaged in the
  6 19 practice of engineering.

  6  1 DESIGNS FOR QUALIFYING SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
  6  2 PRACTICES.  The bill authorizes a landowner of a district to
  6  3 submit a design for approval by a district for a qualifying
  6  4 voluntary permanent soil conservation practice eligible for
  6  5 cost=share or other forms of available state financing.  The

  6 22 bill provides that when making funding decisions to improve
  6 23 water quality in watersheds, the department of natural
  6 24 resources and the water resources coordinating council must, in
  6 25 their respective priority evaluations, account for factors that
  6 26 contribute to the watershed's comparative value to the state
  6 27 and local communities located in the watershed.
  6 28    PROPERTY TAX REDUCTION.   The bill provides that property
  6 29 used for soil and water conservation purposes is assessed at
  6 30 10 percent of the actual value established for the property.
  6 31 Property eligible for the reduction in actual value for
  6 32 assessment purposes is limited to a parcel or a segment of
  6 33 a parcel of property that utilizes  a system or practice that
  6 34 reduces the transport of sediment, nutrients, or contaminants
  6 35 to surface water.  The county assessor must require the owner

  5 23 reduce water pollution, including the transport of nutrients
  5 24 to surface water from nonpoint sources. The bill also
  5 25 authorizes the center to award grants to persons to support
  5 26 the development of new or improved practices or technologies
  5 27 that reduce the transport of nutrients to surface waters from
  5 28 nonpoint sources.  However, the center cannot award more than
  5 29 $50,000 in grants to support all projects during any fiscal
  5 30 year.
  5 31    The purpose of the center is to carry out the state's
  5 32 water quality initiative by pursuing a science=based approach
  5 33 to nutrient management research.  Currently, the center is
  5 34 supported by an annual appropriation (see 2015 Iowa Acts, ch.

  6  5 cost=share or other forms of available state financing.  The
  6  6 design standards adopted by the division must meet United
  6  7 States department of agriculture standards and specifications.
  6  8 The qualifying practice used in approved designs must be able
  6  9 to be established by a person having a practical knowledge of
  6 10 land use and row crop farming, be relatively inexpensive to
  6 11 establish and maintain, and be highly effective for a long
