  1 29    1.  a.  A transportation cost supplement program is
  1 30 established to provide additional funding for school districts
  1 31 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed the
  1 32 state average transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts
  1 33 are determined under section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph
  1 34 "c".
  1 35    b.  The board of directors of a school district that
  2  1 satisfies the criteria of paragraph "a", may direct the
  2  2 county commissioner of elections to submit the question of
  2  3 participation in the transportation cost supplement program to
  2  4 the registered voters of the school district at an election
  2  5 held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection 4,
  2  6 paragraph "c".  The question submitted to the voters of the
  2  7 school district shall specify the period of consecutive years
  2  8 that the school district may participate in the program,
  2  9 if otherwise eligible under paragraph "a", not to exceed
  2 10 ten consecutive years.  If a majority of those voting on
  2 11 the question favors participation in the program, the board
  2 12 shall adopt a resolution to participate and shall certify the
  2 13 results of the election to the department of management and the
  2 14 district shall participate in the program.  If a majority of
  2 15 those voting on the question does not favor participation, the
  2 16 district shall not participate in the program.
  2 17    2.  The transportation cost supplement program shall provide
  2 18 additional revenues each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  2 19 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  2 20 the district's average transportation costs per pupil under
  2 21 section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph "c", multiplied by
  2 22 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  2 23 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  2 24 pupil, as those amounts are determined under section 257.31,
  2 25 subsection 17, paragraph "c". However, such resulting amount
  2 26 shall be reduced by the amount of transportation assistance
  2 27 aid received by the district under section 257.31, subsection
  2 28 17, for the same budget year, as defined in section 257.2, if
  2 29 applicable. Certification of a district's participation for a
  2 30 budget year, the method of funding, and the amount to be raised
  2 31 shall be made to the department of management not later than
  2 32 April 15 of the base year, as defined in section 257.2.
  2 33    3.  The transportation cost supplement program shall be
  2 34 funded by either a transportation cost supplement property
  2 35 tax or by the combination of a transportation cost supplement
  3  1 property tax and a transportation cost supplement income
  3  2 surtax.  The method of raising the transportation cost
  3  3 supplement program moneys shall be determined by the board.
  3  4 Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board
  3  5 uses a combination of a transportation property tax and a
  3  6 transportation cost supplement income surtax, the board shall
  3  7 determine the percent of income surtax to be imposed, expressed
  3  8 as full percentage points, not to exceed twenty percent.
  3  9    4.  The department of management shall establish the amount
  3 10 of the transportation cost supplement property tax to be levied
  3 11 or the amount of the combination of the transportation cost
  3 12 supplement property tax to be levied and the amount of the
  3 13 transportation cost supplement income surtax to be imposed for
  3 14 each school year that the transportation cost supplement amount
  3 15 is authorized and the school district eligible under subsection
  3 16 1, paragraph "a".  The transportation cost supplement property
  3 17 tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be
  3 18 levied and imposed, collected, and paid to the school district
  3 19 in the manner provided for the instructional support program in
  3 20 sections 257.21 through 257.26.
  3 21    5.  Revenues received by a school district from a
  3 22 transportation cost supplement property tax or income surtax
  3 23 imposed under this section shall be deposited in the general
  3 24 fund of the school district and expended only for the cost
  3 25 of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school district
  3 26 transportation equipment and school buses, as defined in
  3 27 section 321.1, subsection 69. Revenues received by a school
  3 28 district under this section are miscellaneous income.
  3 29    6.  Except for an adjustment in the total amount authorized
  3 30 to be collected under subsection 2, participation in the
  3 31 transportation cost supplement program under this section shall
  3 32 not affect a school district's eligibility for transportation
  3 33 assistance under section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3 34    7.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the
  3 35 board to use the transportation cost supplement program
  4  1 shall continue, subject to the period of years authorized at
  4  2 election, until the board votes to discontinue the program or
  4  3 the voters of the school district by majority vote order the
  4  4 discontinuance of the program.  The board shall submit at an
  4  5 election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection
  4  6 4, paragraph "c", the question of whether to discontinue the
  4  7 program upon the receipt of a petition signed by not less than
  4  8 one hundred eligible electors or thirty percent of the number
  4  9 of electors voting at the last preceding school election,
  4 10 whichever is greater.
  4 11    8.  Participation in the transportation cost supplement
  4 12 program is not affected by a change in the boundaries of the
  4 13 school district.  If each school district involved in a school
  4 14 reorganization under chapter 275 has approved a transportation
  4 15 cost supplement program, and if the voters have not voted upon
  4 16 the question of participation in the program in the reorganized
  4 17 district, the program shall be in effect for the reorganized
  4 18 district that has been approved for the least amount and the
  4 19 shortest time in any of the districts.
  4 20    Sec. 4.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to school budget
  4 21 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016.
  4 22                           EXPLANATION
  4 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.
  5 32    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  5 33 July 1, 2016.

  1 30 established to provide additional funding for school districts
  1 31 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed the
  1 32 state average transportation costs per pupil, as those amounts
  1 33 are determined under section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph
  1 34 "c".
  1 35    b.  The board of directors of a school district that
  2  1 satisfies the criteria of paragraph "a", may direct the
  2  2 county commissioner of elections to submit the question of
  2  3 participation in the transportation cost supplement program to
  2  4 the registered voters of the school district at an election
  2  5 held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection 4,
  2  6 paragraph "c".  The question submitted to the voters of the
  2  7 school district shall specify the period of consecutive years
  2  8 that the school district may participate in the program,
  2  9 if otherwise eligible under paragraph "a", not to exceed
  2 10 ten consecutive years.  If a majority of those voting on
  2 11 the question favors participation in the program, the board
  2 12 shall adopt a resolution to participate and shall certify the
  2 13 results of the election to the department of management and the
  2 14 district shall participate in the program.  If a majority of
  2 15 those voting on the question does not favor participation, the
  2 16 district shall not participate in the program.
  2 17    2.  The transportation cost supplement program shall provide
  2 18 additional revenues each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  2 19 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  2 20 the district's average transportation costs per pupil under
  2 21 section 257.31, subsection 17, paragraph "c", multiplied by
  2 22 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  2 23 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  2 24 pupil, as those amounts are determined under section 257.31,
  2 25 subsection 17, paragraph "c". However, such resulting amount
  2 26 shall be reduced by the amount of transportation assistance
  2 27 aid received by the district under section 257.31, subsection
  2 28 17, for the same budget year, as defined in section 257.2, if
  2 29 applicable. Certification of a district's participation for a
  2 30 budget year, the method of funding, and the amount to be raised
  2 31 shall be made to the department of management not later than
  2 32 April 15 of the base year, as defined in section 257.2.
  2 33    3.  The transportation cost supplement program shall be
  2 34 funded by either a transportation cost supplement property
  2 35 tax or by the combination of a transportation cost supplement
  3  1 property tax and a transportation cost supplement income
  3  2 surtax.  The method of raising the transportation cost
  3  3 supplement program moneys shall be determined by the board.
  3  4 Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board
  3  5 uses a combination of a transportation property tax and a
  3  6 transportation cost supplement income surtax, the board shall
  3  7 determine the percent of income surtax to be imposed, expressed
  3  8 as full percentage points, not to exceed twenty percent.
  3  9    4.  The department of management shall establish the amount
  3 10 of the transportation cost supplement property tax to be levied
  3 11 or the amount of the combination of the transportation cost
  3 12 supplement property tax to be levied and the amount of the
  3 13 transportation cost supplement income surtax to be imposed for
  3 14 each school year that the transportation cost supplement amount
  3 15 is authorized and the school district eligible under subsection
  3 16 1, paragraph "a".  The transportation cost supplement property
  3 17 tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be
  3 18 levied and imposed, collected, and paid to the school district
  3 19 in the manner provided for the instructional support program in
  3 20 sections 257.21 through 257.26.
  3 21    5.  Revenues received by a school district from a
  3 22 transportation cost supplement property tax or income surtax
  3 23 imposed under this section shall be deposited in the general
  3 24 fund of the school district and expended only for the cost
  3 25 of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school district
  3 26 transportation equipment and school buses, as defined in
  3 27 section 321.1, subsection 69. Revenues received by a school
  3 28 district under this section are miscellaneous income.
  3 29    6.  Except for an adjustment in the total amount authorized
  3 30 to be collected under subsection 2, participation in the
  3 31 transportation cost supplement program under this section shall
  3 32 not affect a school district's eligibility for transportation
  3 33 assistance under section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3 34    7.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the
  3 35 board to use the transportation cost supplement program
  4  1 shall continue, subject to the period of years authorized at
  4  2 election, until the board votes to discontinue the program or
  4  3 the voters of the school district by majority vote order the
  4  4 discontinuance of the program.  The board shall submit at an
  4  5 election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection
  4  6 4, paragraph "c", the question of whether to discontinue the
  4  7 program upon the receipt of a petition signed by not less than
  4  8 one hundred eligible electors or thirty percent of the number
  4  9 of electors voting at the last preceding school election,
  4 10 whichever is greater.
  4 11    8.  Participation in the transportation cost supplement
  4 12 program is not affected by a change in the boundaries of the
  4 13 school district.  If each school district involved in a school
  4 14 reorganization under chapter 275 has approved a transportation
  4 15 cost supplement program, and if the voters have not voted upon
  4 16 the question of participation in the program in the reorganized
  4 17 district, the program shall be in effect for the reorganized
  4 18 district that has been approved for the least amount and the
  4 19 shortest time in any of the districts.

  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code

  4 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.

  3  3 supplement program moneys shall be determined by the board.
  3  4 Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board

  3 14 each school year that the transportation cost supplement amount
  3 15 is authorized and the school district eligible under subsection
  3 16 1, paragraph "a".  The transportation cost supplement property
  3 17 tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be

  3 19 in the manner provided for the instructional support program in

  4 21 years beginning on or after July 1, 2016.
  4 22                           EXPLANATION
  4 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.
  5 32    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
  5 33 July 1, 2016.

  2 22 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  2 23 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  2 24 pupil, as those amounts are determined under section 257.31,
  2 25 subsection 17, paragraph "c". However, such resulting amount
  2 26 shall be reduced by the amount of transportation assistance
  2 27 aid received by the district under section 257.31, subsection
  2 28 17, for the same budget year, as defined in section 257.2, if
  2 29 applicable. Certification of a district's participation for a
  2 30 budget year, the method of funding, and the amount to be raised
  2 31 shall be made to the department of management not later than
  2 32 April 15 of the base year, as defined in section 257.2.
  2 33    3.  The transportation cost supplement program shall be
  2 34 funded by either a transportation cost supplement property
  2 35 tax or by the combination of a transportation cost supplement
  3  1 property tax and a transportation cost supplement income
  3  2 surtax.  The method of raising the transportation cost
  3  3 supplement program moneys shall be determined by the board.
  3  4 Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board
  3  5 uses a combination of a transportation property tax and a
  3  6 transportation cost supplement income surtax, the board shall
  3  7 determine the percent of income surtax to be imposed, expressed
  3  8 as full percentage points, not to exceed twenty percent.
  3  9    4.  The department of management shall establish the amount
  3 10 of the transportation cost supplement property tax to be levied
  3 11 or the amount of the combination of the transportation cost
  3 12 supplement property tax to be levied and the amount of the
  3 13 transportation cost supplement income surtax to be imposed for
  3 14 each school year that the transportation cost supplement amount
  3 15 is authorized and the school district eligible under subsection
  3 16 1, paragraph "a".  The transportation cost supplement property
  3 17 tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be
  3 18 levied and imposed, collected, and paid to the school district
  3 19 in the manner provided for the instructional support program in
  3 20 sections 257.21 through 257.26.
  3 21    5.  Revenues received by a school district from a
  3 22 transportation cost supplement property tax or income surtax
  3 23 imposed under this section shall be deposited in the general
  3 24 fund of the school district and expended only for the cost
  3 25 of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school district
  3 26 transportation equipment and school buses, as defined in
  3 27 section 321.1, subsection 69. Revenues received by a school
  3 28 district under this section are miscellaneous income.
  3 29    6.  Except for an adjustment in the total amount authorized
  3 30 to be collected under subsection 2, participation in the
  3 31 transportation cost supplement program under this section shall
  3 32 not affect a school district's eligibility for transportation
  3 33 assistance under section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3 34    7.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the
  3 35 board to use the transportation cost supplement program
  4  1 shall continue, subject to the period of years authorized at
  4  2 election, until the board votes to discontinue the program or
  4  3 the voters of the school district by majority vote order the
  4  4 discontinuance of the program.  The board shall submit at an
  4  5 election held on a date specified in section 39.2, subsection
  4  6 4, paragraph "c", the question of whether to discontinue the
  4  7 program upon the receipt of a petition signed by not less than
  4  8 one hundred eligible electors or thirty percent of the number
  4  9 of electors voting at the last preceding school election,
  4 10 whichever is greater.
  4 11    8.  Participation in the transportation cost supplement
  4 12 program is not affected by a change in the boundaries of the
  4 13 school district.  If each school district involved in a school
  4 14 reorganization under chapter 275 has approved a transportation
  4 15 cost supplement program, and if the voters have not voted upon
  4 16 the question of participation in the program in the reorganized
  4 17 district, the program shall be in effect for the reorganized
  4 18 district that has been approved for the least amount and the
  4 19 shortest time in any of the districts.

  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement

  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be

  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.

  4 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under

  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.

  4 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.

  2 26 shall be reduced by the amount of transportation assistance
  2 27 aid received by the district under section 257.31, subsection
  2 28 17, for the same budget year, as defined in section 257.2, if
  2 29 applicable. Certification of a district's participation for a

  2 31 shall be made to the department of management not later than
  2 32 April 15 of the base year, as defined in section 257.2.
  2 33    3.  The transportation cost supplement program shall be
  2 34 funded by either a transportation cost supplement property
  2 35 tax or by the combination of a transportation cost supplement
  3  1 property tax and a transportation cost supplement income
  3  2 surtax.  The method of raising the transportation cost
  3  3 supplement program moneys shall be determined by the board.
  3  4 Subject to the limitation in section 298.14, if the board
  3  5 uses a combination of a transportation property tax and a
  3  6 transportation cost supplement income surtax, the board shall
  3  7 determine the percent of income surtax to be imposed, expressed
  3  8 as full percentage points, not to exceed twenty percent.
  3  9    4.  The department of management shall establish the amount
  3 10 of the transportation cost supplement property tax to be levied
  3 11 or the amount of the combination of the transportation cost
  3 12 supplement property tax to be levied and the amount of the
  3 13 transportation cost supplement income surtax to be imposed for
  3 14 each school year that the transportation cost supplement amount
  3 15 is authorized and the school district eligible under subsection
  3 16 1, paragraph "a".  The transportation cost supplement property
  3 17 tax and income surtax, if an income surtax is imposed, shall be
  3 18 levied and imposed, collected, and paid to the school district
  3 19 in the manner provided for the instructional support program in
  3 20 sections 257.21 through 257.26.
  3 21    5.  Revenues received by a school district from a
  3 22 transportation cost supplement property tax or income surtax
  3 23 imposed under this section shall be deposited in the general
  3 24 fund of the school district and expended only for the cost
  3 25 of repairing, maintaining, and fueling school district
  3 26 transportation equipment and school buses, as defined in
  3 27 section 321.1, subsection 69. Revenues received by a school
  3 28 district under this section are miscellaneous income.
  3 29    6.  Except for an adjustment in the total amount authorized
  3 30 to be collected under subsection 2, participation in the
  3 31 transportation cost supplement program under this section shall
  3 32 not affect a school district's eligibility for transportation
  3 33 assistance under section 257.31, subsection 17.
  3 34    7.  Once approved at an election, the authority of the
  3 35 board to use the transportation cost supplement program
  4  1 shall continue, subject to the period of years authorized at
  4  2 election, until the board votes to discontinue the program or
  4  3 the voters of the school district by majority vote order the
  4  4 discontinuance of the program.  The board shall submit at an

  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the

  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under

  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement

  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.

  4 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 25    This bill establishes a transportation cost supplement
  4 26 program to provide additional funding for school districts
  4 27 in which the district transportation costs per pupil exceed
  4 28 the state average transportation costs per pupil. Under the
  4 29 bill, the board of directors of such a school district may
  4 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
  4 31 question of participation in the program to the registered
  4 32 voters of the school district. The question submitted to the
  4 33 voters shall specify the period of consecutive years that the
  4 34 school district may participate in the program not to exceed 10
  4 35 consecutive years.
  5  1 The transportation cost supplement program provides
  5  2 additional revenue each fiscal year not to exceed an amount
  5  3 equal to the district's actual enrollment used to calculate
  5  4 the district's average transportation costs, multiplied by
  5  5 the remainder of the district's average transportation costs
  5  6 per pupil minus the state average transportation costs per
  5  7 pupil. This amount is required to be reduced by the amount of
  5  8 transportation assistance aid received by the district under
  5  9 current Code section 257.31(17), if any, for the same budget
  5 10 year.
  5 11    The bill authorizes the transportation cost supplement
  5 12 program to be funded by either a transportation cost supplement
  5 13 property tax or by the combination of a transportation cost
  5 14 supplement property tax and a transportation cost supplement
  5 15 income surtax.  An income surtax imposed as part of the
  5 16 transportation cost supplement program is subject to the 20
  5 17 percent cumulative income surtax cap under Code section 298.14.
  5 18    Revenues received by a school district from a transportation
  5 19 cost supplement property tax or income surtax shall be
  5 20 deposited in the general fund of the school district and
  5 21 expended only for the cost of repairing, maintaining, and
  5 22 fueling school district transportation equipment and school
  5 23 buses, as defined in Code section 321.1(69). Revenues received
  5 24 by a school district under this section are miscellaneous
  5 25 income.
  5 26    The bill provides that the transportation cost supplement
  5 27 program may be discontinued by either school board action or
  5 28 by petition and election and includes provisions relating to
  5 29 participation in the transportation cost supplement program by
  5 30 school districts involved in a school reorganization under Code
  5 31 chapter 275.
  5 32    The bill applies to school budget years beginning on or after
