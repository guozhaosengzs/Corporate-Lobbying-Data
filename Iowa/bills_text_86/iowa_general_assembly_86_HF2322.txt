  2 30 of this section.
  2 31    Sec. 3.  TRANSITION AND WAIVER PROVISION.
  2 32    1.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 123.151,
  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated
  3  3 dispensing device subject to the conditions provided in the
  3  4 waiver until September 30, 2016.
  3  5    2.  A licensee or permittee who had applied for and
  3  6 was denied a waiver to dispense wine or beer through an
  3  7 automated dispensing device prior to January 1, 2016, may
  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated
  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee
  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being
  3 16 deactivated prior to January 1, 2016, and designates, in the
  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  3  6 was denied a waiver to dispense wine or beer through an
  3  7 automated dispensing device prior to January 1, 2016, may
  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated
  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee

  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to

  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote

  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed

  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or

  2 31    Sec. 3.  TRANSITION AND WAIVER PROVISION.
  2 32    1.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 123.151,
  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated
  3  3 dispensing device subject to the conditions provided in the

  3  7 automated dispensing device prior to January 1, 2016, may
  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated

  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated

  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated

  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated

  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated

  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being
  3 16 deactivated prior to January 1, 2016, and designates, in the
  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,

  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under

  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to

  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The

  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.

  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote

  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator

  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under

  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  2 31    Sec. 3.  TRANSITION AND WAIVER PROVISION.
  2 32    1.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 123.151,
  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver

  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated
  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee
  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being

  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  2 31    Sec. 3.  TRANSITION AND WAIVER PROVISION.
  2 32    1.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 123.151,
  2 33 as enacted by this Act, to the contrary, a liquor control
  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated
  3  3 dispensing device subject to the conditions provided in the
  3  4 waiver until September 30, 2016.
  3  5    2.  A licensee or permittee who had applied for and
  3  6 was denied a waiver to dispense wine or beer through an
  3  7 automated dispensing device prior to January 1, 2016, may
  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated
  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee
  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being
  3 16 deactivated prior to January 1, 2016, and designates, in the
  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  2  5 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee deactivate the
  2  6 automated dispensing device and any associated component

  2  9    c.  A requirement that the authorized liquor control
  2 10 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee control and limit
  2 11 the amount of beer, wine, or spirits dispensed by the automated
  2 12 dispensing device in a single transaction.
  2 13    d.  A requirement that the authorized liquor control

  2 26 the division may rescind the privilege granted a liquor control
  2 27 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee to allow patrons to

  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated
  3  3 dispensing device subject to the conditions provided in the

  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding

  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated
  3 13 component designed to grant access to the device be deactivated
  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee
  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being
  3 16 deactivated prior to January 1, 2016, and designates, in the
  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and

  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  3 14 at the end of each business day, if the licensee or permittee
  3 15 acquired the automated dispensing device incapable of being
  3 16 deactivated prior to January 1, 2016, and designates, in the
  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant

  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The

  2 34 licensee, beer permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver
  2 35 to dispense wine or beer through an automated dispensing
  3  1 device as of the effective date of this Act shall be permitted
  3  2 to continue to dispense wine or beer through an automated
  3  3 dispensing device subject to the conditions provided in the
  3  4 waiver until September 30, 2016.
  3  5    2.  A licensee or permittee who had applied for and

  3  8 apply for and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine,
  3  9 or spirits through an automated dispensing device pursuant
  3 10 to section 123.151, as enacted by this Act, notwithstanding
  3 11 the requirement in section 123.151, subsection 4, paragraph
  3 12 "b", that the automated dispensing device and any associated

  3 17 application, that the automated dispensing device is the device
  3 18 that will be used to dispense beer, wine, or spirits pursuant
  3 19 to the privilege, if granted.  If the licensee or permittee
  3 20 replaces or ceases to use the automated dispensing device
  3 21 that is incapable of being deactivated, the authority of the
  3 22 alcoholic beverages division of the department of commerce to
  3 23 grant the licensee or permittee the privilege pursuant to this
  3 24 subsection 2 shall cease and the licensee or permittee shall be
  3 25 required to comply with all the requirements of section 123.151
  3 26 to be granted the privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits
  3 27 through an automated dispensing device.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,
  5  6 as provided by the bill.

  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor

  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed

  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages

  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed

  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The

  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote

  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to

  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages

  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
  5  4 the end of the business day may have this requirement waived
  5  5 and be granted a privilege to dispense beer, wine, or spirits,

  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of

  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under

  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient

  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.

  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill authorizes certain liquor control licensees,
  3 32 beer permittees, and wine permittees to allow patrons to
  3 33 serve themselves wine, beer, or spirits through an automated
  3 34 dispensing device.
  3 35    Code section 123.3 (definitions) is amended to define an
  4  1 "automated dispensing device" as any mechanized device capable
  4  2 of dispensing beer, wine, or spirits directly or by remote
  4  3 activation to a patron by the licensee or permittee.
  4  4    New Code section 123.151 authorizes the administrator
  4  5 of the alcoholic beverages division of the department of
  4  6 commerce to grant the privilege of dispensing wine, beer,
  4  7 or spirits through an automated dispensing device to liquor
  4  8 control licensees, beer permittees, and wine permittees under
  4  9 certain conditions.  The privilege, which shall be noted on
  4 10 the applicable liquor control license or permit, shall only
  4 11 be granted to holders of a license or permit authorized to
  4 12 sell beer, wine, or spirits for consumption on the licensed
  4 13 premises.  The bill directs the alcoholic beverages division to
  4 14 adopt rules requiring the applicable liquor control licensee,
  4 15 beer permittee, or wine permittee to activate the device and
  4 16 any component designed to grant access to the device before
  4 17 a patron independently dispenses beer, wine, or spirits, to
  4 18 deactivate the device at the end of each business day, to
  4 19 limit the amount of wine, beer, or spirits dispensed in a
  4 20 single transaction, and to exercise care and employ sufficient
  4 21 persons to ensure that only persons of legal age may obtain
  4 22 beer, wine, or spirits from the device and that a patron served
  4 23 beer, wine, or spirits through an automated dispensing device
  4 24 is not intoxicated.  The bill grants the alcoholic beverages
  4 25 division the authority to rescind the automated dispensing
  4 26 device privilege for failure to comply with the requirements of
  4 27 this new section.
  4 28    The bill includes a transition and waiver provision. The
  4 29 transition provision allows a liquor control licensee, beer
  4 30 permittee, or wine permittee granted a waiver to dispense
  4 31 wine or beer through an automated dispensing device as of the
  4 32 effective date of the bill to continue to dispense wine or
  4 33 beer through an automated dispensing device subject to the
  4 34 conditions provided in the waiver until September 30, 2016.
  4 35 The waiver provision provides that a licensee or permittee that
  5  1 had applied for and been denied a waiver to dispense wine or
  5  2 beer through an automated dispensing device prior to January 1,
  5  3 2016, because the device was incapable of being deactivated at
