 10 10 fostering academic achievement for all students by focusing
 10 11 on prevention, intervention, support, and recovery efforts to
 10 12 develop and maintain safe and supportive schools. The office
 10 13 shall be responsible for coordination of state and department
 10 14 efforts to facilitate positive school climates in public and
 10 15 accredited nonpublic schools. The office shall solicit input
 10 16 from social media experts in implementing the bill.
 10 17    The bill provides duties of the office, including compiling
 10 18 and making available to schools evidence=based practices
 10 19 and resources to develop and maintain safe and supportive
 10 20 schools, establishing and maintaining a central repository
 10 21 for collecting and analyzing information about bullying, and
 10 22 assisting schools to develop strategies and techniques for
 10 23 effectively communicating with and engaging parents in efforts
 10 24 to protect and deter students from bullying.
 10 25    The bill directs the school climate technical assistance
 10 26 office, at the direction of the director of the department
 10 27 of education, to establish a school climate and bullying
 10 28 advisory committee. The advisory committee shall enhance

 10 33 community groups, and organizations. The bill provides for
 10 34 the voting membership of the committee and for nonvoting
 10 35 legislative members.
 11  1 The advisory committee shall provide research and make
 11  2 recommendations to school districts and accredited nonpublic
 11  3 schools regarding best practices to improve school climate

 11 17 state antibullying law.
 11 18    The bill strikes the current definition of "harassment" and
 11 19 "bullying" and provides instead a definition of "bullying".
 11 20 The bill strikes references to harassment in Code section
 11 21 280.28. The bill defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive
 11 22 behavior toward another student who is not a sibling, which
 11 23 involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, which is
 11 24 repeated or is likely to be repeated, which is based on any
 11 25 actual or perceived trait or characteristic of the student
 11 26 or any other reason, and which meets one or more of certain
 11 27 conditions. The bill specifies that bullying may include but
 11 28 is not limited to making threats, spreading rumors, attacking
 11 29 a student physically or verbally, or intentionally excluding
 11 30 a student from a group. The bill defines "power imbalance"
 11 31 as the use of power, including but not limited to physical
 11 32 strength, access to embarrassing information, or social
 11 33 popularity, to control or harm another student. The bill

 11 35 over time and in different situations.
 12  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" by adding
 12  2 any other electronic communication site, device, or means to
 12  3 the definition and by including social networking sites as part
 12  4 of the term "internet=based communications".
 12  5    The bill requires the board of directors of a school district
 12  6 and the authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic
 12  7 school to update the district's or school's antibullying policy
 12  8 on or before January 1, 2016.
 12  9    The bill requires such policies to include a procedure for
 12 10 a school employee, volunteer, student, parent or guardian,
 12 11 or any other person to report an act of bullying, including
 12 12 the identification by job title of the school official
 12 13 responsible for ensuring that the policy is implemented, and
 12 14 the identification of the person or persons responsible for
 12 15 receiving and investigating reports of bullying. The procedure
 12 16 must include a process to submit a report anonymously and with
 12 17 protection from retaliation.
 12 18    The bill requires that such policies include a requirement
 12 19 that a school employee report in a timely and responsive manner
 12 20 any act of bullying that the school employee witnesses or is
 12 21 aware of to the school official responsible for receiving
 12 22 reports of bullying.
 12 23    The bill requires school districts and accredited nonpublic
 12 24 schools, to the extent that funds are available, to develop a
 12 25 process to provide school employees, volunteers, and students
 12 26 with the skills and knowledge, based on research=based best
 12 27 practices, to help reduce incidents of bullying. Such training
 12 28 shall include but not be limited to training based on the needs
 12 29 identified by the data analysis and survey required by Code
 12 30 section 280.28, subsection 6.
 12 31    Current law requires the board of directors of a school
 12 32 district and the authorities in charge of each nonpublic school
 12 33 to develop and maintain a system to collect bullying incidence
 12 34 data. The bill requires the board and the authorities to
 12 35 analyze the data and to survey school employees, volunteers,
 13  1 students, and parents or guardians to identify professional
 13  2 development and training needs relating to the school's
 13  3 antibullying policy.
 13  4    The bill provides that each school district and accredited
 13  5 nonpublic school shall have the authority and responsibility
 13  6 to impose reasonable and educationally based discipline,
 13  7 consistent with a student's constitutional rights, for bullying

 12  8 on or before January 1, 2016.

 11 28 is not limited to making threats, spreading rumors, attacking
 11 29 a student physically or verbally, or intentionally excluding
 11 30 a student from a group. The bill defines "power imbalance"
 11 31 as the use of power, including but not limited to physical
