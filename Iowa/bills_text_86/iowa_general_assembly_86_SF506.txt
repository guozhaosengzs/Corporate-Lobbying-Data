  7 34 478.15, and 478.33 are applicable to petitions for franchise
  7 35 filed on or after November 1, 2014, that have not been acted
  8  1 upon by the utilities board on the effective date of this Act
  8  2 and to petitions for franchise filed on or after the effective
  8  3 date of this Act.
  8  4    2.  The sections of this Act amending sections 479B.9,
  8  5 479B.13, 479B.16, 479B.24, and 479B.30 are applicable to
  8  6 applications for permits filed on or after November 1, 2014,
  8  7 that have not been acted upon by the utilities board on the
  8  8 effective date of this Act and to applications for permits
  8  9 filed on or after the effective date of this Act.
  8 10                           EXPLANATION
  8 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 13    This bill relates to the construction, erection,
  8 14 maintenance, or operation of electric transmission lines and
  8 15 hazardous liquid pipelines.
  8 16    The bill primarily applies to petitioners for an electric
  8 17 transmission franchise that are not a public utility as
  8 18 defined in Code section 476.1 furnishing gas or electricity
  8 19 to the public for compensation, a rural electric cooperative,
  8 20 or a municipal utility, and to applicants for a permit to
  8 21 construct a pipeline for crude oil.  In both cases, in order
  8 22 to obtain a franchise or a permit the Iowa utilities board
  8 23 is required to make a finding that the proposed transmission
  8 24 line or crude oil pipeline is recommended in the most recent
  8 25 annual report prepared by the economic development authority
  8 26 pursuant to Code section 473.15. That report assesses the
  8 27 progress of state agencies in implementing energy management
  8 28 improvements, alternative and renewable energy systems, and
  8 29 life cycle cost analyses under  Code chapter 470, and on the use
  8 30 of renewable fuels. The report also provides an assessment of
  8 31 the economic and environmental impact of the progress made by
  8 32 state agencies related to energy management and alternative and
  8 33 renewable energy, along with recommendations on technological
  8 34 opportunities and policies necessary for continued improvement
  8 35 in these areas.
  9  1 The bill provides that in order to be granted eminent
  9  2 domain authority (power of condemnation), an applicant for a
  9  3 franchise (electric transmission lines) or permit (hazardous
  9  4 liquid pipelines) must obtain through voluntary easements 75
  9  5 percent or more of the land needed, and that if an applicant
  9  6 is vested with the right of eminent domain, the board may
  9  7 order the applicant to pay reasonable attorney fees to ensure
  9  8 a private owner of land access to legal counsel, and upon
  9  9 conclusion of the eminent domain proceedings to pay all costs
  9 10 of the assessment, attorney fees and costs, and the cost of one
  9 11 appraisal if the award exceeds 100 percent of the final offer
  9 12 made by the applicant.
  9 13    Further, in the event of a complaint that an applicant has
  9 14 violated provisions permitting an owner of land to cancel any
  9 15 agreement granting an easement or other interest, the applicant
  9 16 will be subject to the investigation provisions in current law
  9 17 that can lead to a formal proceeding by the Iowa utilities
  9 18 board.
  9 19    Additionally, with reference to an application for a permit
  9 20 for a crude oil pipeline, the surety bond requirement is
  9 21 increased from $250,000 to $500,000.
  9 22    Finally, with reference to any applicant under Code
  9 23 chapter 479B (hazardous liquid pipelines), the bill deletes a
  9 24 requirement that a landowner shall pay  commissioner assessment
  9 25 costs and reasonable attorney fees and other costs in a
  9 26 proceeding in response to a petition for the determination of
  9 27 construction damages if costs awarded to the landowner do not
  9 28 exceed 110 percent.
  9 29    The bill takes effect upon enactment and is retroactively
  9 30 applicable to November 1, 2014, for petitions for franchise
  9 31 under Code chapter 478 and applications for permits under
  9 32 Code chapter 479B that have not been acted upon by the Iowa
  9 33 utilities board on the effective date of the bill and to
  9 34 petitions and permits filed on or after the bill's effective
  9 35 date.

  7 23 shall receive a per diem of fifty dollars and actual and

  7 25 official duties. The pipeline company shall also pay all costs
  7 26 occasioned by the appeal, including reasonable attorney fees
  7 27 to be taxed by the court, unless on the trial of the appeal the
  7 28 same or a lesser amount of damages is awarded than was allowed

  8  7 that have not been acted upon by the utilities board on the
  8  8 effective date of this Act and to applications for permits

  8 23 is required to make a finding that the proposed transmission
  8 24 line or crude oil pipeline is recommended in the most recent
  8 25 annual report prepared by the economic development authority
  8 26 pursuant to Code section 473.15. That report assesses the

  8 28 improvements, alternative and renewable energy systems, and
  8 29 life cycle cost analyses under  Code chapter 470, and on the use

  9  6 is vested with the right of eminent domain, the board may
  9  7 order the applicant to pay reasonable attorney fees to ensure
  9  8 a private owner of land access to legal counsel, and upon
  9  9 conclusion of the eminent domain proceedings to pay all costs
  9 10 of the assessment, attorney fees and costs, and the cost of one
  9 11 appraisal if the award exceeds 100 percent of the final offer
  9 12 made by the applicant.

  9 10 of the assessment, attorney fees and costs, and the cost of one

  9 13    Further, in the event of a complaint that an applicant has
  9 14 violated provisions permitting an owner of land to cancel any
  9 15 agreement granting an easement or other interest, the applicant
  9 16 will be subject to the investigation provisions in current law

  8 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 13    This bill relates to the construction, erection,
  8 14 maintenance, or operation of electric transmission lines and
  8 15 hazardous liquid pipelines.
  8 16    The bill primarily applies to petitioners for an electric
  8 17 transmission franchise that are not a public utility as
  8 18 defined in Code section 476.1 furnishing gas or electricity
  8 19 to the public for compensation, a rural electric cooperative,
  8 20 or a municipal utility, and to applicants for a permit to
  8 21 construct a pipeline for crude oil.  In both cases, in order
  8 22 to obtain a franchise or a permit the Iowa utilities board
  8 23 is required to make a finding that the proposed transmission
  8 24 line or crude oil pipeline is recommended in the most recent
  8 25 annual report prepared by the economic development authority
  8 26 pursuant to Code section 473.15. That report assesses the
  8 27 progress of state agencies in implementing energy management
  8 28 improvements, alternative and renewable energy systems, and
  8 29 life cycle cost analyses under  Code chapter 470, and on the use
  8 30 of renewable fuels. The report also provides an assessment of
  8 31 the economic and environmental impact of the progress made by
  8 32 state agencies related to energy management and alternative and
  8 33 renewable energy, along with recommendations on technological
  8 34 opportunities and policies necessary for continued improvement
  8 35 in these areas.
  9  1 The bill provides that in order to be granted eminent
  9  2 domain authority (power of condemnation), an applicant for a
  9  3 franchise (electric transmission lines) or permit (hazardous
  9  4 liquid pipelines) must obtain through voluntary easements 75
  9  5 percent or more of the land needed, and that if an applicant
  9  6 is vested with the right of eminent domain, the board may
  9  7 order the applicant to pay reasonable attorney fees to ensure
  9  8 a private owner of land access to legal counsel, and upon
  9  9 conclusion of the eminent domain proceedings to pay all costs
  9 10 of the assessment, attorney fees and costs, and the cost of one
  9 11 appraisal if the award exceeds 100 percent of the final offer
  9 12 made by the applicant.
  9 13    Further, in the event of a complaint that an applicant has
  9 14 violated provisions permitting an owner of land to cancel any
  9 15 agreement granting an easement or other interest, the applicant
  9 16 will be subject to the investigation provisions in current law
  9 17 that can lead to a formal proceeding by the Iowa utilities
  9 18 board.
  9 19    Additionally, with reference to an application for a permit
  9 20 for a crude oil pipeline, the surety bond requirement is
  9 21 increased from $250,000 to $500,000.

  8 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 13    This bill relates to the construction, erection,
  8 14 maintenance, or operation of electric transmission lines and
  8 15 hazardous liquid pipelines.
  8 16    The bill primarily applies to petitioners for an electric
  8 17 transmission franchise that are not a public utility as
  8 18 defined in Code section 476.1 furnishing gas or electricity
  8 19 to the public for compensation, a rural electric cooperative,
  8 20 or a municipal utility, and to applicants for a permit to
  8 21 construct a pipeline for crude oil.  In both cases, in order
  8 22 to obtain a franchise or a permit the Iowa utilities board
  8 23 is required to make a finding that the proposed transmission
  8 24 line or crude oil pipeline is recommended in the most recent
  8 25 annual report prepared by the economic development authority
  8 26 pursuant to Code section 473.15. That report assesses the
  8 27 progress of state agencies in implementing energy management
  8 28 improvements, alternative and renewable energy systems, and
  8 29 life cycle cost analyses under  Code chapter 470, and on the use
  8 30 of renewable fuels. The report also provides an assessment of
  8 31 the economic and environmental impact of the progress made by
  8 32 state agencies related to energy management and alternative and
  8 33 renewable energy, along with recommendations on technological
  8 34 opportunities and policies necessary for continued improvement
  8 35 in these areas.
  9  1 The bill provides that in order to be granted eminent
  9  2 domain authority (power of condemnation), an applicant for a
  9  3 franchise (electric transmission lines) or permit (hazardous
  9  4 liquid pipelines) must obtain through voluntary easements 75
  9  5 percent or more of the land needed, and that if an applicant
  9  6 is vested with the right of eminent domain, the board may
  9  7 order the applicant to pay reasonable attorney fees to ensure
  9  8 a private owner of land access to legal counsel, and upon
  9  9 conclusion of the eminent domain proceedings to pay all costs
  9 10 of the assessment, attorney fees and costs, and the cost of one
  9 11 appraisal if the award exceeds 100 percent of the final offer
  9 12 made by the applicant.
  9 13    Further, in the event of a complaint that an applicant has
  9 14 violated provisions permitting an owner of land to cancel any
  9 15 agreement granting an easement or other interest, the applicant
  9 16 will be subject to the investigation provisions in current law
  9 17 that can lead to a formal proceeding by the Iowa utilities
  9 18 board.
  9 19    Additionally, with reference to an application for a permit
  9 20 for a crude oil pipeline, the surety bond requirement is
  9 21 increased from $250,000 to $500,000.
  9 22    Finally, with reference to any applicant under Code
  9 23 chapter 479B (hazardous liquid pipelines), the bill deletes a
  9 24 requirement that a landowner shall pay  commissioner assessment
  9 25 costs and reasonable attorney fees and other costs in a
