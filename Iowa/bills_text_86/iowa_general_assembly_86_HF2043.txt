  1  7    a.  "Certification" means the participation and assent of
  1  8 the chief law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction where the
  1  9 applicant resides or maintains an address of record, that is
  1 10 necessary under federal law for the approval of an application
  1 11 to make or transfer a firearm suppressor.
  1 12    b.  "Chief law enforcement officer" means the county sheriff,
  1 13 chief of police, or the designee of such official, that the

  1 16 determined is otherwise eligible to provide any required
  1 17 certification for making or transferring a firearm suppressor.
  1 18    c.  "Firearm suppressor" means a mechanical device
  1 19 specifically constructed and designed so that when attached to
  1 20 a firearm it silences, muffles, or suppresses the sound when
  1 21 fired and that is considered a "firearm silencer" or "firearm
  1 22 muffler" as defined in 18 U.S.C. {921.
  1 23    2.  a.  A chief law enforcement officer is not required
  1 24 to make any certification under this section the chief law
  1 25 enforcement officer knows to be false, but the chief law
  1 26 enforcement officer shall not refuse, based on a generalized
  1 27 objection, to issue a certification to make or transfer a

  2 35 an arrest or proceeding relevant to the eligibility of the
  3  1 applicant to lawfully possess or receive a firearm suppressor.

  3  3 or consent to inspect any private premises as a condition of

  3 17                           EXPLANATION
  3 18 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 20    This bill relates to the possession and transferring of
  3 21 firearm suppressors.
  3 22    FIREARM SUPPRESSORS.  Current Iowa law provides that a
  3 23 mechanical device specifically constructed and designed so that
  3 24 when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or suppresses
  3 25 the sound when fired is an offensive weapon.  Under Code
  3 26 section 724.3, any person who knowingly possesses an offensive
  3 27 weapon commits a class "D" felony, punishable by confinement
  3 28 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
  3 29 more than $7,500.
  3 30    The bill strikes a provision in Code section 724.1(1)(h)
  3 31 that classifies a firearm suppressor as an offensive weapon.
  3 32 By striking this provision, a firearm suppressor is legal to
  3 33 possess in the state.
  3 34    The bill also creates in new Code section 724.1A, a process
  3 35 whereby a person may apply to the chief law enforcement officer
  4  1 of the jurisdiction where the person resides or maintains an
  4  2 address of record for a certification to make or transfer a
  4  3 firearm suppressor.  The bill defines "firearm suppressor" to
  4  4 mean a mechanical device specifically constructed and designed
  4  5 so that when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or
  4  6 suppresses the sound when fired and that is considered a
  4  7 "firearm silencer" or "firearm muffler" as defined in 18 U.S.C.
  4  8 {921.
  4  9    The bill specifies that a chief law enforcement officer
  4 10 shall not refuse to provide certification, based on a
  4 11 generalized objection, to an applicant requesting to make
  4 12 or transfer a firearm suppressor.  If a person applies for
  4 13 certification to make or transfer a firearm suppressor with
  4 14 the chief law enforcement officer, the bill requires the chief
  4 15 law enforcement officer to issue the certification within 30
  4 16 days of receiving such an application unless the applicant
  4 17 is prohibited by law from making or transferring a firearm
  4 18 suppressor or the applicant is the subject of a proceeding that
  4 19 could result in the applicant being prohibited by law from
  4 20 making or transferring a firearm suppressor.  If the chief
  4 21 law enforcement officer does not issue a certification under
  4 22 the bill, the chief law enforcement officer shall provide the
  4 23 applicant a written notification of the denial and the reason
  4 24 for the denial.  If the certification has been approved by the
  4 25 chief law enforcement officer under the bill, the applicant
  4 26 has the authority to make or transfer a firearm suppressor as
  4 27 provided by state and federal law.
  4 28    If the applicant's request for certification is denied,

  3 20    This bill relates to the possession and transferring of
  3 21 firearm suppressors.
  3 22    FIREARM SUPPRESSORS.  Current Iowa law provides that a
  3 23 mechanical device specifically constructed and designed so that
  3 24 when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or suppresses
  3 25 the sound when fired is an offensive weapon.  Under Code
  3 26 section 724.3, any person who knowingly possesses an offensive
  3 27 weapon commits a class "D" felony, punishable by confinement
  3 28 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
  3 29 more than $7,500.
  3 30    The bill strikes a provision in Code section 724.1(1)(h)
  3 31 that classifies a firearm suppressor as an offensive weapon.
  3 32 By striking this provision, a firearm suppressor is legal to
  3 33 possess in the state.
  3 34    The bill also creates in new Code section 724.1A, a process
  3 35 whereby a person may apply to the chief law enforcement officer
  4  1 of the jurisdiction where the person resides or maintains an
  4  2 address of record for a certification to make or transfer a
  4  3 firearm suppressor.  The bill defines "firearm suppressor" to
  4  4 mean a mechanical device specifically constructed and designed
  4  5 so that when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or
  4  6 suppresses the sound when fired and that is considered a
  4  7 "firearm silencer" or "firearm muffler" as defined in 18 U.S.C.

  4  9    The bill specifies that a chief law enforcement officer
  4 10 shall not refuse to provide certification, based on a

  4 12 or transfer a firearm suppressor.  If a person applies for
  4 13 certification to make or transfer a firearm suppressor with
  4 14 the chief law enforcement officer, the bill requires the chief
  4 15 law enforcement officer to issue the certification within 30
  4 16 days of receiving such an application unless the applicant
  4 17 is prohibited by law from making or transferring a firearm
  4 18 suppressor or the applicant is the subject of a proceeding that
  4 19 could result in the applicant being prohibited by law from
  4 20 making or transferring a firearm suppressor.  If the chief
  4 21 law enforcement officer does not issue a certification under
  4 22 the bill, the chief law enforcement officer shall provide the
  4 23 applicant a written notification of the denial and the reason
  4 24 for the denial.  If the certification has been approved by the
  4 25 chief law enforcement officer under the bill, the applicant
  4 26 has the authority to make or transfer a firearm suppressor as
  4 27 provided by state and federal law.
  4 28    If the applicant's request for certification is denied,
  4 29 the bill specifies that the applicant may appeal the decision
  4 30 to the district court for the county in which the applicant
  4 31 resides or maintains an address of record.  The bill specifies

  4 12 or transfer a firearm suppressor.  If a person applies for
  4 13 certification to make or transfer a firearm suppressor with
  4 14 the chief law enforcement officer, the bill requires the chief
  4 15 law enforcement officer to issue the certification within 30
  4 16 days of receiving such an application unless the applicant
  4 17 is prohibited by law from making or transferring a firearm
  4 18 suppressor or the applicant is the subject of a proceeding that
  4 19 could result in the applicant being prohibited by law from
  4 20 making or transferring a firearm suppressor.  If the chief
  4 21 law enforcement officer does not issue a certification under
  4 22 the bill, the chief law enforcement officer shall provide the
  4 23 applicant a written notification of the denial and the reason
  4 24 for the denial.  If the certification has been approved by the
  4 25 chief law enforcement officer under the bill, the applicant
  4 26 has the authority to make or transfer a firearm suppressor as
  4 27 provided by state and federal law.
  4 28    If the applicant's request for certification is denied,

  4 31 resides or maintains an address of record.  The bill specifies
  4 32 that the court shall review the decision of the chief law
  4 33 enforcement officer to deny the certification de novo.  If the
  4 34 court finds that the applicant is not prohibited by law from
  4 35 making or transferring a firearm suppressor, and is not the
  5  1 subject of a proceeding that could result in such prohibition,
  5  2 or that no substantial evidence supports the decision of the
  5  3 chief law enforcement officer, the bill requires the court
  5  4 to order the chief law enforcement officer to issue the
  5  5 certification and award court costs and reasonable attorney
  5  6 fees to the applicant. If the court determines the applicant
  5  7 is not eligible to be issued a certification, the bill requires
  5  8 the court to award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to
  5  9 the political subdivision of the state representing the chief
  5 10 law enforcement officer.
  5 11    In making a determination about whether to issue a
  5 12 certification under the bill, a chief law enforcement officer
  5 13 may conduct a criminal background check, but shall only require
  5 14 the applicant to provide as much information as is necessary
  5 15 to identify the applicant for this purpose or to determine
  5 16 the disposition of an arrest or proceeding relevant to the
  5 17 eligibility of the applicant to lawfully make or transfer a
  5 18 firearm suppressor. The bill prohibits a chief law enforcement
  5 19 officer from requiring access to any private premises as a

  3 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 20    This bill relates to the possession and transferring of
  3 21 firearm suppressors.
  3 22    FIREARM SUPPRESSORS.  Current Iowa law provides that a
  3 23 mechanical device specifically constructed and designed so that
  3 24 when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or suppresses
  3 25 the sound when fired is an offensive weapon.  Under Code
  3 26 section 724.3, any person who knowingly possesses an offensive
  3 27 weapon commits a class "D" felony, punishable by confinement
  3 28 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not
  3 29 more than $7,500.
  3 30    The bill strikes a provision in Code section 724.1(1)(h)
  3 31 that classifies a firearm suppressor as an offensive weapon.
  3 32 By striking this provision, a firearm suppressor is legal to
  3 33 possess in the state.
  3 34    The bill also creates in new Code section 724.1A, a process
  3 35 whereby a person may apply to the chief law enforcement officer
  4  1 of the jurisdiction where the person resides or maintains an
  4  2 address of record for a certification to make or transfer a
  4  3 firearm suppressor.  The bill defines "firearm suppressor" to
  4  4 mean a mechanical device specifically constructed and designed
  4  5 so that when attached to a firearm it silences, muffles, or
  4  6 suppresses the sound when fired and that is considered a
  4  7 "firearm silencer" or "firearm muffler" as defined in 18 U.S.C.

  4 18 suppressor or the applicant is the subject of a proceeding that
  4 19 could result in the applicant being prohibited by law from
  4 20 making or transferring a firearm suppressor.  If the chief
  4 21 law enforcement officer does not issue a certification under
  4 22 the bill, the chief law enforcement officer shall provide the
  4 23 applicant a written notification of the denial and the reason
  4 24 for the denial.  If the certification has been approved by the
  4 25 chief law enforcement officer under the bill, the applicant
  4 26 has the authority to make or transfer a firearm suppressor as
  4 27 provided by state and federal law.
  4 28    If the applicant's request for certification is denied,
  4 29 the bill specifies that the applicant may appeal the decision
  4 30 to the district court for the county in which the applicant
  4 31 resides or maintains an address of record.  The bill specifies
  4 32 that the court shall review the decision of the chief law
  4 33 enforcement officer to deny the certification de novo.  If the
  4 34 court finds that the applicant is not prohibited by law from
  4 35 making or transferring a firearm suppressor, and is not the
  5  1 subject of a proceeding that could result in such prohibition,
  5  2 or that no substantial evidence supports the decision of the
  5  3 chief law enforcement officer, the bill requires the court
  5  4 to order the chief law enforcement officer to issue the
  5  5 certification and award court costs and reasonable attorney
  5  6 fees to the applicant. If the court determines the applicant
  5  7 is not eligible to be issued a certification, the bill requires
  5  8 the court to award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to
  5  9 the political subdivision of the state representing the chief
  5 10 law enforcement officer.
  5 11    In making a determination about whether to issue a
  5 12 certification under the bill, a chief law enforcement officer
  5 13 may conduct a criminal background check, but shall only require
  5 14 the applicant to provide as much information as is necessary
