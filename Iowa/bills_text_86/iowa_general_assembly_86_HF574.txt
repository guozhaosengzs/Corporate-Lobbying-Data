  1 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill expands the renewable fuel
  1 25 infrastructure program for retail motor fuel sites (program)
  1 26 by providing that state moneys may be used to finance
  1 27 infrastructure associated with storing and dispensing ethanol
  1 28 blended gasoline classified as E=15. The bill provides that
  1 29 the infrastructure so financed must always be used to store and
  1 30 dispense E=15 and during nonsummer months (from September 16 to
  1 31 May 31) it must be designated as a registered fuel recognized
  1 32 by the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) to
  1 33 operate 2001 and newer model year passenger vehicles.
  1 34    BACKGROUND ==== STANDARDS.  Motor fuel classified as
  1 35 reformulated gasoline and associated fuel additives produced
  2  1 and commercially distributed to operate highway motor vehicles
  2  2 must be registered with the EPA (40 C.F.R. ch. I, pt. 79). E=15
  2  3 is available to power certain later model passenger vehicles
  2  4 pursuant to waivers granted by the EPA.  However, the EPA
  2  5 prohibits the use of E=15 to power those vehicles when it is
  2  6 regulated as a registered fuel during summer months because it
  2  7 does not meet volatility standards referred to as Reid vapor
  2  8 pressure limits. General state standards for ethanol blended
  2  9 gasoline are set forth in Iowa Code section 214A.2.  Ethanol
  2 10 blended gasoline is designated E=xx where "xx" is the volume
  2 11 percent of ethanol in the ethanol blended gasoline.
  2 12    BACKGROUND ==== PROGRAM.  The program is currently used to
  2 13 provide cost=share financing to retail dealers of motor fuel
  2 14 to pay for costs associated with installing, replacing, or
  2 15 converting infrastructure used to store, blend, or dispense
  2 16 renewable fuel, including ethanol blended gasoline such as
  2 17 E=85 (Code section 159A.14). The program is supported by
  2 18 moneys available in the renewable fuel infrastructure fund
  2 19 (Code section 159A.16) as administered by the department
  2 20 of agriculture and land stewardship, the renewable fuel
  2 21 infrastructure board (Iowa Code section 159A.13), and the Iowa
  2 22 comprehensive petroleum underground storage tank fund board

  2 14 to pay for costs associated with installing, replacing, or
  2 15 converting infrastructure used to store, blend, or dispense
  2 16 renewable fuel, including ethanol blended gasoline such as
  2 17 E=85 (Code section 159A.14). The program is supported by

  2 20 of agriculture and land stewardship, the renewable fuel
  2 21 infrastructure board (Iowa Code section 159A.13), and the Iowa
