  1 13    Sec. 2.    1 13    Sec. 2.    1 14 == value added exemption from tax.
  1 15    1.  A city council or a county board of supervisors may
  1 16 provide by ordinance for an exemption from property taxation
  1 17 of the actual value added by improvements made to residential
  1 18 property if the property is a public nuisance prior to the
  1 19 improvements.  A city council may provide for an exemption to
  1 20 such property located within the boundaries of the city and the
  1 21 county board of supervisors may provide for an exemption to
  1 22 such property located outside the boundaries of a city.
  1 23    2.  All property described in subsection 1 for which an
  1 24 exemption has been approved by ordinance is eligible to receive
  1 25 a one hundred percent exemption from taxation on the actual
  1 26 value added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a
  1 27 period of ten years beginning not later than the first year
  1 28 in which all improvements described in the application are
  1 29 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 30 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 31 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 32 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 33 property.
  1 34    3.  a.  The ordinance providing for the exemption may
  1 35 designate a length of time of less than ten years that the
  2  1 exemption shall be available and may designate an exemption
  2  2 percentage or schedule of percentages that is less than one
  2  3 hundred percent.
  2  4    b.  The city council or the board of supervisors may, as part
  2  5 of the resolution approving an exemption application, specify
  2  6 an exemption duration or exemption percentage that is different
  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.
  3 28    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 33 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 34 contract.
  3 35    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  4  1 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  4  2 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  4  3 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  4  4 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  4  5 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  4  6 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  4  7 abandonment.
  4  8    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  4  9 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed

  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  1 31 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 32 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 33 property.
  1 34    3.  a.  The ordinance providing for the exemption may

  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.

  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.

  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by

  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased

  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  1 29 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 30 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 31 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 32 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 33 property.
  1 34    3.  a.  The ordinance providing for the exemption may
  1 35 designate a length of time of less than ten years that the
  2  1 exemption shall be available and may designate an exemption
  2  2 percentage or schedule of percentages that is less than one
  2  3 hundred percent.
  2  4    b.  The city council or the board of supervisors may, as part
  2  5 of the resolution approving an exemption application, specify
  2  6 an exemption duration or exemption percentage that is different
  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.
  3 28    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 33 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2  5 of the resolution approving an exemption application, specify
  2  6 an exemption duration or exemption percentage that is different
  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.

  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner

  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".

  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for

  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.

  4  4 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  4  5 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  4  6 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  4  7 abandonment.
  4  8    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2  4    b.  The city council or the board of supervisors may, as part
  2  5 of the resolution approving an exemption application, specify
  2  6 an exemption duration or exemption percentage that is different
  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature

  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.

  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property

  4  9 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the

  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but

  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to

  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a

  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of

  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the

  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the

  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but

  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the

  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a

  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner

  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased

  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body

  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2  4    b.  The city council or the board of supervisors may, as part
  2  5 of the resolution approving an exemption application, specify
  2  6 an exemption duration or exemption percentage that is different
  2  7 than that designated in the ordinance.  However, the different
  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.
  3 28    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 33 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or

  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but

  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the

  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2  8 duration or percentage specified in the resolution shall not
  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2  9 exceed that which is provided for in the ordinance.
  2 10    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2 11 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2 12 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2 13 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 14 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.
  3 28    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 33 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 34 contract.
  3 35    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  4  1 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally

  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by

  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but

  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a

  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2 15 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 16 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 17    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 18 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, a list of
  2 19 all other federal, state, or local government tax credits,
  2 20 exemptions, grants, forgivable loans, or other forms of
  2 21 financial assistance received by or applied for by the owner
  2 22 for completion of the improvements, and the estimated or actual
  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.

  3 29 otherwise requires:
  3 30    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 31 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 32    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 33 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 34 contract.
  3 35    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  4  1 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  4  2 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  4  3 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  4  4 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  4  5 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  4  6 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  4  7 abandonment.
  4  8    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  4  9 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the

  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but

  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased

  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property

  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the

  4  8    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2 23 date of completion of the improvements.
  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 26 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 27 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 28 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 29 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 30 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by

  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  3  2 to approve or reject.
  3  3    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  3  4 application by making a physical review of the property to
  3  5 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  3  6 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3 17 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2,
  3 18 or specified in a different schedule if one has been adopted
  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant
  3 21 to subsection 3, paragraph "b".
  3 22    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 23 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 26 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 27 their expiration.
  3 28    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 29 otherwise requires:

  4  4 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  4  5 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  4  6 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or

  4  8    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  4  9 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the

  2 24    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 25 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 31 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by
  2 34 resolution of the governing body of the city or county.
  2 35    e.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  3  1 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body

  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a

  3 19 under subsection 3, paragraph "a", or in the resolution of the
  3 20 governing body under which the exemption was granted pursuant

  3 24 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 25 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or

  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a

  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property

  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the

  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may

  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.

  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  2 32 as a result of the improvements.
  2 33    d.  Approval of an exemption application shall be by

  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  3  7 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  3  8 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  3  9 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  3 10 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3 11 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3 12 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3 13 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3 14 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3 15 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3 16 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by

  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may

  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the

  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5 26    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5 27 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5 28 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5 29 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 30 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 31 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 32 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 33 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 34 state appropriation.

  4 10                           EXPLANATION
  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.

  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4 14 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4 15 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4 16 property by improvements to the property if the property
  4 17 is a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior to the
  4 18 improvements.
  4 19    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4 20 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 21 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 22 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 23 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 24 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 25 for taxation.  The ordinance providing for the exemption from
  4 26 tax may designate a length of time of less than 10 years and may
  4 27 designate an exemption percentage or schedule of percentages
  4 28 that is less than 100 percent.  The resolution approving the
  4 29 exemption application may also provide for a different period
  4 30 of exemption and exemption percentage than what is provided in
  4 31 the ordinance, but not exceeding the duration and percentages
  4 32 in the ordinance.
  4 33    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 34 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 35 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  5  1 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  5  2 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  5  3 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  5  4 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  5  5 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  5  6 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  5  7 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  5  8 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  5  9 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  5 10 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  5 11    The bill requires the application to list all other federal,
  5 12 state, or local government tax credits, exemptions, grants,
  5 13 forgivable loans, or other forms of financial assistance
  5 14 received by or applied for by the owner for completion of the
  5 15 improvements.
  5 16    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  5 17 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  5 18 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  5 19 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  5 20 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5 21 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5 22 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5 23 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5 24 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5 25 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
