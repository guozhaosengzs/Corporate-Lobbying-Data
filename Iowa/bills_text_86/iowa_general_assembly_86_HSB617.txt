Section
1.
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
1


following:
2


1.
During
times
of
disaster
or
emergency,
many
businesses
3


bring
in
resources
and
personnel
from
other
states
on
a
4


temporary
basis
to
expedite
the
often
enormous
and
overwhelming
5


task
of
cleaning
up,
restoring,
and
repairing
damaged
6


buildings,
equipment,
and
property,
or
even
deploying
or
7


building
replacement
facilities
in
the
state.
8


2.
These
undertakings
may
involve
the
need
for
out-of-state
9


businesses,
including
out-of-state
affiliates
of
businesses
10


based
in
the
state,
to
bring
in
resources,
property,
11


or
personnel
to
perform
activities
related
to
critical
12


infrastructure
in
the
state,
including
but
not
limited
to
13


repairing,
renovating,
installing,
building,
and
rendering
14


services
or
other
business
activities,
and
for
which
personnel
15


may
be
located
in
the
state
for
extended
periods
of
time
to
16


perform
such
activities.
17


3.
During
such
time
of
operating
in
the
state
on
a
18


temporary
basis
solely
for
purposes
of
helping
the
state
19


recover
from
the
disaster
or
emergency,
these
businesses
and
20


individual
employees
should
not
be
burdened
by
any
requirements
21


for
business
and
employee
taxes
as
a
result
of
such
activities
22


in
the
state,
and
the
state’s
nexus
and
residency
thresholds
23


should
not
be
applied
to
businesses
and
individuals
coming
into
24


the
state
on
a
temporary
basis
to
provide
help
and
assistance
25


in
response
to
a
declared
state
disaster
or
emergency.
26


4.
To
ensure
that
businesses
may
focus
on
quick
response
27


to
the
needs
of
the
state
and
its
citizens
during
a
declared
28


state
disaster
or
emergency
it
is
appropriate
for
the
general
29


assembly
to
deem
that
such
activity
for
a
reasonable
period
of
30


time
before,
during,
and
after
the
disaster
or
emergency
shall
31


not
establish
presence,
residency,
or
doing
business
in
the
32


state
or
any
other
criteria
for
purposes
of
state
and
local
33


taxes,
licensing,
and
regulatory
requirements.
