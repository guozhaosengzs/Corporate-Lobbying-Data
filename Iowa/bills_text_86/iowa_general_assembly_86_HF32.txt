  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to

 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,

 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable

 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.

 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with

 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before

 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;

 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The

  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the

 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the

 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by

 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a

 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.

 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury

 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles

 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,

 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to

 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's

 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles

 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or

 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.

 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance

 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles

 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.

 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;

 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's
 12  7 designated agent are not liable to any person for gathering,
 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in
 12  9 compliance with the bill.
 12 10    The bill provides for an effective date of July 1, 2016.

 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with

 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by

 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative

 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of

 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a

 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's

 12  8 managing, or using the information in the database in

 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or

 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second

 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund

 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;

 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.

 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's

  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance

  9 29                           EXPLANATION
  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
  9 33 program within the department of transportation.  The
  9 34 department is required to contract with a third party to act
  9 35 as the department's designated agent for administration of the
 10  1 program.
 10  2    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain
 10  3 a database containing information from insurers relating to
 10  4 motor vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles,
 10  5 personal identification information for licensed drivers
 10  6 provided by the department, and any other information provided
 10  7 to the designated agent by the department.
 10  8    At least twice a month, the designated agent shall update the
 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to
 10 17 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 10 18 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 10 19 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 10 20 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 10 21 notice will be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 10 22 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration will be
 10 23 revoked by the department and the owner will be required to
 10 24 surrender the registration plates and registration receipt for
 10 25 the vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a
 10 26 new registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 10 27 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of
 10 31 the program are to be transferred to the road use tax fund
 10 32 annually on June 30.
 10 33    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 10 34 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 10 35 policy, that fact shall be noted in the database, with a
 11  1 requirement that the information be updated annually by the
 11  2 owner.
 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer
 11 18 and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in this state
 11 19 as of the date of the previous submission.  Vehicles subject to
 11 20 apportioned registration are not included in this requirement.
 11 21 Insurers that fail to comply with the reporting requirement
 11 22 may be assessed a civil penalty of $250 per day.  However,
 11 23 the department may waive the penalty upon a showing that the
 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
 11 27 but the bill provides exceptions for disclosures to state or
 11 28 local government agencies and courts for specified purposes;
 11 29 to individuals and certain other authorized persons; for
 11 30 purposes of an accident investigation; to law enforcement
 11 31 agencies and peace officers for certain official purposes;
 11 32 to the state auditor; and to financial institutions with a
 11 33 security interest in a motor vehicle.  The designated agent
 11 34 may be authorized to provide certified copies or electronic
 11 35 records, as appropriate, and to charge a fee for the provision
 12  1 of records and authentication of documents.
 12  2    A person who knowingly releases or discloses information
 12  3 from the database for a purpose other than those authorized in
 12  4 the bill or to a person who is not entitled to such information
 12  5 is guilty of a class "D" felony.
 12  6    The bill provides that the state and the department's

 10  9 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 10 10 updated insurance information.  The files in the database shall
 10 11 be archived semiannually and audited by the department at least
 10 12 annually.  The bill requires the department to adopt rules for
 10 13 administration of the database.
 10 14    If database records show that a registered motor vehicle
 10 15 is not covered under an owner's policy of liability insurance
 10 16 for three months, the designated agent shall send a notice to

 10 28 fee of $100. The fees are to be used by the department
 10 29 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program.
 10 30 Any fees in excess of the amount needed for administration of

 11  3    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 11  4 fraudulent information to the department or the department's
 11  5 designated agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance
 11  6 verification program.  A violation is a simple misdemeanor.
 11  7    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy that
 11  8 includes motor vehicle liability coverage, uninsured motorist
 11  9 coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or personal injury
 11 10 coverage to the owner of a motor vehicle to provide, before
 11 11 the 7th and the 21st of each month, to the department's
 11 12 designated agent a record of each motor vehicle insurance
 11 13 policy issued by the insurer and in effect for vehicles
 11 14 registered or garaged in this state as of the date of the
 11 15 previous submission.  Insurers that issue commercial motor
 11 16 vehicle insurance policies must also provide a record of each
 11 17 commercial motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the insurer

 11 24 failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the result of excusable
 11 25 neglect.
 11 26    Information contained in the database is confidential,
