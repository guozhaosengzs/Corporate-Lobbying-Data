  5 31    1.  As a condition for allowing an environmental practices
  5 32 tax credit, the eligible crop farmer and the department must
  5 33 execute an environmental practices agreement as provided in
  5 34 this section.
  5 35    2.  The agreement shall be signed by the eligible crop farmer
  6  1 and a copy of the agreement shall be attached to an application
  6  2 for an environmental practices tax credit certificate as
  6  3 required in section 467.8. The department's execution of the
  6  4 agreement is contingent upon the department's approval of the
  6  5 application.
  6  6    3.  a.  The agreement shall also require that the eligible
  6  7 crop farmer maintain the qualified environmental practice
  6  8 so that when placed in service it effectively performs the
  6  9 function for which it was originally established for the period
  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental
  6 12 practice must be kept in good repair, or be reconstructed
  6 13 if necessary.  A qualified environmental practice is not
  6 14 maintained if it is removed, altered, or modified so that it
  6 15 no longer effectively performs the function for which it was
  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of
  6 19 the qualified environmental practice for the remaining period
  6 20 of the agreement. A successor in interest to the cropland
  6 21 shall not be responsible for the maintenance of the qualified
  6 22 environmental practice. The agreement does not create a legal
  6 23 or equitable interest in the cropland.
  6 24    5.  The term of the  agreement commences on the date that
  6 25 the department approves the application for the environmental
  6 26 practices tax credit.  The term of the agreement shall not
  6 27 exceed twenty years.
  6 28    6.  a.  The eligible crop farmer must consent to the
  6 29 department inspecting the location where the qualified
  6 30 environmental practice is established.  Nothing in this section
  6 31 prevents the department from inspecting the location of a
  6 32 proposed environmental practice.
  6 33    b.  Upon approving an application and executing the
  6 34 agreement, the department may inspect the location where the
  6 35 qualified environmental practice is established upon consent
  7  1 of the eligible crop farmer or under an administrative search
  7  2 warrant obtained under section 808.14.
  7  3    c.  The department may arrange that any inspection
  7  4 be conducted by the commissioners of the soil and water
  7  5 conservation district where the cropland is located as provided
  7  6 in chapter 161A.
  7  7    7.  The department may enforce the terms and conditions of
  7  8 the agreement by administrative order.  The courts of this
  7  9 state may prevent and restrain a breach of an agreement through
  7 10 the issuance of an injunction.  The attorney general may bring
  7 11 an action on behalf of the department to enforce the terms and
  7 12 conditions of the agreement.
  7 13    8.  a.  If an agreement is terminated after the tax credit
  7 14 is claimed, the department shall rescind the tax credit
  7 15 certificate and demand a refund of the amount of the tax credit
  7 16 claimed multiplied by an effective interest rate as provided
  7 17 in this subsection.  The payment due must be remitted to the
  7 18 department for deposit in the state treasury within thirty days
  7 19 from the date the department delivers notice of payment due to
  7 20 the crop farmer or the farmer's estate.
  7 21    b.  The effective interest rate is based on the current rate
  7 22 published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the department
  7 23 of revenue pursuant to section 421.7 on the date that the
  7 24 department notifies the eligible crop farmer or the farmer's
  7 25 estate of the payment amount due.
  7 26    c.  (1)  The termination is nonhostile under any of the
  7 27 following circumstances:
  7 28    (a)  The cropland is transferred for fair value to another
  7 29 person, so long as each person who executed the agreement has
  7 30 relinquished any apparent, real, or contingent interest in the
  7 31 cropland, and the department is notified of the transfer not
  7 32 more than ninety days after the transfer is effective.
  7 33    (b)  The cropland is to be converted to a use incompatible
  7 34 with crop production, and the department is notified of the
  7 35 change in use not more than ninety days after the effective
  8  1 date of the change.
  8  2    (2)  Under the circumstance described in  subparagraph (1),
  8  3 the effective interest rate for a nonhostile termination equals
  8  4 the current rate.
  8  5    (3)  A refund of tax credit amounts claimed and carried
  8  6 forward is not owing or required to be paid under this
  8  7 paragraph "c", if the successor titleholder of the cropland
  8  8 agrees in writing to assume the liability of the eligible crop
  8  9 farmer under the agreement.
  8 10    d.  The termination is hostile under any circumstances not
  8 11 described in paragraph "a".  The effective interest rate for a
  8 12 hostile termination equals ten times the current rate.
  8 13    Sec. 11.    5 31    1.  As a condition for allowing an environmental practices
  5 32 tax credit, the eligible crop farmer and the department must
  5 33 execute an environmental practices agreement as provided in
  5 34 this section.
  5 35    2.  The agreement shall be signed by the eligible crop farmer
  6  1 and a copy of the agreement shall be attached to an application
  6  2 for an environmental practices tax credit certificate as
  6  3 required in section 467.8. The department's execution of the
  6  4 agreement is contingent upon the department's approval of the
  6  5 application.
  6  6    3.  a.  The agreement shall also require that the eligible
  6  7 crop farmer maintain the qualified environmental practice
  6  8 so that when placed in service it effectively performs the
  6  9 function for which it was originally established for the period
  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental
  6 12 practice must be kept in good repair, or be reconstructed
  6 13 if necessary.  A qualified environmental practice is not
  6 14 maintained if it is removed, altered, or modified so that it
  6 15 no longer effectively performs the function for which it was
  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of
  6 19 the qualified environmental practice for the remaining period
  6 20 of the agreement. A successor in interest to the cropland
  6 21 shall not be responsible for the maintenance of the qualified
  6 22 environmental practice. The agreement does not create a legal
  6 23 or equitable interest in the cropland.
  6 24    5.  The term of the  agreement commences on the date that
  6 25 the department approves the application for the environmental
  6 26 practices tax credit.  The term of the agreement shall not
  6 27 exceed twenty years.
  6 28    6.  a.  The eligible crop farmer must consent to the
  6 29 department inspecting the location where the qualified
  6 30 environmental practice is established.  Nothing in this section
  6 31 prevents the department from inspecting the location of a
  6 32 proposed environmental practice.
  6 33    b.  Upon approving an application and executing the
  6 34 agreement, the department may inspect the location where the
  6 35 qualified environmental practice is established upon consent
  7  1 of the eligible crop farmer or under an administrative search
  7  2 warrant obtained under section 808.14.
  7  3    c.  The department may arrange that any inspection
  7  4 be conducted by the commissioners of the soil and water
  7  5 conservation district where the cropland is located as provided
  7  6 in chapter 161A.
  7  7    7.  The department may enforce the terms and conditions of
  7  8 the agreement by administrative order.  The courts of this

  7 17 in this subsection.  The payment due must be remitted to the
  7 18 department for deposit in the state treasury within thirty days
  7 19 from the date the department delivers notice of payment due to
  7 20 the crop farmer or the farmer's estate.
  7 21    b.  The effective interest rate is based on the current rate
  7 22 published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the department
  7 23 of revenue pursuant to section 421.7 on the date that the
  7 24 department notifies the eligible crop farmer or the farmer's
  7 25 estate of the payment amount due.
  7 26    c.  (1)  The termination is nonhostile under any of the
  7 27 following circumstances:
  7 28    (a)  The cropland is transferred for fair value to another
  7 29 person, so long as each person who executed the agreement has
  7 30 relinquished any apparent, real, or contingent interest in the
  7 31 cropland, and the department is notified of the transfer not
  7 32 more than ninety days after the transfer is effective.
  7 33    (b)  The cropland is to be converted to a use incompatible
  7 34 with crop production, and the department is notified of the
  7 35 change in use not more than ninety days after the effective

  8  4 the current rate.
  8  5    (3)  A refund of tax credit amounts claimed and carried
  8  6 forward is not owing or required to be paid under this
  8  7 paragraph "c", if the successor titleholder of the cropland
  8  8 agrees in writing to assume the liability of the eligible crop
  8  9 farmer under the agreement.
  8 10    d.  The termination is hostile under any circumstances not
  8 11 described in paragraph "a".  The effective interest rate for a
  8 12 hostile termination equals ten times the current rate.

  5 33 execute an environmental practices agreement as provided in
  5 34 this section.
  5 35    2.  The agreement shall be signed by the eligible crop farmer
  6  1 and a copy of the agreement shall be attached to an application
  6  2 for an environmental practices tax credit certificate as
  6  3 required in section 467.8. The department's execution of the

  6  6    3.  a.  The agreement shall also require that the eligible
  6  7 crop farmer maintain the qualified environmental practice
  6  8 so that when placed in service it effectively performs the
  6  9 function for which it was originally established for the period
  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental
  6 12 practice must be kept in good repair, or be reconstructed
  6 13 if necessary.  A qualified environmental practice is not
  6 14 maintained if it is removed, altered, or modified so that it
  6 15 no longer effectively performs the function for which it was
  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of
  6 19 the qualified environmental practice for the remaining period
  6 20 of the agreement. A successor in interest to the cropland
  6 21 shall not be responsible for the maintenance of the qualified
  6 22 environmental practice. The agreement does not create a legal
  6 23 or equitable interest in the cropland.
  6 24    5.  The term of the  agreement commences on the date that
  6 25 the department approves the application for the environmental
  6 26 practices tax credit.  The term of the agreement shall not
  6 27 exceed twenty years.
  6 28    6.  a.  The eligible crop farmer must consent to the
  6 29 department inspecting the location where the qualified
  6 30 environmental practice is established.  Nothing in this section
  6 31 prevents the department from inspecting the location of a
  6 32 proposed environmental practice.
  6 33    b.  Upon approving an application and executing the
  6 34 agreement, the department may inspect the location where the
  6 35 qualified environmental practice is established upon consent
  7  1 of the eligible crop farmer or under an administrative search
  7  2 warrant obtained under section 808.14.
  7  3    c.  The department may arrange that any inspection
  7  4 be conducted by the commissioners of the soil and water
  7  5 conservation district where the cropland is located as provided
  7  6 in chapter 161A.
  7  7    7.  The department may enforce the terms and conditions of
  7  8 the agreement by administrative order.  The courts of this
  7  9 state may prevent and restrain a breach of an agreement through
  7 10 the issuance of an injunction.  The attorney general may bring
  7 11 an action on behalf of the department to enforce the terms and
  7 12 conditions of the agreement.
  7 13    8.  a.  If an agreement is terminated after the tax credit
  7 14 is claimed, the department shall rescind the tax credit
  7 15 certificate and demand a refund of the amount of the tax credit
  7 16 claimed multiplied by an effective interest rate as provided
  7 17 in this subsection.  The payment due must be remitted to the
  7 18 department for deposit in the state treasury within thirty days
  7 19 from the date the department delivers notice of payment due to
  7 20 the crop farmer or the farmer's estate.
  7 21    b.  The effective interest rate is based on the current rate
  7 22 published in the Iowa administrative bulletin by the department
  7 23 of revenue pursuant to section 421.7 on the date that the
  7 24 department notifies the eligible crop farmer or the farmer's
  7 25 estate of the payment amount due.
  7 26    c.  (1)  The termination is nonhostile under any of the
  7 27 following circumstances:
  7 28    (a)  The cropland is transferred for fair value to another
  7 29 person, so long as each person who executed the agreement has
  7 30 relinquished any apparent, real, or contingent interest in the
  7 31 cropland, and the department is notified of the transfer not
  7 32 more than ninety days after the transfer is effective.
  7 33    (b)  The cropland is to be converted to a use incompatible
  7 34 with crop production, and the department is notified of the
  7 35 change in use not more than ninety days after the effective
  8  1 date of the change.
  8  2    (2)  Under the circumstance described in  subparagraph (1),
  8  3 the effective interest rate for a nonhostile termination equals
  8  4 the current rate.
  8  5    (3)  A refund of tax credit amounts claimed and carried
  8  6 forward is not owing or required to be paid under this
  8  7 paragraph "c", if the successor titleholder of the cropland
  8  8 agrees in writing to assume the liability of the eligible crop
  8  9 farmer under the agreement.
  8 10    d.  The termination is hostile under any circumstances not
  8 11 described in paragraph "a".  The effective interest rate for a
  8 12 hostile termination equals ten times the current rate.

  5 35    2.  The agreement shall be signed by the eligible crop farmer
  6  1 and a copy of the agreement shall be attached to an application
  6  2 for an environmental practices tax credit certificate as
  6  3 required in section 467.8. The department's execution of the
  6  4 agreement is contingent upon the department's approval of the
  6  5 application.
  6  6    3.  a.  The agreement shall also require that the eligible
  6  7 crop farmer maintain the qualified environmental practice
  6  8 so that when placed in service it effectively performs the
  6  9 function for which it was originally established for the period
  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental
  6 12 practice must be kept in good repair, or be reconstructed
  6 13 if necessary.  A qualified environmental practice is not
  6 14 maintained if it is removed, altered, or modified so that it
  6 15 no longer effectively performs the function for which it was
  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of
  6 19 the qualified environmental practice for the remaining period
  6 20 of the agreement. A successor in interest to the cropland
  6 21 shall not be responsible for the maintenance of the qualified
  6 22 environmental practice. The agreement does not create a legal
  6 23 or equitable interest in the cropland.
  6 24    5.  The term of the  agreement commences on the date that
  6 25 the department approves the application for the environmental
  6 26 practices tax credit.  The term of the agreement shall not
  6 27 exceed twenty years.
  6 28    6.  a.  The eligible crop farmer must consent to the
  6 29 department inspecting the location where the qualified
  6 30 environmental practice is established.  Nothing in this section
  6 31 prevents the department from inspecting the location of a
  6 32 proposed environmental practice.
  6 33    b.  Upon approving an application and executing the
  6 34 agreement, the department may inspect the location where the
  6 35 qualified environmental practice is established upon consent
  7  1 of the eligible crop farmer or under an administrative search
  7  2 warrant obtained under section 808.14.
  7  3    c.  The department may arrange that any inspection
  7  4 be conducted by the commissioners of the soil and water
  7  5 conservation district where the cropland is located as provided
  7  6 in chapter 161A.
  7  7    7.  The department may enforce the terms and conditions of
  7  8 the agreement by administrative order.  The courts of this
  7  9 state may prevent and restrain a breach of an agreement through

  7 19 from the date the department delivers notice of payment due to

  7 27 following circumstances:
  7 28    (a)  The cropland is transferred for fair value to another

  7 32 more than ninety days after the transfer is effective.
  7 33    (b)  The cropland is to be converted to a use incompatible
  7 34 with crop production, and the department is notified of the

  8  7 paragraph "c", if the successor titleholder of the cropland
  8  8 agrees in writing to assume the liability of the eligible crop
  8  9 farmer under the agreement.
  8 10    d.  The termination is hostile under any circumstances not
  8 11 described in paragraph "a".  The effective interest rate for a
  8 12 hostile termination equals ten times the current rate.
  8 13    Sec. 11.    5 34 this section.
  5 35    2.  The agreement shall be signed by the eligible crop farmer
  6  1 and a copy of the agreement shall be attached to an application
  6  2 for an environmental practices tax credit certificate as

  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental
  6 12 practice must be kept in good repair, or be reconstructed

  6 14 maintained if it is removed, altered, or modified so that it
  6 15 no longer effectively performs the function for which it was
  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of
  6 19 the qualified environmental practice for the remaining period
  6 20 of the agreement. A successor in interest to the cropland

  6 10 specified in the agreement.
  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental

  6 16 originally established.
  6 17    4.   The agreement is a charge against the eligible crop
  6 18 farmer who shall be personally liable for the maintenance of

  6 11    b.  In order to be maintained, a qualified environmental

 11 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 32    This bill establishes an environmental practices tax credit.
 11 33 The purpose of the tax credit is to assist eligible crop
 11 34 farmers in reducing soil erosion and sediment loss, managing
 11 35 nutrients and reducing contaminant loads contributing to
 12  1 receiving surface waters, and improving surface water quality.
 12  2    The bill provides that the tax credit is to be administered
 12  3 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship and the
 12  4 department of revenue. The tax credit is allowed against
 12  5 individual and corporate income taxes.  The tax credit cannot
 12  6 be used for any part of the cost of a practice that was financed
 12  7 in whole or in part by federal or state moneys.  The tax credit
 12  8 must be claimed by an eligible crop farmer who has an annual
 12  9 gross income of less than $4 million.  In addition, the tax
 12 10 credit is only available for certain qualified environmental
 12 11 practices as set forth in the bill or as established by
 12 12 departmental rule that meets the purposes of the tax credit.
 12 13    The bill requires an eligible crop farmer to submit

 12 15 stewardship for approval which must include a qualified
 12 16 environmental practices agreement to be executed by the
 12 17 department and the eligible crop farmer if the department
 12 18 approves the application. The application must require that
 12 19 the practice be maintained for a specific number of years.
 12 20 The agreement does not create a lien on the land or bind a
 12 21 successor in interest.  It provides for the inspection of
 12 22 the qualified environmental practice and the agreement's
 12 23 enforcement.  It also provides for the termination of the
 12 24 agreement and recision of the tax credit and refund to the
 12 25 state of a prorated portion of the tax credit claimed together
 12 26 with interest.
 12 27    The bill provides for the issuance of a tax credit
 12 28 certificate which must be included with the taxpayer's state
 12 29 tax return in order to claim the tax credit.  It also provides
 12 30 for the transferability of the tax credit certificate to any
 12 31 number of subsequent transferees.  Not more than $3 million in
 12 32 tax credit certificates may be issued in any tax year.
 12 33    The bill takes effect upon enactment for environmental
 12 34 practices first conducted or installed on or after that date
 12 35 and applies retroactively to tax years beginning on and after
 13  1 January 1, 2015.
