  3 24    This bill relates to untested sexual abuse evidence

  3 30 requirements and questions that are to be a part of the survey
  3 31 sent to law enforcement agencies.
  3 32    The bill requires a law enforcement agency to submit the
  3 33 answers to the survey to the department of justice by January
  3 34 1, 2016.  If a law enforcement agency does not possess any

  4 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4 15 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  4 16 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  4 18 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  4 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  4 20 mandate included in the bill.

  3 29 abuse evidence collection kits.  The bill specifies numerous
  3 30 requirements and questions that are to be a part of the survey
  3 31 sent to law enforcement agencies.
  3 32    The bill requires a law enforcement agency to submit the
  3 33 answers to the survey to the department of justice by January
  3 34 1, 2016.  If a law enforcement agency does not possess any

  4 18 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  4 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  4 20 mandate included in the bill.

  3 24    This bill relates to untested sexual abuse evidence

  3 29 abuse evidence collection kits.  The bill specifies numerous
  3 30 requirements and questions that are to be a part of the survey
  3 31 sent to law enforcement agencies.
  3 32    The bill requires a law enforcement agency to submit the
  3 33 answers to the survey to the department of justice by January
  3 34 1, 2016.  If a law enforcement agency does not possess any

  4 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  4 20 mandate included in the bill.

  4  3    The bill requires the department of justice to compile
  4  4 the results of the survey and submit a written report to

  4  8 enforcement agency that failed to submit answers to the survey.
  4  9    The bill defines a "law enforcement agency" to mean any
  4 10 governmental agency that investigates persons suspected of
  4 11 or charged with a sex abuse crime, including any such agency
  4 12 that collects, stores, processes, transmits, or disseminates
  4 13 analysis of evidence collected in a sexual abuse crime.
  4 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4 15 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

  4 18 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  4 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  4 20 mandate included in the bill.

  3 27 a survey of law enforcement agencies charged with the
  3 28 maintenance, storage, or preservation of untested sexual
  3 29 abuse evidence collection kits.  The bill specifies numerous
  3 30 requirements and questions that are to be a part of the survey
  3 31 sent to law enforcement agencies.
  3 32    The bill requires a law enforcement agency to submit the
  3 33 answers to the survey to the department of justice by January
  3 34 1, 2016.  If a law enforcement agency does not possess any

  4  9    The bill defines a "law enforcement agency" to mean any
  4 10 governmental agency that investigates persons suspected of
  4 11 or charged with a sex abuse crime, including any such agency
  4 12 that collects, stores, processes, transmits, or disseminates
  4 13 analysis of evidence collected in a sexual abuse crime.
  4 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4 15 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  4 16 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  4 17 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  4 18 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  4 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  4 20 mandate included in the bill.
