  3  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  7    Current law provides that the school district in which
  3  8 a psychiatric unit of a licensed hospital or a licensed
  3  9 psychiatric medical institution for children, not operated by
  3 10 the state, is located shall be responsible for the provision
  3 11 of educational services to children residing in the unit or
  3 12 institution. The district of residence is required pay to the
  3 13 school district in which the psychiatric unit or institution
  3 14 is located a portion of the district of residence's district
  3 15 cost per pupil for each child based upon the proportion of the
  3 16 time each child is provided educational services while in the
  3 17 unit or institution to the total time for which the child is
  3 18 provided educational services during a normal school year.
  3 19    This bill provides that the required payment shall be
  3 20 calculated based on the tuition rate prescribed by Code section
  3 21 282.24 for students residing within another school district,
  3 22 instead of the district of residence's district cost per
  3 23 pupil. Code section 282.24 provides that the maximum tuition
  3 24 fee that may be charged for students residing within another
  3 25 school district is the district cost per pupil of the receiving
  3 26 district. The bill also provides that the actual special
  3 27 education instructional costs incurred for a child who resides
  3 28 in a unit or institution shall be paid by the district of
  3 29 residence of the child to the district in which the unit or
  3 30 institution is located, rather than the required tuition rate
  3 31 amount.
  3 32    The bill provides that, notwithstanding Code section
  3 33 282.24, if a child, who is not placed by the department of
  3 34 human services or a court in a day program treatment program
  3 35 in such psychiatric unit or institution, and who the board of
  4  1 directors of the district of residence has determined is likely
  4  2 to inflict harm on themselves or other students, is placed in
  4  3 the psychiatric unit or institution, the district of residence
  4  4 may use amounts received as supplementary weighting pursuant
  4  5 to Code section 257.11, subsection 4, (at=risk programs and
  4  6 alternative schools) to pay the instructional costs necessary
  4  7 to address the child's behavior during instructional time when
  4  8 those services are not otherwise provided to students who do
  4  9 not require special education and the costs exceed the costs
  4 10 of instruction of pupils in a regular curriculum and the costs
  4 11 exceed the maximum tuition rate prescribed by Code section
  4 12 282.24.
  4 13    The bill provides that if such a child meets the definition
  4 14 of returning dropout or potential dropout in Code section
  4 15 257.39, the district of residence may also use the funding
  4 16 for programs for returning dropouts and dropout prevention to
  4 17 pay the instructional costs necessary to address the child's
  4 18 behavior during instructional time when those services are
  4 19 not otherwise provided to students who do not require special
  4 20 education and the costs exceed the costs of instruction of
  4 21 pupils in a regular curriculum and the costs exceed the maximum
  4 22 tuition rate prescribed by Code section 282.24.
  4 23    The bill provides that, notwithstanding Code section
  4 24 282.31, subsection 1, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), if a
  4 25 child placed in the psychiatric unit or institution was not
  4 26 enrolled in the educational program of the child's district of

  3  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  7    Current law provides that the school district in which
  3  8 a psychiatric unit of a licensed hospital or a licensed
  3  9 psychiatric medical institution for children, not operated by
  3 10 the state, is located shall be responsible for the provision
  3 11 of educational services to children residing in the unit or
  3 12 institution. The district of residence is required pay to the
  3 13 school district in which the psychiatric unit or institution
  3 14 is located a portion of the district of residence's district
  3 15 cost per pupil for each child based upon the proportion of the
  3 16 time each child is provided educational services while in the
  3 17 unit or institution to the total time for which the child is
  3 18 provided educational services during a normal school year.
  3 19    This bill provides that the required payment shall be
  3 20 calculated based on the tuition rate prescribed by Code section
  3 21 282.24 for students residing within another school district,
  3 22 instead of the district of residence's district cost per
  3 23 pupil. Code section 282.24 provides that the maximum tuition
  3 24 fee that may be charged for students residing within another
  3 25 school district is the district cost per pupil of the receiving
  3 26 district. The bill also provides that the actual special
