  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  1 31    1.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment requirements
  1 32 of section 514C.6, a group policy, contract, or plan providing
  1 33 for third=party payment or prepayment of health, medical, and
  1 34 surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage benefits
  1 35 to covered individuals under twenty=two years of age for
  2  1 the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum
  2  2 disorders if the policy, contract, or plan is either of the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  A policy, contract, or plan issued by a carrier, as
  2  5 defined in section 513B.2, or an organized delivery system
  2  6 authorized under 1993 Iowa Acts, chapter 158, to an employer
  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.
  2 16    2.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise
  2 17 requires:
  2 18    a.  "Applied behavior analysis" means the design,
  2 19 implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications,

  2 23 observation, measurement, and functional analysis of the
  2 24 relations between environment and behavior.
  2 25    b.  "Autism spectrum disorder" means any of the pervasive
  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this

  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  1 33 for third=party payment or prepayment of health, medical, and
  1 34 surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage benefits
  1 35 to covered individuals under twenty=two years of age for
  2  1 the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum
  2  2 disorders if the policy, contract, or plan is either of the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  A policy, contract, or plan issued by a carrier, as
  2  5 defined in section 513B.2, or an organized delivery system
  2  6 authorized under 1993 Iowa Acts, chapter 158, to an employer
  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.

  2 19 implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications,
  2 20 using behavioral stimuli and consequences, to produce socially

  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  1 34 surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage benefits
  1 35 to covered individuals under twenty=two years of age for
  2  1 the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum
  2  2 disorders if the policy, contract, or plan is either of the
  2  3 following:

  2  5 defined in section 513B.2, or an organized delivery system

  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.
  2 16    2.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise

  2 23 observation, measurement, and functional analysis of the
  2 24 relations between environment and behavior.
  2 25    b.  "Autism spectrum disorder" means any of the pervasive
  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's
  2 27 disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's

  2 35 treatment programs, including applied behavior analysis, that

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the

  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section

  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer

  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior

  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  4                           EXPLANATION

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.

  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  2  4    a.  A policy, contract, or plan issued by a carrier, as

  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  2 23 observation, measurement, and functional analysis of the
  2 24 relations between environment and behavior.
  2 25    b.  "Autism spectrum disorder" means any of the pervasive
  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's

  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such
  2 32 definitions may be amended from time to time.  The commissioner

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  2  5 defined in section 513B.2, or an organized delivery system

  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than

  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that

  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or

  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.

  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to

  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans

  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare

  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability
  5 29 income insurance coverage, coverage issued as a supplement
  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this

  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2  7 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2  8 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such
  2 32 definitions may be amended from time to time.  The commissioner
  2 33 may adopt the definitions provided in such manual by reference.

  3  8 supervised experience.
  3  9    d.  "Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder" means the use

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made

  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to

  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2  9 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 10 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.
  2 16    2.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise

  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's
  2 27 disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such
  2 32 definitions may be amended from time to time.  The commissioner
  2 33 may adopt the definitions provided in such manual by reference.
  2 34    c.  "Behavioral health treatment" means counseling and
  2 35 treatment programs, including applied behavior analysis, that
  3  1 meet the following requirements:
  3  2    (1)  Are necessary to develop, maintain, or restore, to the
  3  3 maximum extent practicable, the functioning of an individual.
  3  4    (2)  Are provided or supervised by a behavior analyst

  3  7 commensurate with the psychologist's formal training and
  3  8 supervised experience.
  3  9    d.  "Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder" means the use
  3 10 of medically necessary assessments, evaluations, or tests to

  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 11 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 15 employees.
  2 16    2.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise
  2 17 requires:
  2 18    a.  "Applied behavior analysis" means the design,
  2 19 implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications,
  2 20 using behavioral stimuli and consequences, to produce socially
  2 21 significant improvement in human behavior or to prevent loss
  2 22 of attained skill or function, including the use of direct
  2 23 observation, measurement, and functional analysis of the
  2 24 relations between environment and behavior.

  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 12 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 13 employer.
  2 14    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's

  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this

  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds

  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care

  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider

  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 18    a.  "Applied behavior analysis" means the design,
  2 19 implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications,

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied

  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made

  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit

  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to

  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or

  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section

  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the

  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than

  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the

  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made

  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  2 26 developmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger's
  2 27 disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise

  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the

  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.

  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 28 specified.  The commissioner, by rule, shall define "autism
  2 29 spectrum disorder" consistent with definitions provided in the
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include

  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare

  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  2 30 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  2 31 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, as such

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding

  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer

  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.

  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made

  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  1 licensed psychologist pursuant to a comprehensive evaluation
  4  2 or reevaluation performed in a manner consistent with the most
  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans

  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the

  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party

  3 35 autism spectrum disorder developed by a licensed physician or
  4  1 licensed psychologist pursuant to a comprehensive evaluation
  4  2 or reevaluation performed in a manner consistent with the most
  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.

  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  3  3 maximum extent practicable, the functioning of an individual.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care

  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.

  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an

  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  6 27 severable.

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.

  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.

  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section

  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the

  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied

  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.

  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.

  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  6 27 severable.

  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism

  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or

  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received

  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the

  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.

  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that

  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.

  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied

  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party

  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the

  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.

  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be

  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.

  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.

  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed

  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:

  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this

  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4  2 or reevaluation performed in a manner consistent with the most
  4  3 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  4  4 academy of pediatrics, as determined by the commissioner by
  4  5 rule.
  4  6    3.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis is required
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this

  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.

  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under

  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of

  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this

  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this

  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4  7 pursuant to this section for a maximum benefit amount of
  4  8 thirty=six thousand dollars per year.  Beginning in 2020, the
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4  9 commissioner shall, on or before July 1 of each calendar year,
  4 10 publish an adjustment for inflation to the maximum benefit
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include

  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 11 required equal to the percentage change in the medical care
  4 12 component of the United States department of labor consumer
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 13 price index for all urban consumers in the preceding year, and
  4 14 the published adjusted maximum benefit shall be applicable to
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.

  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately

  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 15 group policies, contracts, or plans subject to this section
  4 16 that are delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed
  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.

  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or

  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code

  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 17 on or after January 1 of the following calendar year.  Payments
  4 18 made under a group policy, contract, or plan subject to this
  4 19 section on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.

  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.

  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.

  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any

  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this

  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of

  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 20 other than applied behavior analysis shall not be applied
  4 21 toward the maximum benefit established under this subsection.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider

  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 22    4.  Coverage for applied behavior analysis shall include the
  4 23 services of persons working under the supervision of a behavior
  4 24 analyst certified by a nationally recognized board or under
  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical
  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 25 the supervision of a licensed psychologist, to provide applied
  4 26 behavior analysis.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.

  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or

  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section

  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or

  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.

  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied

  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to

  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,

  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an

  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established

  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage

  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the

  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 27    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not be
  4 28 subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical

  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of

  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 29 make for treatment of an autism spectrum disorder.
  4 30    6.  Coverage required pursuant to this section shall not
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical
  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability
  5 29 income insurance coverage, coverage issued as a supplement
  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.

  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and

  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22

  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 31 be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical
  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability
  5 29 income insurance coverage, coverage issued as a supplement
  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 32 coinsurance provisions, or any other general exclusions or
  4 33 limitations of a group plan that are less favorable to an
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  4 35 coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.

  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed

  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual

  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  4 34 insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or

  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.

  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and
  7  2 225D.2.
  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.
  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  5  1 and surgical benefits under the policy, contract, or plan,
  5  2 except as provided in subsection 3.
  5  3    7.  Coverage required by this section shall be provided
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical
  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability
  5 29 income insurance coverage, coverage issued as a supplement
  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:

  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.

  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  5  4 in coordination with coverage required for the treatment of
  5  5 autistic disorders pursuant to section 514C.22.

  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.

  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:

  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  5  6    8.  This section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  5  7 which are otherwise available to an individual under a group
  5  8 policy, contract, or plan.
  5  9    9.  This section shall not be construed as affecting any
  5 10 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  5 11 individualized family service plan, an individualized education
  5 12 program, or an individualized service plan.
  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital
  5 26 confinement indemnity, credit, dental, vision, Medicare
  5 27 supplement, long=term care, basic hospital and medical=surgical
  5 28 expense coverage as defined by the commissioner, disability

  5 30 to liability insurance, workers' compensation or similar
  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:

  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the

  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or

  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  5 13    10.  Except for inpatient services, if an insured is
  5 14 receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer
  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of
  5 22 conducting a review of a treatment plan shall be borne by the
  5 23 insurer.
  5 24    11.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,
  5 25 specified disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital

  5 31 insurance, or automobile medical payment insurance, or
  5 32 individual accident and sickness policies issued to individuals
  5 33 or to individual members of a member association.
  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  6  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the
  6  6 general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  6  7 required under this section.  The report shall include
  6  8 information concerning but not limited to all of the following:
  6  9    (1)  The total number of insureds diagnosed with autism
  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  5 15 is entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  5 16 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  5 17 agree that a more frequent review is necessary.  An agreement
  5 18 giving an insurer the right to review the treatment plan of
  5 19 an insured more frequently applies only to that insured and
  5 20 does not apply to other individuals being treated for autism
  5 21 spectrum disorders by a physician or psychologist.  The cost of

  5 34    12.  The commissioner shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter
  5 35 17A to implement and administer this section.
  6  1    13.  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  6  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received

  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than

  7 34 benefit.

  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party

  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and

  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section

  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report

  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.

  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,

  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied

  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.

  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision

  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is

  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and

  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include

  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to

  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.

  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6  4    14.  a.  By February 1, 2018, and every February 1
  6  5 thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to the

  6 10 spectrum disorder in the immediately preceding calendar year.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately

  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are

  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.

  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,

  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for

  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application

  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by

  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the

  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6 11    (2)  The total cost of all claims paid out in the immediately
  6 12 preceding calendar year for coverage required under this
  6 13 section.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6 14    (3)  The cost of such coverage per insured per month.
  6 15    (4)  The average cost per insured per month for coverage of
  6 16 applied behavior analysis required under this section.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  3    2.  The section of this Act repealing section 514C.28.

  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6 17    b.  All third=party payment provider policies, contracts,
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.
  6 33    Sec. 5.  REPEAL.  Section 514C.28, Code 2016, is repealed.
  6 34    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  6 35 Act take effect January 1, 2017:
  7  1    1.  The sections of this Act amending sections 225D.1 and

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6 18 or plans, as specified in subsection 1, and plans established
  6 19 pursuant to chapter 509A shall provide the commissioner with
  6 20 data requested by the commissioner for inclusion in the annual
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this

  7  4                           EXPLANATION
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  6 21 report.
  6 22    15.  If any provision of this section or its application
  6 23 to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
  6 24 does not affect other provisions or application of this section
  6 25 which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
  6 26 application, and to this end the provisions of this section are
  6 27 severable.
  6 28    16.  This section applies to third=party payment provider
  6 29 policies, contracts, or plans, as specified in subsection 1,
  6 30 and to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A, that are
  6 31 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 32 state on or after January 1, 2017.

  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party

  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to

  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to

  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans

  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or

  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health

  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to

  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
  8 33    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  8 34 types of insurance.  The commissioner is required to adopt
  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision

  8 35 rules to implement and administer the provision.
  9  1  An insurer shall not terminate coverage of an individual
  9  2 solely because the individual is diagnosed with or has received
  9  3 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder.
  9  4    By February 1, 2018, and every February 1 thereafter, the
  9  5 commissioner of insurance is required to submit a report to
  9  6 the general assembly regarding implementation of the coverage
  9  7 required under the new Code section.  The annual report
  9  8 must include information about the total number of insureds
  9  9 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in the preceding
  9 10 calendar year, the total cost of all claims paid out for the
  9 11 required coverage, the cost of such coverage per insured per
  9 12 month, and the average cost per insured per month for the
  9 13 required coverage of applied behavior analysis.
  9 14    The new Code section is severable if any portion of the Code
  9 15 section or its application to any person or circumstance is
  9 16 held to be invalid.
  9 17    The new Code section applies to specified third=party
  9 18 payment provider policies, contracts, or plans, and to plans
  9 19 established pursuant to Code chapter 509A, that are delivered,
  9 20 issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this state on or
  9 21 after January 1, 2017.
  9 22    Code section 514C.28, which currently mandates coverage
  9 23 for autism spectrum disorders only in group plans established
  9 24 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for state employees, is repealed
  9 25 effective January 1, 2017.
  9 26    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  9 27 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  9 28 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  9 29 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  9 30 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  9 31 2017.
  7  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  7    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31 which requires
  7  8 certain group health insurance policies, contracts, or plans
  7  9 to provide coverage benefits for the screening, diagnosis, and
  7 10 treatment of autism spectrum disorders.  The new provision
  7 11 is applicable to group health policies, contracts, or plans
  7 12 issued to employers with more than 50 employees and to health
  7 13 plans established under Code chapter 509A for public employees.
  7 14 Coverage benefits are required for covered individuals under 22
  7 15 years of age.
  7 16    "Autism spectrum disorder" includes autistic disorder,
  7 17 Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders
  7 18 not otherwise specified, as defined by the commissioner of
  7 19 insurance by rule consistent with definitions provided in the
  7 20 most recent edition of the American psychiatric association's
  7 21 diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
  7 22    The required maximum benefit for coverage for applied
  7 23 behavior analysis is $36,000 per year.  Beginning in 2020,
  7 24 the commissioner is required to make and publish annual
  7 25 adjustments for inflation to the maximum benefit required equal
  7 26 to the percentage change in the medical care component of the
  7 27 United States department of labor consumer price index for
  7 28 all consumers in the previous year. The published adjusted
  7 29 maximum benefit is applicable to specified group policies,
  7 30 contracts, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  7 31 or renewed during the following calendar year. Payments made
  7 32 on behalf of a covered individual for any treatment other than
  7 33 applied behavior analysis cannot be applied toward this maximum
  7 34 benefit.
  7 35    Coverage for applied behavior analysis must include
  8  1 services rendered by persons working under the supervision of
  8  2 a certified behavior analyst or a licensed psychologist to
  8  3 provide applied behavior analysis.
  8  4    Required coverage cannot be subject to any limits on the
  8  5 number of visits an individual may make for treatment of an
  8  6 autism spectrum disorder.
  8  7    Required coverage cannot be subject to dollar limits,
  8  8 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  8  9 other general exclusions or limitations of a group plan that
  8 10 are less favorable to an insured than those that apply to
  8 11 physical illness generally under the policy, contract, or
  8 12 plan, except as to the maximum benefit limitation for applied
  8 13 behavior analysis coverage.
  8 14    Coverage of autism spectrum disorders under the new Code
  8 15 section is to be provided in coordination with coverage
  8 16 required for the treatment of autistic disorders pursuant to
  8 17 Code section 514C.22.  The Code section shall not be construed
  8 18 to limit benefits otherwise available to an individual under a
  8 19 group policy, contract, or plan.
  8 20    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  8 21 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  8 22 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  8 23 service plan.
  8 24    Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving
  8 25 treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer is
  8 26 entitled to review the treatment plan annually, unless the
  8 27 insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist
  8 28 agree that more frequent review is necessary.  Such an
  8 29 agreement applies only to that insured and does not apply to
  8 30 other individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by
  8 31 a physician or psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review
  8 32 of a treatment plan is to be borne by the insurer.
