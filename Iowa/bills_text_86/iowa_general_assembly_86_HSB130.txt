may
not
provide
the

while

driver
operates
a
motor
vehicle
in
connection
2


with
the
use
of
the
TNC’s
online-enabled
application
or
3


platform.
The
bill
also
requires
that,
within
30
days
of
the
4


date
a
driver
first
enters
the
app-on
stage
in
connection
5


with
a
TNC’s
online-enabled
application
or

the

6


shall
notify
the

providing
the

of
7


the

use
of
the
TNC’s
online-enabled
application
or
8


platform
unless
the
insurer
is
providing
TNC
insurance
to
the
9


driver.
10


The
bill
further
requires
a
TNC
and
a
driver,
during
the
11


app-on
stage,
the
engaged
stage,
and
the
passenger-on-board
12


stage,
to
maintain
coverage
in
the
amount
of
$1
million
13


per
accident
for
death,
bodily
injury,
and
property
damage,
14


and
$1
million
per
accident
for
uninsured,
underinsured,
or
15


hit-and-run
motor

The

must
also
16


provide
for

coverage
and
collision

17


comprehensive

provided
by
the
policy
of
the
owner
19


of
the
motor
vehicle
while
the
vehicle
is
operated
during
the

Either
the
TNC
or
the
driver,
or
both,
may
21


maintain
coverage
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
bill.
22


However,
if
the
coverage
is
maintained
by
a
driver,
a
TNC
shall
23


only
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
bill
if
the
TNC
verifies
24


that
the
policy
maintained
by
the
driver
is
explicitly
written
25


to
cover
injury,
damage,
and
loss
arising
from
the
driver’s
26


operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
in
connection
with
the
use
of
a
27


TNC’s
online-enabled
application
or
platform.
28


The
bill
provides
that
an
insurer
providing
TNC
insurance
29


shall
have
the
duty
to
defend
and
indemnify
the
insured.
In
30


addition,
TNC
insurance
shall
not
be
conditional
on
any
other
31


insurer
first
denying
a
claim,
or
a
claim
first
being
denied
32


pursuant
to
any
other
policy.
33


The

further
provides
that,
during
the
app-on
stage,
34


where
a
driver’s
insurance
lapses,
is
canceled,

beginning

In

in

with
the

of

10


The
bill
does
not
limit
the
liability
of
a
TNC
in
an
action
11


against
the
TNC
for
an
amount
greater
than
the
amount
of
12


coverage
required
by
the
bill.
13


In
order
to
provide
coverage
to
TNCs
and
drivers,
the
14


bill
requires
an
insurance
policy
to
explicitly
provide
15


coverage
during
the
app-on
stage,
the
engaged
stage,
and
the
16


passenger-on-board
stage.
If
the
policy
does
not,
the
insurer
17


does
not
have
a
duty
to
defend
or
indemnify
the
insured.
18


The
bill
provides
that
during
the

of
an

a

insurer
shall
cooperate
with
the
20


other
insurers
involved
in
the

to
facilitate
21


the
exchange
of
information,
and
shall
provide
information
22


requested
by
another
insurer
involved
in
the

23


within
15
days
of
a
written
request
from
the
insurer
to
the
TNC
24


or
the
TNC’s
insurer.
All
records,
data,
or
reports
kept
by
a
25


TNC
relating
to
a
motor
vehicle
accident
must
be
maintained
by
26


the
TNC
for
at
least
five
years
after
the
date
the
accident
is
27


reported
to
the
TNC.
28


The
bill
requires
a
driver
to
carry
proof
of
insurance
at
all
29


times
during
which
the
driver
is
operating
the
motor
vehicle
in
30


connection
with
the
use
of
a
TNC’s
online-enabled
application
31


or
platform.
In
the
event
of
an
accident,
a
driver
shall
32


provide
the

to
a
peace
officer
and
any
