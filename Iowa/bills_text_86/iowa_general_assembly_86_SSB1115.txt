reasons
to
amend

Division
VI
of
the
bill
relates
to
nuisance
properties
6


and
abandoned
buildings.
The
division
requires
the
economic
7


development
authority
to
establish
a
nuisance
property
8


remediation
fund
for
the
purpose
of
providing
financial
9


assistance
to
cities
for
the
remediation
of
nuisance
10


properties,
abandoned
buildings,
and
other

The

division
provides
that

in
a
fund
established
in
the
high
12


quality
jobs
program
may
be
deposited
in
the

The
division
allows
the

14


the

as
a
revolving
fund
and
to
use
moneys
in
the
fund
for
15


purposes
of
the
program,
or
the
authority
may
transfer
the
16


moneys
to
other

created.
However,
the
division
17


states
that
the
authority
must
use
any
money
specifically
18


appropriated
for
nuisance
property
remediation
assistance
for
19


the
program.
Moneys
in
the
fund
consist
of
appropriations
and
20


any
other
moneys
lawfully
available
to
the
authority.
The
21


authority
may
provide
this
assistance
using
a
competitive
22


scoring
process.
The
division
requires
the
authority
to
enter
23


into
an
agreement
with
the
city
concerning
the
assistance.
The
24


division
allows
the
authority
to
grant
priority
to
cities
with
25


severe
blighted

widespread
dilapidated
housing

or
26


high

In
lieu
of

through

rehabilitation,
Code
section
657A.10A
allows
a
city
to
file
2


an
action
in
district
court
to
take
title
to
an
abandoned
3


building.
The
court
may
award
title
to
the
petitioning
city
if
4


the
court
finds
that
the
building
is
abandoned,
using
factors
5


established
in
statute,
or
if
the
city
establishes
that
all
6


interested
parties
received
proper
notice
and
the
interested
7


parties
either
consented
to
the
title
transfer
or
had
taken
no
8


action
to
comply
with
local
housing
official
orders
within
60
9


days
after
the
filing
of
the
petition.
10


The
division
amends
the
definition
of
“building”
in
Code
11


section
657A.1
to
include
buildings
used
or
intended
to
be
used
12


for
commercial
or
industrial
purposes
and
makes
corresponding
13


amendments
to
refer
to
the
local
building
code
or
local
housing
14


code,
as
applicable.
15


Currently,
Code
section
657A.10A
requires
that
service
16


of
notice
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
title
be
made
17


on
interested
parties
by
certified
mail
and
by
posting
on
18


the
building.
The
division
provides
that
service
shall
be
19


by
personal
service
or
certified
mail
or,
if
service
cannot
20


be
made
by
either
method,
by
posting
on
the
building
and
21


publication
in
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
the
city.
22


The
division
also
amends
Code
section
657A.10A
to
add
to
the
23


listing
of
factors
for
the
court
to
consider
when
determining
24


whether
property
has
been
abandoned.
