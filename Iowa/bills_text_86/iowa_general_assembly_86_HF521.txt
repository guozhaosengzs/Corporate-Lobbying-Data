  3 21                           EXPLANATION
  3 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 24    This bill prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle
  3 25 while using a mobile telephone unless the mobile telephone
  3 26 is specifically designed and configured to allow hands=free
  3 27 listening and talking and is used in that manner.  The bill
  3 28 does not apply to the driver of a motor vehicle when the motor
  3 29 vehicle is at a complete stop off the roadway.  In addition,
  3 30 the bill exempts the following persons from the prohibition:  a
  3 31 member of a public safety agency performing official duties;
  3 32 a health care professional in the course of an emergency
  3 33 situation; and a person receiving safety=related information
  3 34 including emergency, traffic, or weather alerts.  These are the
  3 35 same exemptions that currently apply under Iowa law prohibiting
  4  1 text=messaging while driving.
  4  2    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same
  4  3 as defined in federal motor carrier safety administration
  4  4 regulations.  Under that definition, "mobile telephone" means
  4  5 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  4  6 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of
  4  7 the federal communications commission.  The federal definition
  4  8 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.
  4  9    The bill amends current provisions prohibiting
  4 10 text=messaging while driving to specify that a person does not
  4 11 violate the text=messaging provisions by using a fixed unit
  4 12 global positioning system or navigation system.  "Fixed unit
  4 13 global positioning system or navigation system" is defined as
  4 14 an electronic device mounted inside a motor vehicle and capable
  4 15 of providing navigation directions to a driver based on data
  4 16 entered into the device prior to operating the motor vehicle.
  4 17 The bill also strikes a current exception to the prohibition
  4 18 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
  4 19 selecting or entering a telephone number or name in a hand=held
  4 20 mobile telephone or activating, deactivating, or initiating a
  4 21 function of a hand=held mobile telephone.
  4 22    The penalties established in the bill mirror the penalties
  4 23 currently applicable for text=messaging while driving.  A
  4 24 person who uses a mobile telephone while driving in violation
  4 25 of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by
  4 26 a scheduled fine of $30.  The offense is not a moving
  4 27 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  4 28 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  4 29 habitual offender status.  However, if the violation causes a
  4 30 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  4 31 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  4 32 days, or both.  If the violation causes a death, a court could
  4 33 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  4 34 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
  4 35    The ban on the use of a hand=held mobile telephone while
  5  1 driving is enforceable only as a secondary action when a driver
  5  2 has been stopped or detained for a suspected violation of
  5  3 another law.  The bill does not authorize a peace officer to
  5  4 confiscate a mobile telephone from a driver or occupant of a
  5  5 motor vehicle.

  4  2    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same

  4  5 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  4  6 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of

  4  8 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.

  4 16 entered into the device prior to operating the motor vehicle.

  4 18 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
