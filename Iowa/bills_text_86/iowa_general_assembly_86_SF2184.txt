  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to notice requirements for the sale or
  4  1 other disposition of the real property of an estate under the
  4  2 Iowa probate code, methods of notice and document delivery
  4  3 under the Iowa trust code, the powers of an agent under a
  4  4 power of attorney, and liability for refusing to accept an
  4  5 acknowledged power of attorney.
  4  6    DIVISION I ==== NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SALE OF REAL PROPERTY
  4  7 OF AN ESTATE.  Under current law, a personal representative may
  4  8 petition a court to sell, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange
  4  9 property belonging to the decedent in order to pay debts of
  4 10 the estate, to distribute the estate, or for any other purpose
  4 11 which is in the best interests of the estate. For the sale,
  4 12 mortgage, exchange, or pledge of real property, or the lease
  4 13 of real property with a rental term exceeding one year, the
  4 14 personal representative is required to serve notice of such
  4 15 a petition on all persons interested in the property unless
  4 16 the right to receive notice is waived in writing. The bill
  4 17 provides that notice of the petition is not required if all
  4 18 interested persons are also personal representatives who have
  4 19 signed the petition.
  4 20    DIVISION II ==== TRUST CODE NOTICE AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY
  4 21 REQUIREMENTS.  The bill provides that notice and the sending
  4 22 of a document related to proceedings under the Iowa trust
  4 23 code (Code chapter 633A) shall be accomplished in a manner
  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to
  4 25 result in receipt of the notice or document. Permissible
  4 26 methods of notice and document delivery include first=class
  4 27 mail, personal delivery, and properly directed electronic mail.
  4 28 If notice is served via United States mail, service is made and
  4 29 completed when the notice is enclosed in a sealed envelope with
  4 30 proper postage paid, addressed to the interested party at the
  4 31 last known address, and deposited in a mail receptacle provided
  4 32 by the United States postal service.
  4 33    The bill provides that in the case of a proceeding against an
  4 34 unknown person whose address or whereabouts are unknown, the
  4 35 court shall prescribe that notice may be served by publication
  5  1 within the time and in the manner provided by the rules of
  5  2 civil procedure.
  5  3    The bill provides that a person entitled to notice or the
  5  4 receipt of documents under Code chapter 633A may waive such
  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.
  6 19    The bill's provisions relating to powers of attorney take

  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to notice requirements for the sale or
  4  1 other disposition of the real property of an estate under the
  4  2 Iowa probate code, methods of notice and document delivery
  4  3 under the Iowa trust code, the powers of an agent under a
  4  4 power of attorney, and liability for refusing to accept an
  4  5 acknowledged power of attorney.
  4  6    DIVISION I ==== NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SALE OF REAL PROPERTY
  4  7 OF AN ESTATE.  Under current law, a personal representative may
  4  8 petition a court to sell, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange
  4  9 property belonging to the decedent in order to pay debts of
  4 10 the estate, to distribute the estate, or for any other purpose
  4 11 which is in the best interests of the estate. For the sale,
  4 12 mortgage, exchange, or pledge of real property, or the lease
  4 13 of real property with a rental term exceeding one year, the
  4 14 personal representative is required to serve notice of such
  4 15 a petition on all persons interested in the property unless
  4 16 the right to receive notice is waived in writing. The bill
  4 17 provides that notice of the petition is not required if all
  4 18 interested persons are also personal representatives who have
  4 19 signed the petition.
  4 20    DIVISION II ==== TRUST CODE NOTICE AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY
  4 21 REQUIREMENTS.  The bill provides that notice and the sending
  4 22 of a document related to proceedings under the Iowa trust
  4 23 code (Code chapter 633A) shall be accomplished in a manner
  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to
  4 25 result in receipt of the notice or document. Permissible
  4 26 methods of notice and document delivery include first=class
  4 27 mail, personal delivery, and properly directed electronic mail.
  4 28 If notice is served via United States mail, service is made and
  4 29 completed when the notice is enclosed in a sealed envelope with
  4 30 proper postage paid, addressed to the interested party at the
  4 31 last known address, and deposited in a mail receptacle provided
  4 32 by the United States postal service.
  4 33    The bill provides that in the case of a proceeding against an
  4 34 unknown person whose address or whereabouts are unknown, the
  4 35 court shall prescribe that notice may be served by publication
  5  1 within the time and in the manner provided by the rules of
  5  2 civil procedure.
  5  3    The bill provides that a person entitled to notice or the
  5  4 receipt of documents under Code chapter 633A may waive such
  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.
  6 19    The bill's provisions relating to powers of attorney take

  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise

  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise

  4  8 petition a court to sell, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange
  4  9 property belonging to the decedent in order to pay debts of
  4 10 the estate, to distribute the estate, or for any other purpose
  4 11 which is in the best interests of the estate. For the sale,
  4 12 mortgage, exchange, or pledge of real property, or the lease
  4 13 of real property with a rental term exceeding one year, the
  4 14 personal representative is required to serve notice of such
  4 15 a petition on all persons interested in the property unless
  4 16 the right to receive notice is waived in writing. The bill
  4 17 provides that notice of the petition is not required if all
  4 18 interested persons are also personal representatives who have
  4 19 signed the petition.
  4 20    DIVISION II ==== TRUST CODE NOTICE AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY
  4 21 REQUIREMENTS.  The bill provides that notice and the sending
  4 22 of a document related to proceedings under the Iowa trust
  4 23 code (Code chapter 633A) shall be accomplished in a manner
  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to
  4 25 result in receipt of the notice or document. Permissible
  4 26 methods of notice and document delivery include first=class
  4 27 mail, personal delivery, and properly directed electronic mail.
  4 28 If notice is served via United States mail, service is made and
  4 29 completed when the notice is enclosed in a sealed envelope with
  4 30 proper postage paid, addressed to the interested party at the
  4 31 last known address, and deposited in a mail receptacle provided
  4 32 by the United States postal service.
  4 33    The bill provides that in the case of a proceeding against an
  4 34 unknown person whose address or whereabouts are unknown, the
  4 35 court shall prescribe that notice may be served by publication
  5  1 within the time and in the manner provided by the rules of
  5  2 civil procedure.
  5  3    The bill provides that a person entitled to notice or the
  5  4 receipt of documents under Code chapter 633A may waive such
  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.
  6 19    The bill's provisions relating to powers of attorney take

  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise

  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.
  6 19    The bill's provisions relating to powers of attorney take
  6 20 effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to July 1, 2014.

  4 12 mortgage, exchange, or pledge of real property, or the lease
  4 13 of real property with a rental term exceeding one year, the
  4 14 personal representative is required to serve notice of such
  4 15 a petition on all persons interested in the property unless

  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to

  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise

  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in

  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real

  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction

  4  5 acknowledged power of attorney.
  4  6    DIVISION I ==== NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SALE OF REAL PROPERTY
  4  7 OF AN ESTATE.  Under current law, a personal representative may
  4  8 petition a court to sell, mortgage, pledge, lease, or exchange
  4  9 property belonging to the decedent in order to pay debts of
  4 10 the estate, to distribute the estate, or for any other purpose
  4 11 which is in the best interests of the estate. For the sale,
  4 12 mortgage, exchange, or pledge of real property, or the lease
  4 13 of real property with a rental term exceeding one year, the
  4 14 personal representative is required to serve notice of such
  4 15 a petition on all persons interested in the property unless
  4 16 the right to receive notice is waived in writing. The bill
  4 17 provides that notice of the petition is not required if all
  4 18 interested persons are also personal representatives who have
  4 19 signed the petition.
  4 20    DIVISION II ==== TRUST CODE NOTICE AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY
  4 21 REQUIREMENTS.  The bill provides that notice and the sending
  4 22 of a document related to proceedings under the Iowa trust
  4 23 code (Code chapter 633A) shall be accomplished in a manner
  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to
  4 25 result in receipt of the notice or document. Permissible
  4 26 methods of notice and document delivery include first=class
  4 27 mail, personal delivery, and properly directed electronic mail.
  4 28 If notice is served via United States mail, service is made and
  4 29 completed when the notice is enclosed in a sealed envelope with
  4 30 proper postage paid, addressed to the interested party at the
  4 31 last known address, and deposited in a mail receptacle provided
  4 32 by the United States postal service.
  4 33    The bill provides that in the case of a proceeding against an
  4 34 unknown person whose address or whereabouts are unknown, the
  4 35 court shall prescribe that notice may be served by publication
  5  1 within the time and in the manner provided by the rules of
  5  2 civil procedure.
  5  3    The bill provides that a person entitled to notice or the
  5  4 receipt of documents under Code chapter 633A may waive such
  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.

  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in

  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to

  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.

  4 24 reasonably suitable under the circumstances and likely to

  4 30 proper postage paid, addressed to the interested party at the
  4 31 last known address, and deposited in a mail receptacle provided

  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction

  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create

  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to

  5  5 rights.
  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.
  6 19    The bill's provisions relating to powers of attorney take
  6 20 effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to July 1, 2014.

  5  6    DIVISION III ==== POWERS OF AN AGENT UNDER A POWER OF ATTORNEY
  5  7 ==== LIABILITY FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT AN ACKNOWLEDGED POWER OF
  5  8 ATTORNEY.  Under current law, if a person refuses to accept an
  5  9 acknowledged power of attorney, the person may be subject to
  5 10 liability for damages sustained by the principal for reasonable
  5 11 attorney fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding
  5 12 that confirms the validity of the power of attorney. The bill
  5 13 provides that a person who refuses to accept an acknowledged
  5 14 power of attorney may be subject to liability for damages and
  5 15 reasonable attorney fees and costs.
  5 16    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights
  5 23 under Code section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 24    Under current law, unless the power of attorney otherwise
  5 25 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 26 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 27 to, among other things, release, assign, satisfy, or enforce by
  5 28 litigation or otherwise, a mortgage, deed of trust, conditional
  5 29 sale contract, encumbrance, lien, or other claim to real
  5 30 property which exists or is asserted. The bill provides that
  5 31 such authority includes the right to the transfer or release
  5 32 of any and all of the principal's homestead rights under Code
  5 33 section 561.13 and Code chapter 597.
  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.

  5 17 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  5 18 authority with respect to real property authorizes the agent
  5 19 to, among other things, grant or dispose of an interest in
  5 20 real property or a right incident to real property. The bill
  5 21 provides that such authority includes the right to the transfer
  5 22 or release of any and all of the principal's homestead rights

  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the

  5 34    Under current Code section 633B.201, an agent's power to
  5 35 disclaim property must be specifically granted in the power of
  6  1 attorney. Under Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  2 "h", a grant of general authority with respect to estates,
  6  3 trusts, and other beneficial interests authorizes the agent to
  6  4 reject, renounce, disclaim, release, or consent to a reduction
  6  5 in or modification of a share in or payment from an estate,
  6  6 trust, or other beneficial interest. The bill strikes the
  6  7 general power in Code section 633B.211, subsection 2, paragraph
  6  8 "h", and therefore an agent cannot disclaim property on behalf
  6  9 of a principal unless the power of attorney specifically grants
  6 10 such power.
  6 11    The bill provides that, unless a power of attorney otherwise
  6 12 provides, language in a power of attorney granting general
  6 13 authority with respect to benefits from governmental programs
  6 14 or civil or military service authorizes the agent to create
  6 15 and fund a medical assistance income trust as defined in Code
  6 16 section 633C.1, also known as a "Miller trust", or a similar
  6 17 trust that is authorized under the applicable law of another
  6 18 jurisdiction in which the principal is a resident.

  6 20 effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to July 1, 2014.
