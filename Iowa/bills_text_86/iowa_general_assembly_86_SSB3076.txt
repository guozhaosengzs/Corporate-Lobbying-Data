the
explanation’s
substance
by

of
the
general
assembly.
1


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
the
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
2


Act”
codified
in
Code
chapter
490,
by
allowing
a
for-profit
3


corporation
to
either
incorporate
as
or
become
a
benefit
4


corporation
with
the
purpose
of
operating
in
a
responsible
and
5


sustainable
manner,
that
promotes
one
or
more
public
benefits,
6


and
that
operates
in
a
manner
that
considers
the
best
interests
7


of
persons
materially
affected
by
its
conduct
(new
Code
8


section
490.1801(1)).
A
public
benefit
may
be
of
an
artistic,
9


charitable,
cultural,
economic,
educational,
cultural,
10


literary,
religious,
social,
ecological,
or
scientific
nature
11


(new
Code
section
490.1801(2)).
Both
the
Code
chapter
and
the
12


bill’s
amendments
creating
new
division
XVIII
are
based
on
13


model
legislation
prepared
by
the
American
bar
association.
14


DECLARATION.
In
order
to
be
regarded
as
a
benefit
15


corporation,
the
corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
16


(articles)
must
include
a
public
benefit
provision
that
17


expressly
describes
the
corporation’s
public
benefit
(new
Code
18


section
490.1801(3)).
Moreover,
the
corporation’s
benefit
19


status
must
be
identified
in
its
corporate
name
(new
Code
20


section
490.1802).
Consequently,
a
professional
corporation
21


which
is
also
a
benefit
corporation
must
also
identify
itself
22


as
a
form
of
benefit
corporation
(amended
Code
section
496C.5).
23


In
addition,
stock
issued
by
the
benefit
corporation
must
state
24


its
benefit
status
(new
Code
section
490.1804),
as
must
any
25


shareholder
meeting
notice
(Code
section
490.1806(1)).
26


CHOICE
TO
FORM
AS
OR
BECOME
A
BENEFIT
ENTITY.
A
new


27


corporation
may
choose
to
form
as
a
benefit
corporation
at
28


the
time
of
incorporation
by
filing
its
articles
with
the
29


secretary
of
state,
and
an
existing
corporation
may
choose
to
30


become
a
benefit
corporation
by
amending
its
filed
articles.
31


An
existing
corporation
may
also
choose
to
become
a
benefit
32


corporation
by
combining
through
merger
or
share
exchange
33


with
a
benefit
corporation
or
similar
foreign
public
benefit
34


entity
(new
Code
section
490.1803(1)).

MANAGEMENT.
When
making
a
decision
affecting
the
business
11


affairs
of
a
benefit
corporation,
its
board
of
directors
12


must
balance
three
criteria:
its
public
benefit
provision,
13


the
best
interests
of
persons
materially
affected
by
the
14


benefit
corporation’s
conduct,
and
the
traditional
factor
15


of
its
stockholders’
pecuniary
interests
(new
Code
section
16


490.1805(1)).
A
director
does
not
have
a
duty
to
account
for
17


a
business
decision
(new
Code
section
490.1805(2)),
and
a
18


director’s
failure
to
consider
a
factor
does
not
constitute
19


an
intentional
infliction
of
harm
on
the
corporation
or
the
20


shareholders,
unless
otherwise
provided
in
the
corporation’s
21


articles
(new
Code
section
490.1805(3)).
However,
at
least
22


5
percent
of
the
corporation’s
shareholders
may
institute
a
23


derivative
suit
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
corporation’s
24


public
benefit
provision,
in
part
by
alleging
that
the
25


directors
failed
to
properly
perform
their
duties
(new
Code
26


section
490.1807).
27


REPORT.
The
benefit
corporation
must
prepare
and
deliver
a
28


report
to
shareholders
that
addresses
how
its
public
benefit
29


provision
is
being
promoted
and
persons
materially
affected
30


by
the
corporation’s
conduct
(new
Code
section
490.1806(2)).
31


The
benefit
corporation’s
directors
are
responsible
for
the
32


report’s
preparation,
unless
its
articles
require
involvement
33


by
a
third
party,
who
may
be
responsible
for
preparing
a
34


measurement
standard
or
certifying

490.1806(3)).
Similarly,
the
report
is
not
required
to
be
1


disclosed
to
the
public,
or
delivered
more
frequently
than
once
2


every
two
years,
unless
otherwise
specified
in
the
benefit
3


corporation’s
articles.
4


APPLICATION.
The
special
designation
of
a
corporation
as
a
5


benefit
corporation
does
not
by
itself
create
an
implication
6


that
different
rules
apply
to
nonbenefit
corporations.
7


However,
a
specific
provision
governing
a
benefit
corporation
8


also
does
not
affect
any
other
provision
that
applies
to
a
9


nonbenefit
corporation
unless
otherwise
expressly
stated.
