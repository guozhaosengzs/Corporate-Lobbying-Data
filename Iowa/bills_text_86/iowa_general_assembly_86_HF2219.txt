  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are
  9  7 approved by the commissioner of insurance.

  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy

  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent

  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are
  9  7 approved by the commissioner of insurance.

  6  5 This chapter shall not be deemed to invalidate or limit an

  6  9 individuals or property for compensation or vehicles available
  6 10 for hire by the public.
  6 11    b.  An insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim against an
  6 12 insured transportation network company driver that is excluded
  6 13 under the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right
  6 14 of action for contribution or indemnity against an insurer
  6 15 providing automobile insurance to the driver under this chapter
  6 16 during the period in which the loss occurred.
  6 17    3.  In a claims coverage investigation, any involved
  6 18 transportation network company and any insurer potentially
  6 19 providing coverage pursuant to this chapter shall cooperate to
  6 20 facilitate the exchange of relevant information with parties
  6 21 directly involved in the claim, and with any insurer of the
  6 22 transportation network company driver, where applicable,
  6 23 including but not limited to the precise times during which
  6 24 the driver logged on and off of the company's digital network
  6 25 in the twelve=hour period immediately preceding and in the
  6 26 twelve=hour period immediately following the accident that
  6 27 resulted in the claim, and shall disclose to one another a

  6 29 pursuant to this chapter, including any applicable limits and
  6 30 exclusions.

  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are
  9  7 approved by the commissioner of insurance.

  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.

  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing

  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a

  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action

  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are
  9  7 approved by the commissioner of insurance.

  6  2    2.  a.  An insurer that excludes coverage pursuant to
  6  3 subsection 1 shall not have a duty to defend or indemnify a

  6  9 individuals or property for compensation or vehicles available

  6 15 providing automobile insurance to the driver under this chapter
  6 16 during the period in which the loss occurred.
  6 17    3.  In a claims coverage investigation, any involved
  6 18 transportation network company and any insurer potentially
  6 19 providing coverage pursuant to this chapter shall cooperate to
  6 20 facilitate the exchange of relevant information with parties
  6 21 directly involved in the claim, and with any insurer of the
  6 22 transportation network company driver, where applicable,
  6 23 including but not limited to the precise times during which
  6 24 the driver logged on and off of the company's digital network
  6 25 in the twelve=hour period immediately preceding and in the
  6 26 twelve=hour period immediately following the accident that
  6 27 resulted in the claim, and shall disclose to one another a

  6 29 pursuant to this chapter, including any applicable limits and

  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a

  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing

  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus

  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.

  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing

  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a

  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy

  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.

  7  1                           EXPLANATION
  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which
  8 34 the loss occurred.
  8 35    In addition, the bill provides that in a claims coverage
  9  1 investigation, any involved TNC and any insurer potentially
  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
  9  4 claim.
  9  5    The provisions of the bill relating to financial
  9  6 responsibility do not apply until the required form filings are
  9  7 approved by the commissioner of insurance.

  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not

  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a

  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing

  7  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  4    This bill provides for the regulation of transportation
  7  5 network companies (TNCs). The bill defines "transportation
  7  6 network company" as an entity operating in this state that uses
  7  7 a digital network to connect TNC riders to TNC drivers who
  7  8 provide prearranged rides. The bill provides that a TNC is not
  7  9 deemed to control, direct, or manage a TNC driver that connects
  7 10 to the TNC's digital network, or the driver's personal vehicle,
  7 11 except as agreed to by the TNC and the driver pursuant to a
  7 12 written contract. The bill further defines "digital network",
  7 13 "personal vehicle", "prearranged ride", "transportation network
  7 14 company driver", and "transportation network company rider".
  7 15    The bill provides that during the period in which a TNC
  7 16 driver is logged on to a TNC's digital network and is available
  7 17 to receive requests for a prearranged ride, but is not
  7 18 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 19 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $50,000 for
  7 20 bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident,
  7 21 $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of two or more persons
  7 22 in any one accident, and $25,000 for injury to or destruction
  7 23 of property of others in any one accident. The bill further
  7 24 provides that during the period in which a TNC driver is
  7 25 providing a prearranged ride, primary automobile insurance
  7 26 shall cover the driver in the amount of at least $1 million for
  7 27 bodily injury to or death of one or more persons and injury to
  7 28 or destruction of property of others in any one accident. The
  7 29 insurance required by the bill may be maintained by the TNC
  7 30 driver, the TNC, or both.
  7 31    The bill provides that if the insurance maintained by a
  7 32 TNC driver lapses or does not provide coverage in the amounts
  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus
  8  6 lines insurer governed by Code chapter 515I.
  8  7    The bill requires that a TNC driver shall carry proof of
  8  8 financial liability coverage at all times during which the
  8  9 driver uses a vehicle in connection with the use of a TNC's
  8 10 digital network. In the event of an accident, the driver
  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing
  8 15 the types, amounts, terms, and limits of automobile insurance
  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a
  8 17 personal vehicle in connection with the use of the TNC's
  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under
  8 31 the terms of the driver's policy shall have a right of action
  8 32 for contribution or indemnity against an insurer providing
  8 33 automobile insurance to the driver during the period in which

  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the

  7 33 required by the bill, insurance maintained by a TNC shall
  7 34 provide the coverage beginning with the first dollar of a
  7 35 claim, and the TNC shall have a duty to defend the claim. In
  8  1 addition, insurance maintained by a TNC shall not be dependent
  8  2 on the insurer of a driver's personal vehicle first denying a
  8  3 claim.
  8  4    The insurance required by the bill shall be provided by an
  8  5 insurer governed by Code chapter 515 or 518, or by a surplus

  8 11 shall provide the proof of financial liability coverage, upon
  8 12 request, to any directly interested party or insurer, and to
  8 13 any investigating police officer.
  8 14    The bill requires a TNC to disclose to a driver in writing

  8 16 provided by the TNC to the driver while the driver uses a

  8 18 digital network, and the fact that the driver's own automobile
  8 19 insurance policy may not provide coverage while the driver
  8 20 is logged on to the TNC's digital network or is providing a
  8 21 prearranged ride.
  8 22    The bill provides that an insurer may exclude coverage
  8 23 afforded to an insured person under a policy issued to the
  8 24 owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any injury or loss
  8 25 that occurs while the insured is logged on to a TNC's digital
  8 26 network or while the insured is providing a prearranged ride.
  8 27 An insurer that excludes coverage in this way shall not have a
  8 28 duty to defend or indemnify a claim so excluded from a policy
  8 29 issued by the insurer. An insurer that defends or indemnifies
  8 30 a claim against an insured TNC driver that is excluded under

  9  2 providing coverage shall cooperate to facilitate the exchange
  9  3 of relevant information with parties directly involved in the
