  3 12                           EXPLANATION
  3 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 15    This bill permits electronic voter registration from the
  3 16 state commissioner of elections' internet site.
  3 17    The bill allows an eligible elector to apply to register
  3 18 to vote by electronic means by completing and submitting an
  3 19 electronic voter registration form provided on the internet
  3 20 site for the state commissioner of elections (secretary of
  3 21 state).
  3 22    The bill requires that an electronic voter registration
  3 23 form provide all information that is currently required on
  3 24 printed voter registration forms.  The bill also requires that
  3 25 a registrant seeking to use the electronic voter registration
  3 26 form have an Iowa driver's license, Iowa nonoperator's
  3 27 identification card, a social security number, or a unique
  3 28 identifying number assigned to the registrant for voter
  3 29 registration purposes.
  3 30    The bill requires that a registrant attest to a statement
  3 31 that lists each voter registration eligibility requirement,
  3 32 that the registrant meets all of the requirements, and
  3 33 acknowledges that the registrant must provide an electronic
  3 34 signature, consistent with the definition of that term in Code
  3 35 chapter 554D (electronic transactions ==== computer agreements)
  4  1 as part of the uniform electronic transactions Act. The bill
  4  2 further requires that a registrant sign the electronic voter
  4  3 registration form using such an electronic signature.
  4  4    The bill requires that the registrant authorize the
  4  5 state commissioner of elections to use the applicant's
  4  6 signature obtained from the department of transportation or a
  4  7 commissioner of registration for voter registration purposes.
  4  8 The state commissioner of elections is required to notify a
  4  9 registrant by mail within five business days if a copy of the
  4 10 registrant's signature cannot be obtained and is required to
  4 11 include a voter registration form with that notice.
  4 12    The bill requires that the state commissioner of elections
  4 13 verify that the Iowa driver's license, Iowa nonoperator's
  4 14 identification card,  last four numerals of the registrant's
  4 15 social security number, or unique identifying number, and date
  4 16 of birth provided by the registrant match the information
  4 17 contained in department of transportation records or in
  4 18 commissioner of registration records.  The bill requires the
  4 19 state commissioner of elections to transmit to the appropriate
  4 20 commissioner of registration a registrant's completed voter
  4 21 registration application and electronic signature not later
  4 22 than five business days after the date of submission of the
  4 23 application and signature.
  4 24    The bill requires that the electronic registration form be
  4 25 accompanied by a statement featured prominently in boldface
  4 26 capital letters informing the registrant of the penalty
  4 27 for providing false information on a voter registration
  4 28 application.
  4 29    The bill also requires that an electronic voter registration
  4 30 registrant who has not previously voted in an election for
  4 31 federal office in the county of registration must follow the
  4 32 voting requirements of Code section 48A.8 for registrants
  4 33 submitting applications by mail under current law and who have
  4 34 not previously voted in an election for federal office in the
  4 35 county of registration. These provisions under current law
  5  1 require that a mail registrant who has not previously voted in
  5  2 an election for federal office in the county of registration
  5  3 shall be required to provide identification documents when
  5  4 voting for the first time in the county, unless the registrant
  5  5 provided on the registration form the registrant's Iowa
  5  6 driver's license number, the registrant's Iowa nonoperator's
  5  7 identification card number, or the last four numerals of the
  5  8 registrant's social security number and such information
  5  9 provided matches an existing state or federal identification
  5 10 record with the same number, name, and date of birth.  Code
  5 11 section 48A.8 also provides that a registrant who votes in
  5 12 person at the polls or by absentee ballot at the commissioner's
  5 13 office or at a satellite voting station shall provide a form of
  5 14 identification specified in that Code section. Code section
  5 15 48A.8 also requires that if a registrant is voting for the
  5 16 first time following mail registration and votes an absentee
  5 17 ballot by mail, the registrant shall provide a photocopy of the
  5 18 identification document when returning the absentee ballot.
  5 19 Code section 48A.8 allows a registrant voting in person for the
  5 20 first time following submission of a registration form by mail
  5 21 to vote a provisional ballot if the voter does not provide the
  5 22 required identification documents.
  5 23    The bill extends the category for the crime of voter
  5 24 registration fraud to include fraudulent electronic
  5 25 registration. Registration fraud is a class "D" felony. A
  5 26 class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more than
  5 27 five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500.
  5 28    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016.

  4 33 submitting applications by mail under current law and who have

  5  2 an election for federal office in the county of registration
  5  3 shall be required to provide identification documents when
  5  4 voting for the first time in the county, unless the registrant

  5 16 first time following mail registration and votes an absentee
  5 17 ballot by mail, the registrant shall provide a photocopy of the
