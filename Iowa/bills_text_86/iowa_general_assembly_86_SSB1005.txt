EXPLANATION
4


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
5


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
6


This
bill
relates
to
the
reclassification
of
marijuana
7


including
tetrahydrocannabinols
and
the
possession
of
8


marijuana.
9


The
bill
reclassifies
marijuana,
including
10


tetrahydrocannabinols,
as
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
11


instead
of
a
schedule
I
controlled
substance
and
strikes
12


references
to
the
authority
of
the
board
of
pharmacy
to
adopt
13


rules
for
the
use
of
marijuana
or
tetrahydrocannabinols
for
14


medicinal
purposes.
15


A
schedule
I
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
16


substance
that
has
no
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
States
17


and
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
is
a
highly
addictive
18


substance
that
has
an
accepted
medical
use
in
the
United
19


States.
The
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
a
schedule
I
20


controlled
substance
to
a
schedule
II
controlled
substance
21


would
allow
a
physician
to
issue
a
prescription
for
marijuana
22


under
state
law.
However,
federal
regulations
may
prohibit
23


such
prescriptions.
24


Except
for
the
penalty
for
a
first-offense
possession
of
25


five
grams
or
less
of
marijuana,
the
penalties
remain
unchanged
26


for
violations
involving
marijuana
under
the
bill.
The
27


penalties
under
Code
section
124.401
range
from
a
class
“B”
28


felony
punishable
by
up
to
50
years
of
confinement
to
a
serious
29


misdemeanor
punishable
by
up
to
six
months
of
confinement
30


depending
on
the
amount
of
marijuana
involved
in
the
offense.
31


Under
the
bill,
a
person
who
possesses
five
grams
or
less
32


of
marijuana
commits
a
simple
misdemeanor
for
a
first
offense.
33


A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
34


than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
