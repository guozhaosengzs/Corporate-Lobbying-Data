  3  3    This bill modifies the statutory requirements for the
  3  4 establishment of the state percent of growth and the
  3  5 categorical state percent of growth for purposes of the school
  3  6 funding formula.
  3  7    Current law requires the state percent of growth and the
  3  8 categorical state percent of growth to each be established by
  3  9 statute within 30 days of the submission of the governor's
  3 10 budget in the year preceding the base year.
  3 11    The bill provides that if the statute establishing the
  3 12 state percent of growth is not enacted by March 1 immediately
  3 13 preceding the budget year, the state percent of growth for
  3 14 that budget year shall be the school finance inflation factor
  3 15 as determined in the bill.  The bill also establishes similar
  3 16 requirements for establishing the categorical state percent of
  3 17 growth for a budget year.
  3 18    Under the bill, the school finance inflation factor for a
  3 19 budget year is an index, expressed as a percentage rounded to
  3 20 the nearest one=hundredth of 1 percent, that is the average
  3 21 of the annual percentage change in the consumer price index
  3 22 for all urban consumers for the three completed calendar years
  3 23 immediately preceding the beginning of the budget year for
