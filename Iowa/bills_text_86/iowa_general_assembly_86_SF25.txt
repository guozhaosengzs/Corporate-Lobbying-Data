  1 15    1.  A city council or a county board of supervisors may
  1 16 provide by ordinance for an exemption from property taxation
  1 17 of the actual value added by improvements made to residential
  1 18 property if the property is deemed to be a public nuisance
  1 19 prior to the improvements.  A city council may provide for an
  1 20 exemption to such property located within the boundaries of
  1 21 the city and the county board of supervisors may provide for
  1 22 an exemption to such property located outside the boundaries
  1 23 of a city.
  1 24    2.  All property described in subsection 1 for which an
  1 25 exemption has been approved by ordinance is eligible to receive
  1 26 a one hundred percent exemption from taxation on the actual
  1 27 value added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a
  1 28 period of ten years beginning not later than the first year
  1 29 in which all improvements described in the application are
  1 30 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 31 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period
  2  5 of ten years.
  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been

  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased

  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.

  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  1 16 provide by ordinance for an exemption from property taxation
  1 17 of the actual value added by improvements made to residential
  1 18 property if the property is deemed to be a public nuisance
  1 19 prior to the improvements.  A city council may provide for an
  1 20 exemption to such property located within the boundaries of
  1 21 the city and the county board of supervisors may provide for
  1 22 an exemption to such property located outside the boundaries
  1 23 of a city.
  1 24    2.  All property described in subsection 1 for which an
  1 25 exemption has been approved by ordinance is eligible to receive
  1 26 a one hundred percent exemption from taxation on the actual
  1 27 value added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a
  1 28 period of ten years beginning not later than the first year
  1 29 in which all improvements described in the application are
  1 30 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 31 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period
  2  5 of ten years.
  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.

  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  1 20 exemption to such property located within the boundaries of
  1 21 the city and the county board of supervisors may provide for
  1 22 an exemption to such property located outside the boundaries
  1 23 of a city.
  1 24    2.  All property described in subsection 1 for which an
  1 25 exemption has been approved by ordinance is eligible to receive
  1 26 a one hundred percent exemption from taxation on the actual
  1 27 value added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a
  1 28 period of ten years beginning not later than the first year
  1 29 in which all improvements described in the application are
  1 30 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 31 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period

  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed

  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.

  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.

  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  1 30 first assessed for taxation.  A property tax exemption under
  1 31 this section shall not be granted if the property for which
  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that

  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period
  2  5 of ten years.
  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first

  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in

  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year

  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a

  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January

  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period

  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January

  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior

  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  1 32 the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
  1 33 exemption authorized by law for the actual value added to the
  1 34 property.
  1 35    3.  The ordinance approving the exemption from tax shall
  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period
  2  5 of ten years.
  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to

  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to

  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or

  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased

  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2  1 designate the length of time the exemption shall be available
  2  2 and may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of that
  2  3 provided in subsection 2.  However, an alternative exemption
  2  4 schedule specified in the resolution shall not exceed a period
  2  5 of ten years.
  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the

  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January

  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax

  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February

  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or

  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been

  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.

  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2  6    4.  a.  An application shall be filed for each new exemption
  2  7 claimed. The first application for an exemption shall be filed
  2  8 by the owner of the property with the governing body of the
  2  9 city or county in which the property is located by February
  2 10 1 of the assessment year for which the exemption is first
  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all

  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 11 claimed, but not later than the year in which all improvements
  2 12 included in the application are first assessed for taxation.
  2 13    b.  The application shall, at a minimum, contain the nature
  2 14 of the improvements, the cost of the improvements, and the
  2 15 estimated or actual date of completion of the improvements.
  2 16    c.  An owner may submit an application for an exemption
  2 17 under this section to the governing body of the city or
  2 18 county to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax
  2 19 exemption. Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner
  2 20 to exemption from taxation until the improvements have been
  2 21 completed, a physical review of the property has been conducted
  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.
  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.

  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 22 by the assessor pursuant to subsection 5, and the assessor has
  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until

  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 23 determined that the actual value of the property has increased
  2 24 as a result of the improvements.
  2 25    d.  If an application for an exemption is not approved, the
  2 26 owner may submit an amended application for the governing body
  2 27 to approve or reject.
  2 28    5.  The local assessor shall review each first=year
  2 29 application by making a physical review of the property to
  2 30 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  2 31 of the approved property. If the assessor determines that
  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to

  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  2 32 the actual value of that property has increased, the assessor
  2 33 shall proceed to determine the actual value of the property
  2 34 and certify the valuation to the county auditor at the time
  2 35 of transmitting the assessment rolls.  If an application for
  3  1 exemption is denied as a result of failure to increase the
  3  2 value of the property, the owner may, notwithstanding the
  3  3 filing deadlines in subsection 4, file a first application in a
  3  4 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  3  5 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  3  6 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  3  7 the assessor, for the time period specified in subsection 2, or
  3  8 specified in the different schedule if one has been adopted in
  3  9 the resolution of the governing body under which the exemption
  3 10 was granted.
  3 11    6.  When in the opinion of the city council or the county
  3 12 board of supervisors continuation of the exemption granted by
  3 13 this section ceases to be of benefit to the city or county, the
  3 14 city council or the county board of supervisors may repeal the
  3 15 ordinance, but all existing exemptions shall continue until
  3 16 their expiration.

  3 18 otherwise requires:

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption

  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value

  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all

  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  3 17    7.  For the purposes of this section, unless the context
  3 18 otherwise requires:
  3 19    a.  "Actual value added" means the actual value added as of
  3 20 the first year for which the exemption is received.
  3 21    b.  "Owner" includes a person who is purchasing property
  3 22 by installment contract or under a duly executed purchase
  3 23 contract.
  3 24    c.  "Public nuisance" means a building that is a menace to
  3 25 the public health, welfare, or safety, or that is structurally
  3 26 unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate safe egress,
  3 27 or that constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to
  3 28 human life, or that in relation to the existing use constitutes
  3 29 a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason
  3 30 of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or
  3 31 abandonment.
  3 32    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.7 shall not
  3 33 apply to the property tax exemption established in this Act.
  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.

  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive

  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or

  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill

  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.

  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of

  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill authorizes a city council or a county board of
  4  3 supervisors to provide by ordinance for an exemption from
  4  4 property taxation of the actual value added to residential
  4  5 property by improvements to the property if the property is
  4  6 deemed to be a public nuisance, as defined in the bill, prior
  4  7 to the improvements.
  4  8    If approved by the governing body of the city or the board of
  4  9 supervisors of a county, the property is eligible to receive
  4 10 a 100 percent exemption from taxation on the actual value
  4 11 added by the improvements.  The exemption is for a period of
  4 12 10 years beginning not later than the first year in which all
  4 13 improvements described in the application are first assessed
  4 14 for taxation.  The ordinance allowing the exemption from tax
  4 15 may provide for an exemption schedule in lieu of the 10=year
  4 16 exemption provided in the bill.  An alternative exemption
  4 17 schedule may not exceed a period of 10 years.
  4 18    The application for an exemption must be filed by the
  4 19 owner of the property with the governing body of the city or
  4 20 county in which the property is located by February 1 of the
  4 21 assessment year for which the exemption is first claimed, but
  4 22 not later than the year in which all improvements included in
  4 23 the application are first assessed for taxation. The bill
  4 24 authorizes an owner to submit an application for an exemption
  4 25 to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption.
  4 26 Such prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption
  4 27 from taxation until the improvements have been completed, a
  4 28 physical review of the property has been conducted by the
  4 29 assessor, and the assessor has determined that the actual value
  4 30 of the property has increased as a result of the improvements.
  4 31    The bill requires the assessor to review each first=year
  4 32 application by making a physical review of the property, to
  4 33 determine if the improvements made increased the actual value
  4 34 of the approved property. If an application for exemption
  4 35 is denied as a result of failure to increase the value of
  5  1 the property, the owner may file a first application in a
  5  2 subsequent year when additional improvements are made.  After
  5  3 the tax exemption is granted, the local assessor shall continue
  5  4 to grant the tax exemption, with periodic physical review by
  5  5 the assessor, for the time period authorized.
  5  6    Code section 25B.7 does not apply to the property tax
  5  7 exemption to the bill. Code section 25B.7 provides that for a
  5  8 property tax credit or exemption enacted on or after January
  5  9 1, 1997, if a state appropriation made to fund the credit
  5 10 or exemption is not sufficient to fully fund the credit or
  5 11 exemption, the political subdivision is required to extend
  5 12 to the taxpayer only that portion of the credit or exemption
  5 13 estimated by the department of revenue to be funded by the
  5 14 state appropriation.
