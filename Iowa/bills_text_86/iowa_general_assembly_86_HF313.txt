  6 35                           EXPLANATION
  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for pupils
  7  4 attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent private
  7  5 instruction and establishes an education savings grant fund.
  7  6    Under the bill, pupils eligible to enroll in grades
  7  7 kindergarten through 12 and attending a nonpublic school or
  7  8 receiving competent private instruction under Code chapter
  7  9 299A are eligible to receive an education savings grant for
  7 10 school years beginning on or after July 1, 2016.  By January 31
  7 11 preceding the school year for which the education savings grant
  7 12 is requested, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  7 13 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  7 14 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  7 15 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  7 16 provide competent private instruction for the pupil.
  7 17    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 18 year for which the education savings grant is requested,
  7 19 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 20 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 21 designated for the following school year to receive an
  7 22 education savings grant and the amount of the education savings
  7 23 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be
  7 24 approved for one school year and applications must be submitted
  7 25 for education savings grants in subsequent school years.
  7 26    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  7 27 statewide average state foundation aid per pupil in the same
  7 28 school year.
  7 29    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in the state
  7 30 treasury under the control of the department of management
  7 31 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department for the
  7 32 purpose of providing education savings grants.  For the fiscal
  7 33 year commencing July 1, 2016, and each succeeding fiscal year,
  7 34 there is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the
  7 35 department of management for deposit in the fund the amount
  8  1 necessary to pay all education savings grants approved for
  8  2 that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for an education
  8  3 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8  4 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8  5 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8  6 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8  7 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8  8 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8  9 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.
  8 10    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  8 11 contract with a private financial management firm to manage
  8 12 the education savings grant fund, in collaboration with the
  8 13 treasurer of state, including providing for the disbursement
  8 14 of education savings grants in the form of an electronic debit
  8 15 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  8 16 account within the fund.
  8 17    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 18 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 19 pupil's account within the education savings grant fund for
  8 20 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 21 years or for higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  8 22    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  8 23 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  8 24 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
  8 25 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
  8 26 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
  8 27 account in the fund until the pupil is 25 years old.  Until
  8 28 the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account may
  8 29 be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  8 30 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the
  8 31 pupil turns 25 years old are transferred by the department of
  8 32 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
  8 33    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim for
  8 34 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  8 35 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
  9  1 within the education savings grant fund without being legally
  9  2 entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and is
  9  3 subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows the department
  9  4 of management to initiate legal proceedings to recover grants
  9  5 and amounts improperly awarded or paid from accounts under the
  9  6 bill.
  9  7    The bill provides that moneys from an education savings
  9  8 grant under the bill are not taxable income under Code chapter
  9  9 422. In addition, the bill provides that contributions to an
  9 10 Iowa education savings plan trust account under Code chapter
  9 11 12D that are moneys from an education savings grant under the
  9 12 bill are not considered a contribution that may be deducted for
  9 13 Iowa income tax purposes.
  9 14    The bill applies to school budget years and fiscal years
  9 15 beginning on or after July 1, 2016.
  9 16    The provisions of the bill amending Code sections 12D.3 and

  7  3    This bill provides education savings grants for pupils
  7  4 attending a nonpublic school or receiving competent private
  7  5 instruction and establishes an education savings grant fund.
  7  6    Under the bill, pupils eligible to enroll in grades
  7  7 kindergarten through 12 and attending a nonpublic school or
  7  8 receiving competent private instruction under Code chapter
  7  9 299A are eligible to receive an education savings grant for
  7 10 school years beginning on or after July 1, 2016.  By January 31
  7 11 preceding the school year for which the education savings grant
  7 12 is requested, the parent or guardian of the pupil requesting to
  7 13 receive an education savings grant must submit an application
  7 14 to the department of education indicating that the parent or
  7 15 guardian intends to enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school or
  7 16 provide competent private instruction for the pupil.
  7 17    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 18 year for which the education savings grant is requested,
  7 19 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 20 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 21 designated for the following school year to receive an
  7 22 education savings grant and the amount of the education savings
  7 23 grant for each pupil.  Education savings grants may only be
  7 24 approved for one school year and applications must be submitted
  7 25 for education savings grants in subsequent school years.
  7 26    The amount of each education savings grant is equal to the
  7 27 statewide average state foundation aid per pupil in the same
  7 28 school year.
  7 29    The bill creates an education savings grant fund in the state
  7 30 treasury under the control of the department of management
  7 31 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department for the
  7 32 purpose of providing education savings grants.  For the fiscal
  7 33 year commencing July 1, 2016, and each succeeding fiscal year,
  7 34 there is appropriated from the general fund of the state to the
  7 35 department of management for deposit in the fund the amount

  8  2 that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for an education
  8  3 savings grant, the department of management must establish an
  8  4 account for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.
  8  5 The amount of the pupil's education savings grant is deposited
  8  6 into the pupil's account on July 1 and such amount is available
  8  7 for use by parents and guardians for the payment of qualified
  8  8 educational expenses, as defined in the bill, incurred by the
  8  9 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year.
  8 10    The bill authorizes the department of education to
  8 11 contract with a private financial management firm to manage

  8 15 card or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's
  8 16 account within the fund.
  8 17    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 18 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 19 pupil's account within the education savings grant fund for
  8 20 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 21 years or for higher education costs as authorized in the bill.
  8 22    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in
  8 23 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
  8 24 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
  8 25 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
  8 26 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
  8 27 account in the fund until the pupil is 25 years old.  Until
  8 28 the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account may
  8 29 be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
  8 30 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the

  8 34 the purpose of obtaining an education savings grant or who
  8 35 knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment from an account
