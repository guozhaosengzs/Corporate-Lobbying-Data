The
inclusion

the
explanation’s

by
the
members
of
the
general

5


This
bill
relates
to
the
approval
and
imposition
of
local
6


option
taxes.
Current
Code
chapter
423B
authorizes
the
7


imposition
of
local
option
taxes,
including
a
local
option
8


sales
and
services
tax.
Currently,
such
a
proposed
tax
is
9


only
presented
to
the
voters
of
a
whole
county
upon
the
filing
10


of
a
petition
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
the
county
equal
11


in
number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
the
county
who
voted
12


at
the
last
preceding
general
election
or
upon
receipt
by
the
13


county
commissioner
of
elections
of
motions
requesting
such
14


submission,
adopted
by
the
governing
bodies
of
the
cities
15


located
within
the
county
or
the
governing
body
of
the
county
16


for
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
representing
at
17


least
one-half
of
the
population
of
the
county.
18


The
bill
amends
the
methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
the
19


local
option
sales
and
services
tax
to
the
voters
of
certain
20


qualified
counties
by
allowing
the
eligible
electors
of
21


individual
cities
and
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
to
22


file
a
petition
for
an
election
to
be
held
in
the
petitioning
23


jurisdiction
if
such
petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
24


of
the
city
or
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
25


applicable,
equal
in
number
to
5
percent
of
the

in
26


the
applicable
city
or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
27


voted
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
The
bill
defines
28


“qualified
county”
to
mean
a
county
with
a
population
in
excess
29


of
400,000,
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
least
60,000
but

46,000
but
not
more
than
48,000,
according
to
the
2010
federal
32


decennial
census.
For
those
qualified
counties,
the
bill
also
33


removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
the
local
sales
34


and

specifies
that
except
for
purposes
of
allocating
7


local
sales
and
services
tax
receipts
based
on
the
county
in
8


which
the
tax
was
collected,
a
city
shall
be
deemed
to
be
9


located
in
a
qualified
county
if
a
majority
of
the
population
10


of
the
city,
according
to
the
2010
federal
decennial
census,
11


resides

a
qualified
county
a
city
or
the

board
of
supervisors
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
14


may
repeal
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
the
city
upon

adoption
of
its
own
motion
for
repeal.

counties
that
are
not

counties,
the
17


methods
of
seeking
presentment
of

local
option
sales
and
