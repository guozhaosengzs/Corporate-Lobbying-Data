EXPLANATION

The

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the

of

This
bill
relates
to
family
support
programs
including
child
9


support
and
establishment
of
paternity.
10


Division
I
of
the
bill
amends
provisions
in
Code
chapter
11


252K,
the
uniform
interstate
family
support
Act
(UIFSA).
12


UIFSA
provides
uniform
rules
for
the
enforcement
of
support
13


orders
including
by
setting
basic
jurisdictional
standards
for
14


state
courts,
determining
the
basis
for
a
state
to
exercise
15


continuing
jurisdiction
over
a
child
support
proceeding,
16


establishing
rules
for
determining
which
state
issues
the
17


controlling
order
if
proceedings
are
initiated
in
multiple
18


jurisdictions,
and
providing
rules
for
modifying
or
refusing
19


to
modify
another
state’s
child
support
order.
While
the
20


United
States
has
recognized
and
enforced
orders
from
other
21


countries,
the
same
reciprocity
has
not
always
been
available
22


when
parties
from
the
United
States
seek
enforcement
in
23


foreign
countries.
The
Hague
convention
on
the
international
24


recovery
of
child
support
and
other
forms
of
family
maintenance
25


extends
jurisdiction
and
enforcement
rules
to
facilitate
the
26


recognition
and
enforcement
of
the
orders
of
parties
from
27


the
United
States
seeking
enforcement
in
foreign
countries.
28


The
2008
amendments
to
UIFSA
are
designed
to
implement
these
29


improvements
and
help
ensure
that
more
family
support
orders
30


issued
in
the
United
States
are
recognized
and
enforced
abroad.
31


In
2007,
the
United
States
signed
the
Hague
convention
on
32


the
international
recovery
of
child
support
and
other
forms
33


of
family
maintenance.
In
July
2008,
the
national
conference
34


of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
approved
amendments

UIFSA
to
integrate
the
appropriate
provisions
of
the
Hague
1


convention.
The
2008
amendments
act
as
the
implementing
2


language
for
the
convention
in
the
states.
In
2014,
the
United
3


States
Congress
passed
federal
implementing
legislation
(the
4


federal
Preventing
Sex
Trafficking
and
Strengthening
Families
5


Act,
Pub.
L.
No.
113-183)
for
the
convention.
Under
this
6


federal
Act,
states
are
required
to
adopt
the
amendments
to
7


UIFSA
in
their
next
legislative
sessions,
but
have
a
grace
8


period
to
allow
for
state
law
changes.
States
must
enact
such

a
law
and
make
it
effective
no
later
than
the
first
day
of
the
10


first
calendar
quarter
beginning
after
the
close
of
the
first

regular

of

legislature
that
begins
after
12


September
29,
2014
(the
enactment
date
of
Pub.
L.
No.
113-183).
13


In
the
case
of
a
state
that
has
a
two-year
legislative
session,
14


each
year
of
the
session
is
considered
to
be
a
separate
regular
15


session
of
the
state
legislature.
The
new
law
requires
that
16


the
2008
UIFSA
amendments
be
enacted
in
every
jurisdiction
as
17


a
condition
for
continued
receipt
of
federal
funds
supporting

state
child
support
programs.
19


Division
I
of
the
bill
provides
definitions
including
those
20


for
“convention”,
“foreign
country”,
“foreign
tribunal”,
and
21


“record”.
The
bill
provides
for
changes
in
the
existing
22


Articles
1
through
6
of
the
UIFSA
law
and
provides
a
new

Article
7.
The
major
changes
in
the
law
include
specifying
24


that
a
foreign
tribunal
is
an
entity
of
a
foreign
country,
not
25


merely
a
jurisdiction
outside
of
the
state
and
that
a
“state”
26


means
only
a
state
or
territory
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
27


United
States
or
an
Indian
nation
or
tribe,
but
no
longer
28


includes
any
foreign
jurisdiction
that
has
enacted
a
law
or
29


established
the
procedures
of
or
comparable
to
UIFSA;
provides
30


specifically
when
the
Code
chapter
applies
to
a
foreign
country
31


or
foreign
support
proceedings;
and
otherwise
makes
technical
32


changes
and
adapts
language
of
the
convention
to
make
the
33


language
consistent.

Article

from

that
has
agreed
to

must

determines

of

Once

the

is

opportunity
to

Unless

Division

of

to
provide
for
the
suspension
of
child
support
upon
the
20


request
of
an
obligor,
if
certain
conditions
are
met.
The
bill
21


provides
that
if
the
child
support
recovery
unit
(CSRU)
is
22


providing
child
support
enforcement
services,
the
obligor
may
23


request
the
assistance
of
CSRU
in
suspending
the
obligation
for
24


support
if
the
child
is
currently
residing
with
the
obligor
and
25


has
been
residing
with
the
obligor
for
more
than

no
order
in

regarding
legal
custody,

physical
care,
visitation,

parenting
time
for

child;
it
is
reasonably
expected
that
the
basis
for
suspension
29


will
continue
for
not
less
than
six
months;
the
child
for

An

is
effective
upon

The

provides
the
process
for

if
an

exceeding

the

If
interpretative
rulemaking
authority
is
clearly
vested
17


in
an
agency,
the
standard
of
review
of
such
rules
is
18


whether
the
rules
constitute
an
irrational,
illogical,
or
19


wholly
unjustifiable
interpretation
of
law
(Code
section
20


17A.19(10)(l)).
If
interpretive
rulemaking
authority
is
21


clearly
not
vested
in
the
agency,
the
standard
of
review
22


of
such
rules
is
whether
the
rules
constitute
an
erroneous

interpretation

(Code

The
