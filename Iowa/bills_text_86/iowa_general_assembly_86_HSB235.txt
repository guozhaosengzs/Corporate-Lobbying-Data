This

either

a
producer
for

for
use
10


for

The

14


Additionally,
currently
the
Code

specifies
the

be
16


claimed
per
kilowatt-hour
of
electricity,
or
per

17


British
thermal
units
of
heat
for
a
commercial
purpose,
or
per

million
British
thermal

of
methane
gas
or
other
biogas
19


used
to
generate
electricity,
or
per
one
thousand
standard
20


cubic
feet
of
hydrogen
fuel.
The
bill
provides
that
a
producer
21


or
purchaser
of
renewable
energy
may
cumulate
renewable
energy
22


tax
credit
amounts
for
renewable
energy
produced
by
an
eligible
23


facility
and
renewable
energy
that
is
captured
as
a
byproduct
24


of
such
renewable
energy
production.
25


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
