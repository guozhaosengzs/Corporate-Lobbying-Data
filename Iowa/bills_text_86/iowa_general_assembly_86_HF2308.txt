  3 33    This bill allows a county or city to establish a pretrial
  3 34 diversion program for persons charged with or issued a citation
  3 35 for a minor traffic offense. The bill defines "minor traffic
  4  1 offense" as a violation of Code chapter 321 which is punishable
  4  2 as a simple misdemeanor or for which a scheduled fine is
  4  3 provided in Code section 805.8A, except for operating a motor
  4  4 vehicle without financial liability coverage, operating a motor
  4  5 vehicle with a suspended or revoked driver's license, leaving
  4  6 the scene of a traffic accident, passing a stopped school
  4  7 bus, reckless driving, careless driving, drag racing, eluding
  4  8 law enforcement, speeding 25 miles per hour or more over the
  4  9 speed limit, speeding 95 miles per hour or more, or any moving
  4 10 traffic violation that occurs within a road work zone or that

  4 12    A pretrial diversion program allows a person who is a
  4 13 resident of Iowa and who has been charged with or received a
  4 14 citation for a minor traffic offense to have the option to
  4 15 complete an internet=based class related to understanding the
  4 16 traffic laws of this state, the strategies available for the
  4 17 safe operation of motor vehicles, and the deterrence of future
  4 18 violations. Upon completion of the class, the person's charge
  4 19 or citation is dismissed. The person is required to pay the
  4 20 court costs associated with the person's charge or citation.
  4 21    The bill prohibits enrollment in the program from being
  4 22 conditioned on a plea of guilty by the person. A person may
  4 23 withdraw from the program at any time before the completion of
  4 24 the program.
  4 25    The bill requires a person to complete the program within
  4 26 90 days of being charged with or receiving a citation for a
  4 27 violation. If a person enrolls in but does not withdraw from
  4 28 or complete the program within 90 days, the person shall be
  4 29 remanded to the judicial process for the person's charge or
  4 30 citation, and the department of transportation (DOT) shall

  3 35 for a minor traffic offense. The bill defines "minor traffic
  4  1 offense" as a violation of Code chapter 321 which is punishable
  4  2 as a simple misdemeanor or for which a scheduled fine is

  4  5 vehicle with a suspended or revoked driver's license, leaving
  4  6 the scene of a traffic accident, passing a stopped school
  4  7 bus, reckless driving, careless driving, drag racing, eluding

  4 18 violations. Upon completion of the class, the person's charge
  4 19 or citation is dismissed. The person is required to pay the
  4 20 court costs associated with the person's charge or citation.
  4 21    The bill prohibits enrollment in the program from being

  3 33    This bill allows a county or city to establish a pretrial
  3 34 diversion program for persons charged with or issued a citation
  3 35 for a minor traffic offense. The bill defines "minor traffic
  4  1 offense" as a violation of Code chapter 321 which is punishable
  4  2 as a simple misdemeanor or for which a scheduled fine is
  4  3 provided in Code section 805.8A, except for operating a motor
  4  4 vehicle without financial liability coverage, operating a motor
  4  5 vehicle with a suspended or revoked driver's license, leaving
  4  6 the scene of a traffic accident, passing a stopped school
  4  7 bus, reckless driving, careless driving, drag racing, eluding
  4  8 law enforcement, speeding 25 miles per hour or more over the
  4  9 speed limit, speeding 95 miles per hour or more, or any moving
  4 10 traffic violation that occurs within a road work zone or that
  4 11 results in injury to or the death of another person.
  4 12    A pretrial diversion program allows a person who is a
  4 13 resident of Iowa and who has been charged with or received a
  4 14 citation for a minor traffic offense to have the option to
  4 15 complete an internet=based class related to understanding the
  4 16 traffic laws of this state, the strategies available for the
  4 17 safe operation of motor vehicles, and the deterrence of future
  4 18 violations. Upon completion of the class, the person's charge
  4 19 or citation is dismissed. The person is required to pay the
  4 20 court costs associated with the person's charge or citation.
  4 21    The bill prohibits enrollment in the program from being
  4 22 conditioned on a plea of guilty by the person. A person may
  4 23 withdraw from the program at any time before the completion of
  4 24 the program.
  4 25    The bill requires a person to complete the program within
  4 26 90 days of being charged with or receiving a citation for a

  4 29 remanded to the judicial process for the person's charge or
  4 30 citation, and the department of transportation (DOT) shall

  5  8 administrator for such access in an amount sufficient to cover

  3 35 for a minor traffic offense. The bill defines "minor traffic
  4  1 offense" as a violation of Code chapter 321 which is punishable
  4  2 as a simple misdemeanor or for which a scheduled fine is
  4  3 provided in Code section 805.8A, except for operating a motor

  4 19 or citation is dismissed. The person is required to pay the
  4 20 court costs associated with the person's charge or citation.
  4 21    The bill prohibits enrollment in the program from being

  3 33    This bill allows a county or city to establish a pretrial
  3 34 diversion program for persons charged with or issued a citation
  3 35 for a minor traffic offense. The bill defines "minor traffic
  4  1 offense" as a violation of Code chapter 321 which is punishable
  4  2 as a simple misdemeanor or for which a scheduled fine is
  4  3 provided in Code section 805.8A, except for operating a motor
  4  4 vehicle without financial liability coverage, operating a motor
  4  5 vehicle with a suspended or revoked driver's license, leaving
  4  6 the scene of a traffic accident, passing a stopped school
  4  7 bus, reckless driving, careless driving, drag racing, eluding
  4  8 law enforcement, speeding 25 miles per hour or more over the
  4  9 speed limit, speeding 95 miles per hour or more, or any moving
  4 10 traffic violation that occurs within a road work zone or that
  4 11 results in injury to or the death of another person.
  4 12    A pretrial diversion program allows a person who is a
  4 13 resident of Iowa and who has been charged with or received a
  4 14 citation for a minor traffic offense to have the option to
  4 15 complete an internet=based class related to understanding the
  4 16 traffic laws of this state, the strategies available for the
  4 17 safe operation of motor vehicles, and the deterrence of future
  4 18 violations. Upon completion of the class, the person's charge
  4 19 or citation is dismissed. The person is required to pay the
  4 20 court costs associated with the person's charge or citation.
  4 21    The bill prohibits enrollment in the program from being
  4 22 conditioned on a plea of guilty by the person. A person may
  4 23 withdraw from the program at any time before the completion of
  4 24 the program.
  4 25    The bill requires a person to complete the program within
  4 26 90 days of being charged with or receiving a citation for a

  4 29 remanded to the judicial process for the person's charge or
  4 30 citation, and the department of transportation (DOT) shall
