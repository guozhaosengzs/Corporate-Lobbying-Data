  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of

  4 30 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  4 31 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of
  4 26 education to grant to a cluster a three=year exemption from one
  4 27 or more of the teacher probation, evaluation, employment, and

  4 29    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  4 30 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  4 31 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  4 32 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  4 33 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  4 34 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  4 35 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5  1 The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  6 19 probation, evaluation, employment, and due process requirements
  6 20 and provisions of Code chapter 279.

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of

  4 29    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  4 30 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  4 31 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  4 32 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  4 33 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  4 34 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  4 35 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5  1 The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the
  5  2 instructional staff who may or may not be licensed under Code
  5  3 chapter 272 and who is employed by the school district to
  5  4 provide instruction in the cluster on a part=time or full=time
  5  5 basis.

  5  7 quality demonstration pilot project requirements and the

  5 18 each cluster must meet, including but not limited to multiple

  5 29 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  5 30 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill

  6 14 provisions that the department is requested to waive.
  6 15    THREE=YEAR STATUTORY AND RULE EXEMPTION AUTHORITY.  The bill

  6 17 20 to authorize the department to grant a three=year renewable
  6 18 exemption to the cluster from one or more of the teacher
  6 19 probation, evaluation, employment, and due process requirements
  6 20 and provisions of Code chapter 279.

  6 18 exemption to the cluster from one or more of the teacher
  6 19 probation, evaluation, employment, and due process requirements
  6 20 and provisions of Code chapter 279.

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of
  4 26 education to grant to a cluster a three=year exemption from one
  4 27 or more of the teacher probation, evaluation, employment, and
  4 28 due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279.
  4 29    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  4 30 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  4 31 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  4 32 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  4 33 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  4 34 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  4 35 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5  1 The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the
  5  2 instructional staff who may or may not be licensed under Code

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of

  4 33 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  4 34 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  4 35 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5  1 The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  4 23    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  4 24 demonstration pilot projects by clusters of attendance centers
  4 25 within a school district and authorizes the department of

  4 29    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  4 30 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to

  5 15 withdraws its approval, waivers and exceptions granted for
  5 16 purposes of the pilot project are revoked.
