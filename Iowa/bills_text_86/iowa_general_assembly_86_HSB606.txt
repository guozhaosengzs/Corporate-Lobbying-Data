LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS
——
PURPOSE.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
operating
a
motor
vehicle
2


in
this
state
is
a
privilege,
not
a
right.
A
person
who
wishes
3


to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
this
privilege
shall
accept
the
4


corresponding
responsibilities.

2.
The

of
this
6


Act
is
to
do
all
of
the
following:
7


a.
Protect
the
public
health
and
welfare
by
reducing
the
8


number
of
people
on
the
highways
of
this
state
who
operate
a
9


motor
vehicle
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
or
a
controlled
10


substance.
11


b.
Protect
the
public
health
and
welfare
by
reducing
the
12


number
of
repeat
offenders
who
commit
crimes
in
which
the
abuse
13


of
alcohol
or
a
controlled
substance
is
a
contributing
factor
14


in
the
commission
of
the
crime.
15


c.
Strengthen
the
pretrial
and
post-trial
options
available
16


to
prosecutors
and
judges
in
responding
to
repeat
offenders
who
17


commit
crimes
in
which
the
abuse
of
alcohol
or
a
controlled
18


substance
is
a
contributing
factor
in
the
commission
of
the
19


crime.
20


d.
Assure
the
timely
and
sober
participation
of
offenders
21


in
judicial
proceedings.
22


3.
The
general
assembly
declares
that
it
is
important
to
23


have
a
centralized
repository
for
all
information
related
to
24


alcohol
and
controlled
substance
testing
required
by
the
laws
25


of
this
state
or
as
a

a
court
or
governmental
entity,
as
a
condition
1


of
bond,
sentence,
probation,
parole,
or
a
work
permit,
may
2


require
a
person
who
has
been
charged
with,
pled
guilty
to,
3


or
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
which
the
abuse
of
alcohol
or
4


a
controlled
substance
was
a
contributing
factor,
including
a
5


second
or
subsequent
offense
of
operating
while
intoxicated
6


(OWI),
to
abstain
from
alcohol
and
controlled
substances
for
7


a
period
of
time.
8


The
program
requires
a
person
to
be
subject
to
testing
to
9


determine
whether
alcohol
or
a
controlled
substance
is
present
10


in
the
person’s
body
at
least
twice
per
day
at
a
central
11


location
where
an
immediate
sanction
can
be
applied.
Where
12


such
testing
creates
a
documented
hardship
or
is
geographically
13


impractical,
an
alternative
method
approved
by
DPS
may
be
used.
14


Hardship
or
geographic
impracticality
is
determined
by
15


documentation
and
consideration
of
whether
a
testing
device
is
16


available,
whether
the
participant
is
capable
of
paying
the
17


fees
and
costs
associated
with
the
testing
device,
whether
18


the
participant
is
capable
of
wearing
the
testing
device,
and
19


whether
the
participant
fails
to
qualify
for
testing
twice
20


per
day
because
the
participant
lives
in
a
rural
area,
the
21


participant’s
employment
requires
the
participant’s
presence
at
22


a
location
remote
from
the
testing
location,
or
the
participant
23


has
repeatedly
violated
the
requirements
of
the
program.
24


The
bill
requires
the
program
to
be
evidence-based.
25


If
a
jurisdiction
chooses
to
participate
in
the
program,
DPS
26


shall
assist
the
jurisdiction
in
setting
up
and
administering
27


the
program.
The
participating
jurisdiction
shall
establish
28


testing
locations
and
may
designate
a
third
party
to
provide
29


testing
services.
30


Any
efforts
by
DPS
to
alter
or
modify
the
core
components
31


of
the
program
are
required
to
include
a
documented
strategy
32


for
achieving
and
measuring
the
effectiveness
of
the
planned
33


alteration
or
modification.
Before
the
core
components
of
the

program
can

providing

the
creation

group
to

to
the
program.
8


The
bill
requires
the
amount
of
the
fees
to
be
set
at
9


an
amount
such
that
the

collected
in
a

10


jurisdiction
are
sufficient
to

for
the

of
the

11


in

jurisdiction,
including
all

The

further
requires

and
approve
14


the

of
a

data
management
system
to

data
access,

the
collection
of

17


payments,

the

collection
of
any
required

The
bill
provides
for
certain
required

the

A

or
a
governmental
entity
in
a

jurisdiction
may
utilize
the

A
court
may

otherwise
authorized

for
23


a
person
charged

or
with
any

A
