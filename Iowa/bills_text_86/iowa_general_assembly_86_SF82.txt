  2 11    Under current law, meetings of a governmental body under
  2 12 Iowa's open meetings law (Code chapter 21) are required to be
  2 13 preceded by public notice and shall be held in open session.
  2 14 A governmental body may hold a closed session under certain
  2 15 circumstances and the minutes and audio recording of a closed
  2 16 session are not accessible to the public unless the person
  2 17 seeking access to the records files an action in court.
  2 18    This bill provides that the Iowa public information board
  2 19 is not required to obtain a court order to examine the minutes
  2 20 and audio recording of a closed session for the purpose
  2 21 of resolving complaints alleging violations of Iowa's open
  2 22 meetings law. Similarly, the office of ombudsman is not
  2 23 required to obtain a court order to examine the minutes and
  2 24 audio recording of a closed session when such examination is
  2 25 relevant to an investigation under Code chapter 2C (ombudsman's
  2 26 office) and the information is not available through other
  2 27 means.
