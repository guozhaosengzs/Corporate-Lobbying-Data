  2  4                           EXPLANATION
  2  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  7    Current Code section 298.2 authorizes a physical plant and
  2  8 equipment levy of not exceeding $1.67 per $1,000 of assessed
  2  9 valuation in the district. The physical plant and equipment
  2 10 levy consists of the regular physical plant and equipment levy
  2 11 of not exceeding $0.33 per $1,000 of assessed valuation in the
  2 12 district and a voter=approved physical plant and equipment
  2 13 levy of not exceeding $1.34 per $1,000 of assessed valuation
  2 14 in the district. However, the voter=approved physical plant
  2 15 and equipment levy may consist of a combination of a physical
  2 16 plant and equipment property tax levy and a physical plant and
  2 17 equipment income surtax. In anticipation of revenues received
  2 18 from the physical plant and equipment levy, Code section 297.36
  2 19 authorizes school districts to borrow money and enter into loan
  2 20 agreements.
  2 21    This bill provides that for school budget years beginning
