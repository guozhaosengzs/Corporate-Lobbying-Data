  1 24    This bill relates to employee residency qualifications in
  1 25 cities with a civil service commission.
  1 26    Current law prohibits cities operating with a civil service
  1 27 commission from requiring employees to reside in the city in
  1 28 which they are employed, but requires that such employees
  1 29 become residents of the state within two years of appointment
  1 30 or the date employment begins. Current law does, however,
  1 31 provide that cities may set a reasonable maximum distance
  1 32 outside of the corporate limits of the city, or a reasonable
  1 33 maximum travel time, that police officers, fire fighters,
  1 34 and other critical employees may live from their place of
  1 35 employment. Current law further requires that an employee
  2  1 hired from out of state take reasonable steps to become a
  2  2 resident of the state as soon as practicable.
  2  3    The bill provides that each city with a civil service
  2  4 commission may establish a policy to provide individual
  2  5 exemptions from these provisions due to individual hardship
  2  6 and upon a determination by the civil service commission that
  2  7 granting an individual exemption is not contrary to the public
