substance
by

21


BILL.
This
bill
would
require
parties
to
a
lease
for
land
22


used
in
farming
to
make
any
agreement
terminating
the
lease
in
23


writing.
24


BACKGROUND.
A
farm
tenancy
is
a
type
of
lease
in
which
25


the
lessor
receives
some
form
of
rent
from
a
lessee
who
uses
26


the
leased
land
to
produce
crops
or
livestock.
The
relevant
27


statutes
refer
to
the
lessee
as
the
“farm
tenant”
and
the
28


farm’s
tenant’s
leasehold
interest
as
a
“farm
tenancy”
(see
29


Code
section
562.1A).
The
lease
may
be
made
either
in
writing
30


or
orally.
Generally,
all
farm
tenancies
terminate
on
March
31


1
at
the
end
of
the
farm
tenant’s
crop
year.
However,
in
32


order
to
effectuate
the
termination,
one
party
to
the
lease
33


must
have
given
the
other
party
written
notice
of
termination
34


by
the
previous
September
1
(Code
sections
562.5
through
35

562.7).
Without
such
timely
written
notice
of
the
termination,
1


the
lease
automatically
continues,
under
its
same
terms
and
2


conditions.
The
following
September
1
is
the
latest
date
3


that
a
party
may
again
exercise
a
right
of
termination
by
4


written
notice
effective
the
following
first
day
of
March.
One
5


exception
to
the
written
notice
requirement
allows
the
parties
6


to
agree
to
the
termination
either
in
writing
or
orally.
The
7


parties
may
make
the
agreement
any
time
during
the
term
of
the
8


lease,
and
the
agreement
may
provide
for
a
termination
date
9


earlier
than
March
1.
10


The
bill,
in
part,
is
a
response
to
the
Iowa
Court
of
11


Appeals’
decision
in
Auen
v.
Auen,
851
N.W.2d
547
(Iowa
Ct.
12


App.
2014).
