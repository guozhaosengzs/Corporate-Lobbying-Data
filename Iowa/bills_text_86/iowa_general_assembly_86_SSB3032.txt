S.F.
_____


This
bill
makes
changes
to
Code
section
649.5,
relating
1


to
attorney
fees
and
court
costs
for
a
party
who
succeeds
in
2


an
action
to
quiet
title
and
who
requested
a
quitclaim
deed
3


from
the
party
holding
an
apparent
adverse
interest
prior
to
4


bringing
the
action
to
quiet
title.
5


Under
current
law,
if
the
defendant
in
an
action
to
quiet
6


title
appears
before
the
court
and
disclaims
all
right
and
7


title
adverse
to
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
recovers
the
8


defendant’s
costs.
However,
if
20
days
prior
to
bringing
9


suit,
the
party
seeking
to
quiet
title
requests
a
quitclaim
10


deed
from
the
party
holding
an
apparent
adverse
interest,
and
11


the
adverse
party
refuses
to
deliver
the
requested
quitclaim
12


deed,
the
adverse
party
cannot
avoid
the
costs
of
the
action
13


by
disclaiming
all
right
and
title
in
the
property.
Instead,
14


if
the
plaintiff
succeeds,
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
15


assess
the
ordinary
costs
of
court
and
an
attorney
fee
for
the
16


plaintiff’s
attorney.
The
attorney
fee
cannot
exceed
$25
if
17


the
property
in
dispute
is
only
a
single
tract
not
exceeding
18


40
acres
or
is
a
single
lot
in
a
city.
The
attorney
fee
cannot
19


exceed
$40
if
the
property
in
dispute
is
only
a
single
tract
20


greater
than
40
acres
but
less
than
80
acres.
If
the
property
21


is
two
or
more
tracts
which
are
not
contained
in
a
single
22


description,
or
a
single
tract
covering
more
than
80
acres,
23


or
two
or
more
city
lots,
the
attorney
fee
is
a
reasonable
24


fee,
not
to
exceed,
proportionally,
the
attorney
fees
with
a
25


specified
dollar
amount.
26


The
bill
amends
current
law
to
specify
that
the
court
may
27


assess
a
reasonable
attorney
fee,
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
28


property
or
the
number
of
tracts
or
lots.
29


Under
current
law,
when
a
party
requests
a
quitclaim
deed,
30


the
party
must
provide
$1.25
to
the
person
with
an
apparent
31


adverse
interest
to
cover
the
expense
of
the
execution
and
32


delivery
of
the
deed.
The
bill
provides
that
the
party
33


requesting
the
quitclaim
deed
provide
$50
to
the
person
with
34


an
apparent
adverse
interest
to
cover
the
expense
of
the

for
the
quitclaim
2


deed
to
do
so
in
writing,
and
to

in
