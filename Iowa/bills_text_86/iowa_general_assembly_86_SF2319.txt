  9  6 on a wait list pursuant to subsection 8, the taxpayer must
  9  7 claim the tax credit beginning with the tax year that the tax
  9  8 credit certificate is issued.

  9  7 claim the tax credit beginning with the tax year that the tax
  9  8 credit certificate is issued.
  9  9    12.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability

  8 22 is used by a business for its own vehicle fleet or employees.
  8 23 The tax credit must be taken in equal installments in three
  8 24 consecutive tax years, beginning with the tax year that the
  8 25 taxpayer completed installation of the alternative  fuel vehicle
  8 26 facility.  However, if the taxpayer's application for a tax
  8 27 credit certificate was placed on a wait list pursuant to
  8 28 subsection 8, the taxpayer must claim the tax credit beginning
  8 29 with the tax year that the tax credit certificate is issued.

  9  2 primary residence. The entire amount of the tax credit
  9  3 must be claimed in the tax year that the taxpayer completed
  9  4 installation of the electric vehicle facility. However, if the
  9  5 taxpayer's application for a tax credit certificate was placed
  9  6 on a wait list pursuant to subsection 8, the taxpayer must
  9  7 claim the tax credit beginning with the tax year that the tax
  9  8 credit certificate is issued.
  9  9    12.  Any tax credit in excess of the taxpayer's tax liability
  9 10 shall be refunded. In lieu of claiming a refund, the taxpayer
  9 11 may elect to have the overpayment shown on the taxpayer's

 10 29                           EXPLANATION
 10 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill creates an alternative fuel vehicle facility
 10 33 tax credit for an electric vehicle facility, a (compressed)
 10 34 natural gas vehicle facility, and a liquid propane gas vehicle
 10 35 facility.  The tax credit is administered by the department of
 11  1 revenue.  A taxpayer may claim the tax credit for an electric
 11  2 vehicle facility on an agricultural, commercial, or residential
 11  3 basis and may claim the tax credit for a natural gas facility
 11  4 or liquid propane gas facility on an agricultural or commercial
 11  5 basis.  The amount of the tax credit that a taxpayer may claim
 11  6 is limited to 30 percent of the cost of purchasing and 30
 11  7 percent of the cost of installing the facility.  A taxpayer
 11  8 claiming the tax credit on a residential basis must claim the
 11  9 entire tax credit for the tax year in which the facility was
 11 10 installed.  The taxpayer must install the facility between
 11 11 January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019.  The aggregate amount
 11 12 of tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot exceed
 11 13 a total amount of $5 million for all tax years that the tax
 11 14 credit is available.  That total amount is divided into three
 11 15 reserved amounts:  (1) $2 million allocated for electric
 11 16 vehicle facilities, (2) $2 million allocated for natural gas
 11 17 facilities, and (3) $1 million allocated for liquid propane gas
 11 18 facilities.
 11 19    The department is to issue tax credit certificates on a
 11 20 first=come, first=served basis.  If moneys are no longer
 11 21 available from a reserved amount, the taxpayer's application
 11 22 for a tax credit certificate is to be placed on a waitlist. On
 11 23 and after January 1, 2019, the aggregate amount of tax credit
 11 24 certificates that have not been issued to taxpayers for liquid
 11 25 propane gas vehicle facilities are available to be issued to
 11 26 taxpayers for installations of all alternative fuel vehicle
 11 27 facilities completed between January 1, 2017, and December
 11 28 31, 2019.  If a taxpayer's application for a tax credit

 10 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 32    This bill creates an alternative fuel vehicle facility
 10 33 tax credit for an electric vehicle facility, a (compressed)
 10 34 natural gas vehicle facility, and a liquid propane gas vehicle
 10 35 facility.  The tax credit is administered by the department of
 11  1 revenue.  A taxpayer may claim the tax credit for an electric
 11  2 vehicle facility on an agricultural, commercial, or residential
 11  3 basis and may claim the tax credit for a natural gas facility
 11  4 or liquid propane gas facility on an agricultural or commercial
 11  5 basis.  The amount of the tax credit that a taxpayer may claim
 11  6 is limited to 30 percent of the cost of purchasing and 30
 11  7 percent of the cost of installing the facility.  A taxpayer
 11  8 claiming the tax credit on a residential basis must claim the
 11  9 entire tax credit for the tax year in which the facility was
 11 10 installed.  The taxpayer must install the facility between
 11 11 January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019.  The aggregate amount
 11 12 of tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot exceed
 11 13 a total amount of $5 million for all tax years that the tax
 11 14 credit is available.  That total amount is divided into three
 11 15 reserved amounts:  (1) $2 million allocated for electric
 11 16 vehicle facilities, (2) $2 million allocated for natural gas
 11 17 facilities, and (3) $1 million allocated for liquid propane gas
 11 18 facilities.
 11 19    The department is to issue tax credit certificates on a
 11 20 first=come, first=served basis.  If moneys are no longer
 11 21 available from a reserved amount, the taxpayer's application
 11 22 for a tax credit certificate is to be placed on a waitlist. On
 11 23 and after January 1, 2019, the aggregate amount of tax credit
 11 24 certificates that have not been issued to taxpayers for liquid
 11 25 propane gas vehicle facilities are available to be issued to

 10 32    This bill creates an alternative fuel vehicle facility
 10 33 tax credit for an electric vehicle facility, a (compressed)
 10 34 natural gas vehicle facility, and a liquid propane gas vehicle
 10 35 facility.  The tax credit is administered by the department of
 11  1 revenue.  A taxpayer may claim the tax credit for an electric
 11  2 vehicle facility on an agricultural, commercial, or residential
 11  3 basis and may claim the tax credit for a natural gas facility
 11  4 or liquid propane gas facility on an agricultural or commercial
 11  5 basis.  The amount of the tax credit that a taxpayer may claim
 11  6 is limited to 30 percent of the cost of purchasing and 30
 11  7 percent of the cost of installing the facility.  A taxpayer
 11  8 claiming the tax credit on a residential basis must claim the
 11  9 entire tax credit for the tax year in which the facility was
 11 10 installed.  The taxpayer must install the facility between
 11 11 January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019.  The aggregate amount
 11 12 of tax credit certificates that may be issued cannot exceed
 11 13 a total amount of $5 million for all tax years that the tax
 11 14 credit is available.  That total amount is divided into three
 11 15 reserved amounts:  (1) $2 million allocated for electric
 11 16 vehicle facilities, (2) $2 million allocated for natural gas
 11 17 facilities, and (3) $1 million allocated for liquid propane gas
 11 18 facilities.
 11 19    The department is to issue tax credit certificates on a
 11 20 first=come, first=served basis.  If moneys are no longer
 11 21 available from a reserved amount, the taxpayer's application

 11 23 and after January 1, 2019, the aggregate amount of tax credit
 11 24 certificates that have not been issued to taxpayers for liquid
 11 25 propane gas vehicle facilities are available to be issued to
 11 26 taxpayers for installations of all alternative fuel vehicle
