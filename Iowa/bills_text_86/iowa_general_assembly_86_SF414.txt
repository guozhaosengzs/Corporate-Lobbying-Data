  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5  2 withdrawal.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  5  3 account of the death of the account holder.

  5  6 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the

  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section

  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also

  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The

  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section

  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The

  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a

  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the

  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents

  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives

  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  4 30    c.  (1)  Add, to the extent previously subtracted under
  4 31 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 32 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 33 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  If the

  5 15 person other than the account holder.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.

  4 33 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  If the
  4 34 withdrawal is made on a day other than the last business day

  5  1 penalty in an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of the
  5  2 withdrawal.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  5  3 account of the death of the account holder.
  5  4    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  5  5 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  6 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  8 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  9 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5 10 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5 11    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5 12 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5 13    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5 14 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 15 person other than the account holder.
  5 16    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 17 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 18 bankruptcy.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 33 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  If the
  4 34 withdrawal is made on a day other than the last business day
  4 35 of the calendar year, such withdrawal shall also be assessed a
  5  1 penalty in an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of the
  5  2 withdrawal.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  5  3 account of the death of the account holder.
  5  4    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  5  5 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  6 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  8 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  9 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5 10 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5 11    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5 12 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):

  5 14 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 15 person other than the account holder.
  5 16    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 17 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 18 bankruptcy.
  5 19    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 20 "business day", "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer
  5 21 savings account" all mean the same as defined in section 12I.2.

  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents

  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in

  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account

  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account

  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the

  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,

  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year

  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 35 of the calendar year, such withdrawal shall also be assessed a
  5  1 penalty in an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of the
  5  2 withdrawal.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  5  3 account of the death of the account holder.
  5  4    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  5  5 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  6 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  8 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  9 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5 10 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5 11    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5 12 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5 13    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5 14 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 15 person other than the account holder.
  5 16    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 17 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 18 bankruptcy.
  5 19    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 20 "business day", "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer
  5 21 savings account" all mean the same as defined in section 12I.2.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5  2 withdrawal.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on

  5  5 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  6 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  7 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  8 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a

  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in

  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that

  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account

  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is

  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account

  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and

  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in

  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the

  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the

  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.

  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.

  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives

  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that

  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 24    Sec. 8.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held

  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8 10 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 30 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 31 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 32 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 33 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the

  5 34 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 35 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  6  1 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  6  2 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  6  3 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  6  4 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  6  5 joint account.
  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  8 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6 13 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6 14 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 15 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 16 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject
  6 17 to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the withdrawal, unless the
  6 18 withdrawal occurs on the last business day of the calendar year
  6 19 or was because of the death of the account holder.  The penalty
  6 20 amounts are required to be remitted by the account holder to
  6 21 the department of revenue in the same manner as Code section
  6 22 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of income tax.  A person
  6 23 ceases to be an account holder following the purchase of a
  6 24 principal residence after the establishment of an account.
  6 25    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 26 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 27 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account
  6 28 other than to the financial institution where the account is
  6 29 held for expenses or costs related to maintaining the account.
  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also
  6 33 requires the account holder to file reports as required by the
  6 34 department of revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof
  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  8  1 The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  8  2 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  8  3 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  8  4 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  8  5 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  8  6 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  8  7    The bill requires the director of revenue to adopt rules to
  8  8 implement and administer the bill.
  8  9    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  6  6    There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  7 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings

  6  9 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6 10 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6 11 the account is first established.
  6 12    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down

  6 30 Documentation regarding the segregation of funds in the account
  6 31 from other funds and documentation regarding eligible costs
  6 32 shall be maintained by the account holder.  The bill also

  6 35 of death of the account holder, the financial institution where
  7  1 the account is held shall distribute the funds to the estate
  7  2 of the account holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death
  7  3 beneficiary properly designated by the account holder. The
  7  4 bill provides that a financial institution shall not be held
  7  5 liable to an account holder, the director of revenue, or the
  7  6 treasurer of state for the payment of tax or any other claim
  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  9 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7 10 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  7  7 relating to distributions or withdrawals from an account.
  7  8    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives

  7 11 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7 12 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7 13 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.

  7 14 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7 15 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7 16 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7 17 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 18 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 19 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 20 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 21 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 22    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 23 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 24 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 25 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 26 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 27 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 28 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 29 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 30 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 31 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 32 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 33 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 34 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 35 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
