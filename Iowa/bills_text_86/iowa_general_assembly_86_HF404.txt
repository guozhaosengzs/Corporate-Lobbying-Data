  4  7 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  4  8 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  4  9 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  4 10 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  4 11 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  4 12 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  4 13 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  4 14 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising

  4 16 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  4 17 be trained, educated, and knowledgeable regarding the health
  4 18 care service provided and technology used and is prohibited
  4 19 from performing duties for which the professional does not have

  5  2 care provider and a patient as a prerequisite for payment
  5  3 for services appropriately provided through telehealth in

  4  7 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  4  8 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  4  9 professional who is using telehealth technology within the

  4 11 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  4 12 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  4 13 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to telehealth. The bill provides
  4  1 legislative findings regarding the use of telehealth services.
  4  2    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed

  4  7 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  4  8 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  4  9 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  4 10 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  4 11 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  4 12 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  4 13 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of

  4 15 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  4 16 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  4 17 be trained, educated, and knowledgeable regarding the health
  4 18 care service provided and technology used and is prohibited
  4 19 from performing duties for which the professional does not have
  4 20 sufficient training, education, and knowledge. Failure to have
  4 21 sufficient training, education, and knowledge is grounds for
  4 22 disciplinary action by the respective board.

  4 28 provision of telehealth services by such professionals and to
  4 29 amend any rules that conflict with the authorization of the use
  4 30 of telehealth as provided in the bill.
  4 31    The bill defines "telehealth" or "telehealth services" for
  4 32 the purpose of the professional licensure provisions.
  4 33    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  4 34 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  4 35 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  5  1 shall not require face=to=face contact between a health
  5  2 care provider and a patient as a prerequisite for payment
  5  3 for services appropriately provided through telehealth in
  5  4 accordance with generally accepted health care practices and
  5  5 standards prevailing in the applicable professional community
  5  6 at the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  5  7 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  5  8 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
  5  9 coverage.
  5 10    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 11 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 12 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 13 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 14 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or

  5 22 individual or group Medicare supplemental policy, unless
  5 23 coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal law;
  5 24 and a plan established pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public
  5 25 employees. The provision does not apply to accident=only,

  5 28 care, basic hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage
  5 29 as defined by the commissioner, disability income insurance
  5 30 coverage, coverage issued as a supplement to liability
  5 31 insurance, workers' compensation or similar insurance, or
  5 32 automobile medical payment insurance.
  5 33    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  5 34 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  5 35 provision.  The bill defines telehealth services for the
  6  1 purpose of the insurance provision.
  6  2    The bill directs the department of human services to
  6  3 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth services
  6  4 under the Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that

  6  7 for services appropriately provided through telehealth in
  6  8 accordance with generally accepted health care practices and

  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to telehealth. The bill provides
  4  1 legislative findings regarding the use of telehealth services.
  4  2    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed

  4  7 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  4  8 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  4  9 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  4 10 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  4 11 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  4 12 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  4 13 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  4 14 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising

  4 16 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  4 17 be trained, educated, and knowledgeable regarding the health
  4 18 care service provided and technology used and is prohibited
  4 19 from performing duties for which the professional does not have
  4 20 sufficient training, education, and knowledge. Failure to have
  4 21 sufficient training, education, and knowledge is grounds for
  4 22 disciplinary action by the respective board.

  4  7 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  4  8 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  4  9 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  4 10 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  4 11 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  4 12 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  4 13 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  4 14 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  4 15 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  4 16 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  4 17 be trained, educated, and knowledgeable regarding the health
  4 18 care service provided and technology used and is prohibited
  4 19 from performing duties for which the professional does not have

  5  2 care provider and a patient as a prerequisite for payment
  5  3 for services appropriately provided through telehealth in
  5  4 accordance with generally accepted health care practices and
  5  5 standards prevailing in the applicable professional community
