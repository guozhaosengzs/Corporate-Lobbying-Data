  7 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 16    This bill relates to interpreters for persons who are
  7 17 limited English proficient (LEP), including those persons who
  7 18 are deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing, in certain legal
  7 19 proceedings and court=ordered programs.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person is entitled to an interpreter
  7 21 if that person is LEP and is a participant in any legal
  7 22 proceeding, whom a court has ordered to participate in a
  7 23 predisposition program, or is a party in a pending court
  7 24 case and who requires an interpreter during a deposition or
  7 25 attorney consultation, if the party is entitled to appointment
  7 26 of legal counsel, or the court otherwise determines that the
  7 27 party is indigent. An LEP person is a person who is unable
  7 28 to adequately understand or effectively communicate in the
  7 29 English language because the person's primary language is a
  7 30 language other than English or the person is deaf, deaf=blind,
  7 31 or hard=of=hearing. "Deaf person" means an individual who uses
  7 32 sign language as the person's primary mode of communication
  7 33 and who may use interpreters to facilitate communication.
  7 34 "Hard=of=hearing person" means an individual who is unable
  7 35 to hear and distinguish sounds within normal conversational
  8  1 range and who needs to use speechreading, assistive listening
  8  2 devices, or other reasonable accommodations to facilitate
  8  3 communication.
  8  4    Under current law, in civil cases the court taxes the cost
  8  5 of an interpreter for a person who cannot speak or understand
  8  6 the English language as court costs, and in a proceeding
  8  7 before an administrative agency the agency may require that
  8  8 a party to the proceeding pay the expense of the interpreter
  8  9 for a person who cannot speak or understand the English
  8 10 language.  An interpreter appointed for a person who is deaf or
  8 11 hard=of=hearing is paid by the county if appointed by the court
  8 12 and by the administrative agency if appointed by such agency.
  8 13    The bill provides that fees for interpreter services shall
  8 14 not be charged to an LEP person when such person is entitled
  8 15 to an interpreter. Under the bill, interpreter fees are not
  8 16 taxed as court costs. The bill provides that if an LEP person
  8 17 is entitled to an oral language interpreter in a proceeding
  8 18 or program that is not before an agency, the state court
  8 19 administrator shall pay the oral language interpreter from the
  8 20 revolving fund created in Code section 602.1302(3), and if an
  8 21 LEP person is entitled to an oral language interpreter before
  8 22 an agency, the agency shall pay the interpreter. The bill
  8 23 further provides that if a deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing
  8 24 person is entitled to an interpreter or real=time court
  8 25 reporter in a proceeding not before an agency, the county
  8 26 where the interpreter services are provided shall pay the
  8 27 interpreter, and if a deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing
  8 28 person is entitled to an interpreter before an agency, the
  8 29 agency shall pay the interpreter.
  8 30    The bill makes conforming changes to exclude the costs
  8 31 of interpreter services from being charged to a parent in a
  8 32 juvenile proceeding (Code section 232.141) and to a person
  8 33 receiving indigent legal assistance (Code section 815.9).
  8 34    The bill also provides that the court or administrative
  8 35 agency, as appropriate, determines the fees and qualifications
  9  1 for interpreter services; that an interpreter in any legal
  9  2 proceeding is required to take an oath; and that a court or an
  9  3 administrative agency may inquire into the neutrality of an
  9  4 interpreter and may disqualify any person from serving as an
  9  5 interpreter. The bill requires electronic rather than audio
  9  6 recordings of the portion of proceedings where non=English
  9  7 testimony is given to be made and maintained for one year
  9  8 after the entry of the final disposition or sentence or, if
  9  9 the final judgment is appealed, until one year after the final
  9 10 disposition of the appeal.

  7 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 16    This bill relates to interpreters for persons who are
  7 17 limited English proficient (LEP), including those persons who
  7 18 are deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing, in certain legal
  7 19 proceedings and court=ordered programs.
  7 20    The bill provides that a person is entitled to an interpreter
  7 21 if that person is LEP and is a participant in any legal
  7 22 proceeding, whom a court has ordered to participate in a
  7 23 predisposition program, or is a party in a pending court
  7 24 case and who requires an interpreter during a deposition or
  7 25 attorney consultation, if the party is entitled to appointment
  7 26 of legal counsel, or the court otherwise determines that the
  7 27 party is indigent. An LEP person is a person who is unable
  7 28 to adequately understand or effectively communicate in the
  7 29 English language because the person's primary language is a
  7 30 language other than English or the person is deaf, deaf=blind,
  7 31 or hard=of=hearing. "Deaf person" means an individual who uses
  7 32 sign language as the person's primary mode of communication
  7 33 and who may use interpreters to facilitate communication.
  7 34 "Hard=of=hearing person" means an individual who is unable
  7 35 to hear and distinguish sounds within normal conversational
  8  1 range and who needs to use speechreading, assistive listening
  8  2 devices, or other reasonable accommodations to facilitate
  8  3 communication.
  8  4    Under current law, in civil cases the court taxes the cost
  8  5 of an interpreter for a person who cannot speak or understand
  8  6 the English language as court costs, and in a proceeding
  8  7 before an administrative agency the agency may require that
  8  8 a party to the proceeding pay the expense of the interpreter
  8  9 for a person who cannot speak or understand the English
  8 10 language.  An interpreter appointed for a person who is deaf or
  8 11 hard=of=hearing is paid by the county if appointed by the court
  8 12 and by the administrative agency if appointed by such agency.
  8 13    The bill provides that fees for interpreter services shall
  8 14 not be charged to an LEP person when such person is entitled
  8 15 to an interpreter. Under the bill, interpreter fees are not
  8 16 taxed as court costs. The bill provides that if an LEP person
  8 17 is entitled to an oral language interpreter in a proceeding
  8 18 or program that is not before an agency, the state court
  8 19 administrator shall pay the oral language interpreter from the
  8 20 revolving fund created in Code section 602.1302(3), and if an
  8 21 LEP person is entitled to an oral language interpreter before
  8 22 an agency, the agency shall pay the interpreter. The bill
  8 23 further provides that if a deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing
  8 24 person is entitled to an interpreter or real=time court
  8 25 reporter in a proceeding not before an agency, the county
  8 26 where the interpreter services are provided shall pay the
  8 27 interpreter, and if a deaf, deaf=blind, or hard=of=hearing
  8 28 person is entitled to an interpreter before an agency, the
  8 29 agency shall pay the interpreter.
  8 30    The bill makes conforming changes to exclude the costs
  8 31 of interpreter services from being charged to a parent in a
  8 32 juvenile proceeding (Code section 232.141) and to a person
  8 33 receiving indigent legal assistance (Code section 815.9).
  8 34    The bill also provides that the court or administrative
  8 35 agency, as appropriate, determines the fees and qualifications
  9  1 for interpreter services; that an interpreter in any legal
  9  2 proceeding is required to take an oath; and that a court or an
  9  3 administrative agency may inquire into the neutrality of an
  9  4 interpreter and may disqualify any person from serving as an
  9  5 interpreter. The bill requires electronic rather than audio
  9  6 recordings of the portion of proceedings where non=English
  9  7 testimony is given to be made and maintained for one year
  9  8 after the entry of the final disposition or sentence or, if
  9  9 the final judgment is appealed, until one year after the final
  9 10 disposition of the appeal.
