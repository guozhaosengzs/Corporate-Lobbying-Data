  7 11 are involved in distributing food to low=income families and
  7 12 individuals and unemployed families and individuals in this
  7 13 state.  The bill provides for the donation of food by sponsors
  7 14 of legislative events conducted on the premises of the state
  7 15 capitol; the establishment of three distribution programs, two
  7 16 within the department of agriculture and land stewardship, with
  7 17 accompanying appropriations, and one within the Iowa department
