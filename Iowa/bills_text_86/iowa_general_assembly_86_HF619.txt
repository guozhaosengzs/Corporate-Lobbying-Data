  3 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 32    This bill relates to the use of eminent domain authority and
  3 33 modifying and establishing related procedures.
  3 34    Division I of the bill amends provisions of Code section
  3 35 6A.22, relating to the use of condemnation for creation of
  4  1 a lake for drinking water needs.  The bill provides that
  4  2 for purposes of determining the number of acres justified
  4  3 as necessary for a surface drinking water source, the
  4  4 determination of surface drinking water capacity needs shall
  4  5 be limited to the needs of the population of the county where
  4  6 the lake is to be developed or created, according to the most

  4 18 eminent domain for development or creation of a lake and limits
  4 19 that authority based on the need for surface drinking water.
  4 20 Division II of the bill prohibits an acquiring agency from
  4 21 condemning private property for creation of a lake as a surface
  4 22 drinking water source if an existing drinking water source may
  4 23 be expanded or supplemented for such purpose.
  4 24    Division II of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
  4 25 applies to projects or condemnation proceedings pending or
  4 26 commenced on or after the effective date of the division.
  4 27    Division III of the bill provides that when two years have
  4 28 elapsed since property was condemned for the creation of a lake
  4 29 and the property has not been used for the purpose stated in
  4 30 the application, and the acquiring agency has not taken action
  4 31 to dispose of the property pursuant to Code section 6B.56, the
  4 32 acquiring agency shall, within 60 days, adopt a resolution
  4 33 offering the property for sale to the prior owner at a price
  4 34 as provided in Code section 6B.56. If the acquiring agency
  4 35 has not adopted a resolution within the 60=day time period,
  5  1 the prior owner may petition the acquiring agency to offer the
  5  2 property for sale to the prior owner at a price as provided in
  5  3 Code section 6B.56. The bill requires the acquiring agency to
  5  4 give written notice to the owner at the time damages are paid
  5  5 to the owner of the right to purchase the property under such
  5  6 circumstances.
  5  7    Division III also specifies that current Code section
  5  8 6B.56A, relating to the disposition of condemned property, does
  5  9 not apply to property condemned under Code section 6A.22 for
  5 10 the creation of a lake.
  5 11    Division III of the bill takes effect upon enactment and
  5 12 applies to projects or condemnation proceedings pending or
  5 13 commenced on or after the effective date of division III of the
  5 14 bill.
