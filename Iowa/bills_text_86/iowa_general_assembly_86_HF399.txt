  4 12 persons.
  4 13    The purpose of the establishment of the medical and personal

  4 35 admit that resident or tenant unless an alternative, adequate
  5  1 placement for the person is arranged.
  5  2    The bill requires DHS to assess a resident or tenant's
  5  3 payment options if accepted into a state=operated facility.
  5  4 Medicaid is declared to be the payor of last resort.
  5  5    The bill also mandates that a state=operated medical
  5  6 and personal care facility for sex offenders providing
  5  7 nursing facility care must meet requirements for Medicare

  5 10 chapter 135C or 231C.
  5 11    The bill provides certain requirements that DHS must
  5 12 establish by rule concerning the operations of a medical and

  4 23 to a private nursing facility, residential care facility, or
  4 24 assisted living program due to the person's status as a sex
  4 25 offender.  If a person admitted to a state=operated medical and
  4 26 personal care facility for sex offenders no longer meets one of
  4 27 these eligibility requirements, the patient may be discharged.
  4 28 A person may also be discharged from a state=operated facility
  4 29 if an alternative, adequate placement is arranged.

  4 35 admit that resident or tenant unless an alternative, adequate
  5  1 placement for the person is arranged.
  5  2    The bill requires DHS to assess a resident or tenant's
  5  3 payment options if accepted into a state=operated facility.

  5  5    The bill also mandates that a state=operated medical
  5  6 and personal care facility for sex offenders providing
  5  7 nursing facility care must meet requirements for Medicare
  5  8 certification, but a state=operated medical and personal care
  5  9 facility is not required to be licensed or certified under Code
  5 10 chapter 135C or 231C.
  5 11    The bill provides certain requirements that DHS must
  5 12 establish by rule concerning the operations of a medical and
