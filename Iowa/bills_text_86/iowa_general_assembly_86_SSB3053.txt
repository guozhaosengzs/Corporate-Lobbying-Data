EXPLANATION
26


The

constitute
agreement
with
27


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of

general
assembly.
28


This
bill
relates
to
the
statute
of
repose
for
medical
29


malpractice
claims.
30


Under
current
law,
medical
malpractice
claims
are
subject
31


to
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
and
six-year
statute
of
32


repose.
A
statute
of
limitations
bars
the
right
to
bring
an
33


accrued
action
after
a
specified
time,
whereas
a
statute
of
34


repose
terminates
any
right
of
action
after
a
specified
time,

3


after
the
date
on
which
the
claimant
knew,
should
have
known
4


through
the
use
of
reasonable
diligence,
or
received
notice
5


in
writing
of
the
existence
of,
the
injury
or
death
for
which
6


damages
are
sought
in
the
action,
whichever
of
the
dates
occurs
7


first.
Current
Code
section
614.1(9)(a)
bars
actions
brought
8


more

cases
where
a
foreign

or
12


death.
13


The
bill
provides
a
second
exception
to
the
six-year
statute
14


of
repose.
Under
the
bill,
if
the
cause
of
the

and
surgeon,

properly
interpreted
19


the
patient’s
test
results
and
communicated
those
results
to
20


the
patient
in
a
timely
manner,
the
six-year
statute
of
repose
21


does
not
apply.
