  2 10 area used to maintain animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep,
  2 11 chickens, turkeys, or fish) for at least 45 days.  Animal unit
  2 12 capacity is determined by multiplying the maximum number of
  2 13 animals under each category of animal based on weight that may
  2 14 be confined at one time by a per animal equivalency factor then
  2 15 adding those sums together. A small animal feeding operation
  2 16 has an animal unit capacity of 500 or fewer animal units.

  2  1 property used to control or abate air or water pollution or
  2  2 alternatively to enhance air or water quality.  The bill

  2  4 such property used for maintaining animals that are part of a
  2  5 confinement feeding operation, unless the property is used in
  2  6 a small animal feeding operation (Code section 459.102).  The
  2  7 bill applies to assessment years beginning on or after January

  2 10 area used to maintain animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep,
  2 11 chickens, turkeys, or fish) for at least 45 days.  Animal unit
  2 12 capacity is determined by multiplying the maximum number of
  2 13 animals under each category of animal based on weight that may
  2 14 be confined at one time by a per animal equivalency factor then
  2 15 adding those sums together. A small animal feeding operation
