  5 33 enrolled in an alternative options education program adopted
  5 34 by the school district where the pupil resides under section
  5 35 280.19A.  If the pupil meets the academic growth standards

  6 19 family scholarship fund. A nonpublic school that accepts
  6 20 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
  6 21 account in the military family scholarship fund is not an agent
  6 22 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.

  6 22 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.

  5  9 section or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a
  5 10 payment from an account in the military family scholarship fund
  5 11 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent

  5 27    8.  a.  If a pupil fails to meet the academic growth
  5 28 standards established by the state board of education under

  5 14 from the scholarship have been disbursed from the applicable
  5 15 account in the military family scholarship fund, the department

  5 27    8.  a.  If a pupil fails to meet the academic growth
  5 28 standards established by the state board of education under

  6 22 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.

  5 11 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent
  5 12 practice.  The false claim for a military family scholarship or
  5 13 a payment from an account shall be disallowed and if amounts
  5 14 from the scholarship have been disbursed from the applicable
  5 15 account in the military family scholarship fund, the department
  5 16 of management shall initiate legal proceedings to recover such
  5 17 amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for purposes of

  6 22 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.

  5 26 of the state.
  5 27    8.  a.  If a pupil fails to meet the academic growth
  5 28 standards established by the state board of education under
  5 29 paragraph "b" for two consecutive school years for which
  5 30 the student has received a military family scholarship under
  5 31 this section, the pupil shall not be eligible for a military

  5 33 enrolled in an alternative options education program adopted
  5 34 by the school district where the pupil resides under section
  5 35 280.19A.  If the pupil meets the academic growth standards
  6  1 established by the state board of education for two consecutive

  5 16 of management shall initiate legal proceedings to recover such

  6 34                           EXPLANATION
  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill provides military family scholarships for pupils
  7  3 attending a nonpublic school and establishes a military family
  7  4 scholarship fund.
  7  5    Under the bill, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  6 a military family scholarship: (1) a dependent child of a
  7  7 qualified military person or qualified veteran, as defined in
  7  8 the bill, eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12
  7  9 who resides in this state and who is attending a nonpublic
  7 10 school during the budget year for which the scholarship is
  7 11 requested; (2) a surviving child who is receiving dependency
  7 12 and indemnity compensation and who resides in this state and is
  7 13 attending a nonpublic school during the budget year for which
  7 14 the scholarship is requested. By January 31 preceding the
  7 15 school year for which the scholarship is requested, the parent
  7 16 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive a scholarship
  7 17 must submit an application to the department of education
  7 18 indicating that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the
  7 19 pupil in a nonpublic school.
  7 20    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 21 year for which the military family scholarship is requested,
  7 22 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 23 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 24 designated for the following school year to receive a military
  7 25 family scholarship and the amount of the military family
  7 26 scholarship for each pupil.  Military family scholarships may
  7 27 only be approved for one school year per application, and
  7 28 applications must be submitted for military family scholarships
  7 29 in subsequent school years.
  7 30    The amount of each military family scholarship is equal to
  7 31 the lesser of the regular program state cost per pupil and the
  7 32 annual tuition at the nonpublic school that the pupil will be
  7 33 attending in the same school year for which the scholarship is
  7 34 requested.
  7 35    The bill creates a military family scholarship fund in
  8  1 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  8  2 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  8  3 for the purpose of providing military family scholarships.  For
  8  4 the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each succeeding
  8  5 fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general fund of the
  8  6 state to the department of management for deposit in the fund
  8  7 the amount necessary to pay all military family scholarships
  8  8 approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for
  8  9 a military family scholarship, the department of management
  8 10 must establish an account for that pupil in the military family
  8 11 scholarship fund.  The amount of the pupil's military family
  8 12 scholarship is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  8 13 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  8 14 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  8 15 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  8 16 during that fiscal year.
  8 17    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 18 schools accredited by the Iowa department of education
  8 19 and nonpublic institutions that comply with state board of
  8 20 education standards for providing special education programs.
  8 21    The bill authorizes the department of education to contract
  8 22 with a private financial management firm to manage the military
  8 23 family scholarship fund, in collaboration with the treasurer
  8 24 of state, including providing for the disbursement of military
  8 25 family scholarships in the form of an electronic debit card
  8 26 or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's account
  8 27 within the fund.
  8 28    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 29 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 30 pupil's account within the military family scholarship fund for
  8 31 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 32 years.
  8 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in the
  8 34 pupil's account in the military family scholarship fund upon
  8 35 graduation from high school or upon termination of the pupil's
  9  1 enrollment in the nonpublic school, moneys in the pupil's
  9  2 account are transferred by the department of management for
  9  3 deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9  4    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim
  9  5 for the purpose of obtaining a military family scholarship
  9  6 or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a payment
  9  7 from an account within the military family scholarship fund
  9  8 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent
  9  9 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
  9 10 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
  9 11 recover scholarships and amounts improperly awarded or paid
  9 12 from accounts under the bill.
  9 13    The bill authorizes the state board of education to adopt
  9 14 standards for determining satisfactory academic performance
  9 15 and growth of pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  9 16 receiving military family scholarships.  If a pupil fails to
  9 17 meet the academic growth standards established by the state
  9 18 board of education for two consecutive school years for which
  9 19 the student has received a military family scholarship, the
  9 20 pupil shall not be eligible for a military family scholarship
  9 21 for future school years until the pupil has demonstrated
  9 22 satisfactory academic performance in an alternative options
  9 23 education program.
  9 24    The bill provides that, except as necessary to implement
  9 25 the military family scholarship program, the bill is not to be
  9 26 construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision
  9 27 of the state to exercise authority over any nonpublic school
  9 28 or be construed to require a nonpublic school to modify its
  9 29 admissions educational program in order to receive payment
  9 30 from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's account
  9 31 in the military family scholarship fund. In addition,
  9 32 a nonpublic school that accepts payment from a parent or
  9 33 guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the military
  9 34 family scholarship fund is not an agent of this state or of a
  9 35 political subdivision of this state.
 10  1 The bill provides that moneys from a military family
 10  2 scholarship under the bill are not taxable income under Code
 10  3 chapter 422.
 10  4    The bill applies to school budget years and fiscal years
 10  5 beginning on or after July 1, 2017.
 10  6    The provision of the bill amending Code section 422.7
 10  7 applies to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

  7 16 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive a scholarship
  7 17 must submit an application to the department of education
  7 18 indicating that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the
  7 19 pupil in a nonpublic school.
  7 20    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 21 year for which the military family scholarship is requested,
  7 22 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 23 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 24 designated for the following school year to receive a military
  7 25 family scholarship and the amount of the military family
  7 26 scholarship for each pupil.  Military family scholarships may
  7 27 only be approved for one school year per application, and
  7 28 applications must be submitted for military family scholarships
  7 29 in subsequent school years.
  7 30    The amount of each military family scholarship is equal to
  7 31 the lesser of the regular program state cost per pupil and the
  7 32 annual tuition at the nonpublic school that the pupil will be
  7 33 attending in the same school year for which the scholarship is
  7 34 requested.
  7 35    The bill creates a military family scholarship fund in
  8  1 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  8  2 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  8  3 for the purpose of providing military family scholarships.  For
  8  4 the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each succeeding
  8  5 fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general fund of the
  8  6 state to the department of management for deposit in the fund
  8  7 the amount necessary to pay all military family scholarships
  8  8 approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for
  8  9 a military family scholarship, the department of management
  8 10 must establish an account for that pupil in the military family
  8 11 scholarship fund.  The amount of the pupil's military family
  8 12 scholarship is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  8 13 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  8 14 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  8 15 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  8 16 during that fiscal year.
  8 17    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 18 schools accredited by the Iowa department of education
  8 19 and nonpublic institutions that comply with state board of
  8 20 education standards for providing special education programs.
  8 21    The bill authorizes the department of education to contract
  8 22 with a private financial management firm to manage the military
  8 23 family scholarship fund, in collaboration with the treasurer
  8 24 of state, including providing for the disbursement of military
  8 25 family scholarships in the form of an electronic debit card
  8 26 or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's account
  8 27 within the fund.
  8 28    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 29 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 30 pupil's account within the military family scholarship fund for
  8 31 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 32 years.
  8 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in the
  8 34 pupil's account in the military family scholarship fund upon
  8 35 graduation from high school or upon termination of the pupil's
  9  1 enrollment in the nonpublic school, moneys in the pupil's
  9  2 account are transferred by the department of management for
  9  3 deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9  4    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim
  9  5 for the purpose of obtaining a military family scholarship
  9  6 or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a payment
  9  7 from an account within the military family scholarship fund
  9  8 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent
  9  9 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
  9 10 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
  9 11 recover scholarships and amounts improperly awarded or paid
  9 12 from accounts under the bill.
  9 13    The bill authorizes the state board of education to adopt
  9 14 standards for determining satisfactory academic performance
  9 15 and growth of pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  9 16 receiving military family scholarships.  If a pupil fails to
  9 17 meet the academic growth standards established by the state
  9 18 board of education for two consecutive school years for which
  9 19 the student has received a military family scholarship, the
  9 20 pupil shall not be eligible for a military family scholarship
  9 21 for future school years until the pupil has demonstrated
  9 22 satisfactory academic performance in an alternative options
  9 23 education program.
  9 24    The bill provides that, except as necessary to implement
  9 25 the military family scholarship program, the bill is not to be
  9 26 construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision
  9 27 of the state to exercise authority over any nonpublic school
  9 28 or be construed to require a nonpublic school to modify its
  9 29 admissions educational program in order to receive payment
  9 30 from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's account
  9 31 in the military family scholarship fund. In addition,
  9 32 a nonpublic school that accepts payment from a parent or
  9 33 guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the military
  9 34 family scholarship fund is not an agent of this state or of a
  9 35 political subdivision of this state.

 10  2 scholarship under the bill are not taxable income under Code
 10  3 chapter 422.

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill provides military family scholarships for pupils
  7  3 attending a nonpublic school and establishes a military family
  7  4 scholarship fund.
  7  5    Under the bill, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  6 a military family scholarship: (1) a dependent child of a
  7  7 qualified military person or qualified veteran, as defined in
  7  8 the bill, eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12
  7  9 who resides in this state and who is attending a nonpublic

  7 12 and indemnity compensation and who resides in this state and is
  7 13 attending a nonpublic school during the budget year for which
  7 14 the scholarship is requested. By January 31 preceding the
  7 15 school year for which the scholarship is requested, the parent
  7 16 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive a scholarship
  7 17 must submit an application to the department of education
  7 18 indicating that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the
  7 19 pupil in a nonpublic school.
  7 20    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 21 year for which the military family scholarship is requested,
  7 22 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 23 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 24 designated for the following school year to receive a military
  7 25 family scholarship and the amount of the military family
  7 26 scholarship for each pupil.  Military family scholarships may
  7 27 only be approved for one school year per application, and
  7 28 applications must be submitted for military family scholarships
  7 29 in subsequent school years.
  7 30    The amount of each military family scholarship is equal to
  7 31 the lesser of the regular program state cost per pupil and the
  7 32 annual tuition at the nonpublic school that the pupil will be
  7 33 attending in the same school year for which the scholarship is
  7 34 requested.
  7 35    The bill creates a military family scholarship fund in
  8  1 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  8  2 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  8  3 for the purpose of providing military family scholarships.  For

  8  5 fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general fund of the
  8  6 state to the department of management for deposit in the fund
  8  7 the amount necessary to pay all military family scholarships
  8  8 approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for
  8  9 a military family scholarship, the department of management
  8 10 must establish an account for that pupil in the military family
  8 11 scholarship fund.  The amount of the pupil's military family
  8 12 scholarship is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  8 13 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  8 14 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  8 15 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  8 16 during that fiscal year.
  8 17    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 18 schools accredited by the Iowa department of education
  8 19 and nonpublic institutions that comply with state board of
  8 20 education standards for providing special education programs.
  8 21    The bill authorizes the department of education to contract
  8 22 with a private financial management firm to manage the military
  8 23 family scholarship fund, in collaboration with the treasurer
  8 24 of state, including providing for the disbursement of military
  8 25 family scholarships in the form of an electronic debit card
  8 26 or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's account
  8 27 within the fund.
  8 28    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 29 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 30 pupil's account within the military family scholarship fund for
  8 31 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 32 years.
  8 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in the
  8 34 pupil's account in the military family scholarship fund upon
  8 35 graduation from high school or upon termination of the pupil's
  9  1 enrollment in the nonpublic school, moneys in the pupil's
  9  2 account are transferred by the department of management for
  9  3 deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9  4    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim
  9  5 for the purpose of obtaining a military family scholarship
  9  6 or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a payment
  9  7 from an account within the military family scholarship fund
  9  8 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent
  9  9 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
  9 10 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
  9 11 recover scholarships and amounts improperly awarded or paid
  9 12 from accounts under the bill.
  9 13    The bill authorizes the state board of education to adopt
  9 14 standards for determining satisfactory academic performance
  9 15 and growth of pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  9 16 receiving military family scholarships.  If a pupil fails to
  9 17 meet the academic growth standards established by the state

  6 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  2    This bill provides military family scholarships for pupils
  7  3 attending a nonpublic school and establishes a military family
  7  4 scholarship fund.
  7  5    Under the bill, the following pupils are eligible to receive
  7  6 a military family scholarship: (1) a dependent child of a
  7  7 qualified military person or qualified veteran, as defined in
  7  8 the bill, eligible to enroll in kindergarten through grade 12
  7  9 who resides in this state and who is attending a nonpublic
  7 10 school during the budget year for which the scholarship is
  7 11 requested; (2) a surviving child who is receiving dependency
  7 12 and indemnity compensation and who resides in this state and is
  7 13 attending a nonpublic school during the budget year for which
  7 14 the scholarship is requested. By January 31 preceding the
  7 15 school year for which the scholarship is requested, the parent
  7 16 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive a scholarship
  7 17 must submit an application to the department of education
  7 18 indicating that the parent or guardian intends to enroll the
  7 19 pupil in a nonpublic school.
  7 20    The bill requires that by March 1 preceding the school
  7 21 year for which the military family scholarship is requested,
  7 22 the department of education must notify the department of
  7 23 management of the number of pupils in each school district
  7 24 designated for the following school year to receive a military
  7 25 family scholarship and the amount of the military family
  7 26 scholarship for each pupil.  Military family scholarships may
  7 27 only be approved for one school year per application, and
  7 28 applications must be submitted for military family scholarships
  7 29 in subsequent school years.
  7 30    The amount of each military family scholarship is equal to
  7 31 the lesser of the regular program state cost per pupil and the
  7 32 annual tuition at the nonpublic school that the pupil will be
  7 33 attending in the same school year for which the scholarship is
  7 34 requested.
  7 35    The bill creates a military family scholarship fund in
  8  1 the state treasury under the control of the department of
  8  2 management consisting of moneys appropriated to the department
  8  3 for the purpose of providing military family scholarships.  For
  8  4 the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2017, and each succeeding
  8  5 fiscal year, there is appropriated from the general fund of the
  8  6 state to the department of management for deposit in the fund
  8  7 the amount necessary to pay all military family scholarships
  8  8 approved for that fiscal year.  For each pupil approved for
  8  9 a military family scholarship, the department of management
  8 10 must establish an account for that pupil in the military family
  8 11 scholarship fund.  The amount of the pupil's military family
  8 12 scholarship is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  8 13 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians
  8 14 for the payment of qualified educational expenses, as defined
  8 15 in the bill, incurred by the parent or guardian for the pupil
  8 16 during that fiscal year.
  8 17    The bill defines "nonpublic school" to mean those nonpublic
  8 18 schools accredited by the Iowa department of education
  8 19 and nonpublic institutions that comply with state board of
  8 20 education standards for providing special education programs.
  8 21    The bill authorizes the department of education to contract
  8 22 with a private financial management firm to manage the military
  8 23 family scholarship fund, in collaboration with the treasurer
  8 24 of state, including providing for the disbursement of military
  8 25 family scholarships in the form of an electronic debit card
  8 26 or checks that are payable directly from the pupil's account
  8 27 within the fund.
  8 28    The bill provides that moneys remaining in a pupil's account
  8 29 upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall remain in the
  8 30 pupil's account within the military family scholarship fund for
  8 31 the payment of qualified educational expenses in future fiscal
  8 32 years.
  8 33    Under the bill, for each pupil with a positive balance in the
  8 34 pupil's account in the military family scholarship fund upon
  8 35 graduation from high school or upon termination of the pupil's
  9  1 enrollment in the nonpublic school, moneys in the pupil's
  9  2 account are transferred by the department of management for
  9  3 deposit in the general fund of the state.
  9  4    The bill provides that a person who makes a false claim
  9  5 for the purpose of obtaining a military family scholarship
  9  6 or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a payment
  9  7 from an account within the military family scholarship fund
  9  8 without being legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent
  9  9 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
  9 10 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
  9 11 recover scholarships and amounts improperly awarded or paid
  9 12 from accounts under the bill.
  9 13    The bill authorizes the state board of education to adopt
  9 14 standards for determining satisfactory academic performance
  9 15 and growth of pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 who are
  9 16 receiving military family scholarships.  If a pupil fails to
  9 17 meet the academic growth standards established by the state
  9 18 board of education for two consecutive school years for which
  9 19 the student has received a military family scholarship, the
  9 20 pupil shall not be eligible for a military family scholarship
  9 21 for future school years until the pupil has demonstrated
  9 22 satisfactory academic performance in an alternative options
  9 23 education program.
  9 24    The bill provides that, except as necessary to implement
  9 25 the military family scholarship program, the bill is not to be
  9 26 construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision
  9 27 of the state to exercise authority over any nonpublic school

  8  9 a military family scholarship, the department of management
  8 10 must establish an account for that pupil in the military family
  8 11 scholarship fund.  The amount of the pupil's military family
  8 12 scholarship is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1
  8 13 and such amount is available for use by parents and guardians

  9  1 enrollment in the nonpublic school, moneys in the pupil's
  9  2 account are transferred by the department of management for

  9  5 for the purpose of obtaining a military family scholarship
  9  6 or who knowingly receives the scholarship or makes a payment

  9 18 board of education for two consecutive school years for which
  9 19 the student has received a military family scholarship, the
  9 20 pupil shall not be eligible for a military family scholarship
  9 21 for future school years until the pupil has demonstrated
  9 22 satisfactory academic performance in an alternative options
  9 23 education program.
  9 24    The bill provides that, except as necessary to implement
  9 25 the military family scholarship program, the bill is not to be
  9 26 construed to authorize the state or any political subdivision
  9 27 of the state to exercise authority over any nonpublic school
  9 28 or be construed to require a nonpublic school to modify its
  9 29 admissions educational program in order to receive payment
  9 30 from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's account
