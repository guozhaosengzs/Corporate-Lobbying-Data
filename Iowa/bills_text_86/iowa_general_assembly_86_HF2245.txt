  1  5 application from a county for a countywide chemical substance
  1  6 abuse monitoring pilot program that is available twenty=four
  1  7 hours per day, seven days per week, in an effort to reduce the
  1  8 number of crimes that have a nexus with chemical substance
  1  9 abuse.
  1 10    2.  A chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot program
  1 11 shall do all of the following:
  1 12    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
  1 13 to, or been convicted of a crime that has a nexus with chemical
  1 14 substance abuse to abstain from all chemical substances for
  1 15 a period of time. However, this paragraph does not apply to
  1 16 a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to, or been
  1 17 convicted of a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  1 18 in violation of section 321J.2 or 321J.2A where the person's
  1 19 alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and no accident
  1 20 resulting in personal injury or property damage occurred.
  1 21    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
  1 22 whether a chemical substance is present in the person's body
  1 23 in the following manner:
  1 24    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
  1 25 immediate sanction can be applied.
  1 26    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) is impractical, by
  1 27 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring.
  1 28    c.  Apply sanctions when test results definitively, and
  1 29 without presumption, indicate the presence of chemical
  1 30 substances.
  1 31    d.  Require a person participating in the program to pay
  1 32 program costs, including costs of installation, monitoring, and
  1 33 deactivation of any testing devices.
  1 34    3.  A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  1 35 pursuant to this section may order a defendant, as a condition
  2  1 of pretrial release, probation, or bond, to participate in the
  2  2 program.
  2  3    4.  An approved pilot program shall begin on October 1, 2016,

  2 21                           EXPLANATION
  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 25 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department of
  2 26 public safety, in collaboration with the governor's traffic
  2 27 safety bureau, to approve applications from counties for
  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have

  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program

  2 21                           EXPLANATION
  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 25 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department of
  2 26 public safety, in collaboration with the governor's traffic
  2 27 safety bureau, to approve applications from counties for
  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 31 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 32 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3 14 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3 15 probation, or bond, to participate in the program.
  3 16    Approved pilot programs shall begin October 1, 2016, or
  3 17 upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  3 18 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3 19 department of public safety is to adopt rules to implement the
  3 20 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3 21 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3 22 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 23 counties. The department is also directed to pursue federal
  3 24 funding opportunities for the programs. Implementation of the
  3 25 programs shall be contingent on the availability of funding.
  3 26 The department is directed to submit a report on the results
  3 27 of the pilot programs and make recommendations to the general
  3 28 assembly by December 15, 2017.

  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 25 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department of
  2 26 public safety, in collaboration with the governor's traffic
  2 27 safety bureau, to approve applications from counties for
  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 31 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 32 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3 14 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3 15 probation, or bond, to participate in the program.
  3 16    Approved pilot programs shall begin October 1, 2016, or
  3 17 upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  3 18 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3 19 department of public safety is to adopt rules to implement the
  3 20 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3 21 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3 22 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 23 counties. The department is also directed to pursue federal
  3 24 funding opportunities for the programs. Implementation of the
  3 25 programs shall be contingent on the availability of funding.
  3 26 The department is directed to submit a report on the results
  3 27 of the pilot programs and make recommendations to the general
  3 28 assembly by December 15, 2017.

  2 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 24    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 25 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department of
  2 26 public safety, in collaboration with the governor's traffic
  2 27 safety bureau, to approve applications from counties for
  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 31 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 32 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3 14 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3 15 probation, or bond, to participate in the program.
  3 16    Approved pilot programs shall begin October 1, 2016, or
  3 17 upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  3 18 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3 19 department of public safety is to adopt rules to implement the
  3 20 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3 21 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3 22 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 23 counties. The department is also directed to pursue federal
  3 24 funding opportunities for the programs. Implementation of the
  3 25 programs shall be contingent on the availability of funding.
  3 26 The department is directed to submit a report on the results
  3 27 of the pilot programs and make recommendations to the general
  3 28 assembly by December 15, 2017.

  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 31 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 32 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3 14 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3 15 probation, or bond, to participate in the program.
  3 16    Approved pilot programs shall begin October 1, 2016, or
  3 17 upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  3 18 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The

  3 20 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3 21 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3 22 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 23 counties. The department is also directed to pursue federal
  3 24 funding opportunities for the programs. Implementation of the
  3 25 programs shall be contingent on the availability of funding.
  3 26 The department is directed to submit a report on the results
  3 27 of the pilot programs and make recommendations to the general
  3 28 assembly by December 15, 2017.

  2 27 safety bureau, to approve applications from counties for
  2 28 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 29 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 30 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 31 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 32 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 33 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 34    The programs shall require persons charged with or convicted
  2 35 of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to abstain
  3  1 from all chemical substances for a period of time. However,
  3  2 persons with a first offense of operating while intoxicated
  3  3 where the person's alcohol concentration was lower than .15 and
  3  4 no accident resulting in personal injury or property damage
  3  5 occurred are excluded. The programs shall also require testing
  3  6 to determine whether a chemical substance is present at least
  3  7 twice per day at a central location where an immediate sanction
  3  8 can be applied or, where such testing is impractical, by
  3  9 continuous transdermal or electronic monitoring. The programs
  3 10 shall apply sanctions when test results definitively indicate
  3 11 the presence of a chemical substance. The programs shall
  3 12 require participants to pay program costs.
  3 13    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3 14 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3 15 probation, or bond, to participate in the program.
  3 16    Approved pilot programs shall begin October 1, 2016, or
  3 17 upon the effective date of department rules, whichever is
  3 18 earlier, and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The

  3 20 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3 21 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3 22 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 23 counties. The department is also directed to pursue federal
  3 24 funding opportunities for the programs. Implementation of the
