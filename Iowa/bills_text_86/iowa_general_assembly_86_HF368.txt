  4  6 to exceed three thousand dollars per individual per tax year,
  4  7 or six thousand dollars per tax year for a married couple who
  4  8 have a joint first=time homebuyer savings account and file a
  4  9 joint return.  An amount of contributions made during a tax
  4 10 year in excess of three thousand dollars, or six thousand
  4 11 dollars, as applicable, may be subtracted by an  account holder
  4 12 in a subsequent tax year, provided the total exemption under

  5 17    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
  5 18 2016.
  5 19    Sec. 8.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years
  5 20 beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4  9 joint return.  An amount of contributions made during a tax
  4 10 year in excess of three thousand dollars, or six thousand

  4 12 in a subsequent tax year, provided the total exemption under

  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal

  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time

  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4  7 or six thousand dollars per tax year for a married couple who
  4  8 have a joint first=time homebuyer savings account and file a
  4  9 joint return.  An amount of contributions made during a tax
  4 10 year in excess of three thousand dollars, or six thousand
  4 11 dollars, as applicable, may be subtracted by an  account holder
  4 12 in a subsequent tax year, provided the total exemption under
  4 13 this paragraph for the subsequent tax year does not exceed
  4 14 three thousand dollars, or six thousand dollars, as applicable.
  4 15 This paragraph shall not apply to an account holder more
  4 16 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 17 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 18    b.  Subtract, to the extent included, income from interest
  4 19 and earnings received from an account holder's first=time
  4 20 homebuyer savings account.  This paragraph "b" shall not apply
  4 21 to any interest and earnings received by an account holder more
  4 22 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 23 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 24    c.  (1)  Add, to the extent previously subtracted under
  4 25 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  3 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in

  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 10 year in excess of three thousand dollars, or six thousand
  4 11 dollars, as applicable, may be subtracted by an  account holder
  4 12 in a subsequent tax year, provided the total exemption under
  4 13 this paragraph for the subsequent tax year does not exceed
  4 14 three thousand dollars, or six thousand dollars, as applicable.
  4 15 This paragraph shall not apply to an account holder more
  4 16 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 17 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 18    b.  Subtract, to the extent included, income from interest
  4 19 and earnings received from an account holder's first=time
  4 20 homebuyer savings account.  This paragraph "b" shall not apply
  4 21 to any interest and earnings received by an account holder more
  4 22 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 23 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 24    c.  (1)  Add, to the extent previously subtracted under
  4 25 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  3 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 13 bankruptcy.
  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 13 this paragraph for the subsequent tax year does not exceed
  4 14 three thousand dollars, or six thousand dollars, as applicable.
  4 15 This paragraph shall not apply to an account holder more
  4 16 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 17 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 18    b.  Subtract, to the extent included, income from interest
  4 19 and earnings received from an account holder's first=time
  4 20 homebuyer savings account.  This paragraph "b" shall not apply
  4 21 to any interest and earnings received by an account holder more
  4 22 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 23 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 24    c.  (1)  Add, to the extent previously subtracted under
  4 25 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  3 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 13 bankruptcy.
  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",

  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 15 "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer savings account" all
  5 16 mean the same as defined in section 12I.2.
  5 17    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
  5 18 2016.
  5 19    Sec. 8.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 18    b.  Subtract, to the extent included, income from interest
  4 19 and earnings received from an account holder's first=time
  4 20 homebuyer savings account.  This paragraph "b" shall not apply
  4 21 to any interest and earnings received by an account holder more
  4 22 than ten years after the account holder first establishes a
  4 23 first=time homebuyer savings account.
  4 24    c.  (1)  Add, to the extent previously subtracted under
  4 25 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  3 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 13 bankruptcy.
  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 15 "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer savings account" all

  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a

  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately

  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless

  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.

  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 25 paragraph "a", the amount resulting from a withdrawal made from
  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on

  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.

  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives

  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer

  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing

  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately

  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 26 a first=time homebuyer savings account for purposes other than
  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the
  5  3 calendar year in which the account holder first establishes a
  5  4 first=time homebuyer savings account, whichever occurs first,
  5  5 shall be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1).
  5  6    (3)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", the following shall
  5  7 not be considered a withdrawal under subparagraph (1):
  5  8    (a)  Any amount transferred between different first=time
  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 13 bankruptcy.
  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 15 "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer savings account" all
  5 16 mean the same as defined in section 12I.2.
  5 17    Sec. 7.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
  5 18 2016.
  5 19    Sec. 8.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  4 27 the payment of eligible costs of the account holder.  Such
  4 28 withdrawal shall also be assessed a penalty in an amount equal
  4 29 to ten percent of the amount of the withdrawal that represents
  4 30 interest and earnings in the first=time homebuyer savings
  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder

  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining

  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  4 31 account.  The penalty shall not apply to withdrawals made on
  4 32 account of the death of the account holder or for the purpose
  4 33 of paying the eligible costs of the account holder.
  4 34    (2)  For purposes of this paragraph "c", any amount remaining
  4 35 in a first=time homebuyer savings account of an account holder
  5  1 on the day after the purchase of a principal residence or the
  5  2 last business day of the tenth calendar year following the

  5  9 homebuyer savings accounts of the same account holder by a
  5 10 person other than the account holder.
  5 11    (b)  Any amounts withdrawn or otherwise transferred from a
  5 12 first=time homebuyer savings account pursuant to an order in
  5 13 bankruptcy.
  5 14    d.  For purposes of this subsection, "account holder",
  5 15 "eligible costs", and "first=time homebuyer savings account" all
  5 16 mean the same as defined in section 12I.2.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by

  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that

  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless

  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account

  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account

  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax
  8  3 years beginning on or after that date.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.

  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary

  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in

  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and
  8  1 administer the bill.
  8  2    The bill takes effect January 1, 2016, and applies to tax

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account

  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the

  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year

  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill allows first=time homebuyers who are residents
  5 25 of Iowa to establish a first=time homebuyer savings account
  5 26 (account) with a state or federally chartered bank, savings and
  5 27 loan association, credit union, or trust company in this state
  5 28 to finance the purchase of a principal residence in this state.
  5 29 "First=time homebuyer" and "principal residence" are defined in
  5 30 the bill.  The account is required to be an interest=bearing
  5 31 savings account.  The account may be established individually
  5 32 or jointly with the resident's spouse.  However, married
  5 33 taxpayers electing to file separate tax returns or separately
  5 34 on a combined tax return shall not establish or maintain a
  5 35 joint account.
  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer

  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from

  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer
  7 35 of state to each adopt rules to jointly implement and

  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down

  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.

  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by

  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,

  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.

  6  1 There is no limitation on the amount of contributions that
  6  2 may be made to or retained in a first=time homebuyer savings
  6  3 account.  An account holder is required to use the funds in
  6  4 an account for eligible costs related to the purchase of a
  6  5 principal residence within 10 years following the year in which
  6  6 the account is first established.
  6  7    "Eligible costs" are defined in the bill and include the down
  6  8 payment and allowable closing costs of a principal residence
  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives
  7  1 relating to first=time homebuyer savings accounts.  First,
  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.
  7 28    The bill makes it a serious misdemeanor to knowingly prepare
  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
  7 30 to justify the withdrawal of money from a first=time homebuyer
  7 31 savings account.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
  7 32 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  7 33 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  7 34    The bill requires the director of revenue and the treasurer

  6  9 that was purchased after the establishment of the account.  If
  6 10 the account holder withdraws funds for any purpose other than
  6 11 the payment of eligible costs, the account holder is subject to
  6 12 a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of the withdrawal
  6 13 that represents interest and earnings in the account, unless
  6 14 the withdrawal occurs because of the death of the account
  6 15 holder.  The penalty amounts are required to be remitted by the
  6 16 account holder to the department of revenue in the same manner
  6 17 as Code section 422.16(2), relating to the withholding of
  6 18 income tax.  A person ceases to be an account holder following
  6 19 the purchase of a principal residence after the establishment
  6 20 of an account.
  6 21    Accounts are required to be administered by the account
  6 22 holder.  The bill prohibits the account holder from using
  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,
  6 24 but the bill does allow a financial institution where the
  6 25 account is held to charge a service fee.  Documentation
  6 26 regarding the segregation of funds in the account from other
  6 27 funds and documentation regarding eligible costs shall be
  6 28 maintained by the account holder.  The bill also requires the
  6 29 account holder to file reports as required by the department of
  6 30 revenue.  Within 30 days of being furnished proof of death of
  6 31 the account holder, the financial institution where the account
  6 32 is held shall distribute the funds to the estate of the account
  6 33 holder or to a transfer on death or pay on death beneficiary
  6 34 properly designated by the account holder.
  6 35    The bill provides for two individual income tax incentives

  7  2 an account holder is allowed to subtract from the individual
  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount

  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same

  6 23 account funds to pay administrative expenses of the account,

  7  3 income tax the amount of contributions made during the year
  7  4 to the account holder's account, not to exceed $3,000 per
  7  5 individual, or $6,000 for a married couple with a joint account
  7  6 and filing a joint income tax return.  If the account holder
  7  7 contributes more than that amount, the excess may be subtracted
  7  8 in a subsequent tax year provided the total exemption in any
  7  9 one tax year does not exceed $3,000 or $6,000, as applicable.
  7 10 Second, the bill exempts any interest or earnings received from
  7 11 an account holder's account.  Both the contribution exemption
  7 12 and interest exemption only apply for the first 10 years after
  7 13 the account holder establishes an account.
  7 14    The bill requires an account holder to add to net income the
  7 15 amount of withdrawal from an account that was made for purposes
  7 16 other than eligible costs of the account holder to the extent
  7 17 it was previously subtracted as a contribution.  Any amount
  7 18 remaining in an account on the day after an account holder
  7 19 purchases a principal residence or on the last business day of
  7 20 the 10th calendar year following the calendar year the account
  7 21 holder first establishes an account, whichever occurs first,
  7 22 shall be considered a withdrawal that must be added to net
  7 23 income to the extent it was previously subtracted.  However,
  7 24 amounts transferred between different accounts of the same
  7 25 account holder by a person other than the account holder or
  7 26 amounts withdrawn pursuant to an order in bankruptcy shall not
  7 27 be considered withdrawals that must be added to net income.

  7 29 or cause to be prepared a false claim, statement, or billing
