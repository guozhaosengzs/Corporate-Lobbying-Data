The

of

This
bill
relates
to
the
approval
and
imposition
of
the
18


local
option
sales
and
services
tax.
Current
Code
chapter
423B
19


authorizes
the
imposition
of
local
option
taxes,
including
20


a
local
option
sales
and
services
tax.
Currently,
such
a
21


proposed
tax
is
only
presented
to
the
voters
of
a
whole
county
22


upon
the
filing
of
a
petition
signed
by
eligible
electors
of
23


the
county
equal
in
number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
24


the
county
who
voted
at
the
last
preceding
general
election
25


or
upon
receipt
by
the
county
commissioner
of
elections
of
26


motions
requesting
such
submission,
adopted
by
the
governing
27


bodies
of

body
of

for
the

area
of

representing

jurisdiction
if
such
petition
is
signed
by
eligible
electors
1


of
the
city
or
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county,
as
2


applicable,
equal
in
number
to
5
percent
of
the
persons
in
3


the
applicable
city
or
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
who
4


voted
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
The
bill
defines
5


“qualified
county”
to
mean
a
county
with
a
population
in
excess
6


of
400,000,
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
least
60,000
but
7


not
more
than
70,000,
or
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
least
8


46,000
but
not
more
than
48,000,
according
to
the
2010
federal
9


decennial
census.
For
those
qualified
counties,
the
bill
also
10


removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
the
local
sales
11


and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
motions
must
be
12


approved
by
cities
or
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
area,
13


representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
county’s
population.
14


Instead,
the
bill
allows
individual
cities
or
the
county
for
15


the
unincorporated
area
within
a
qualified
county
to
approve
a
16


motion
for
an
election
on
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
to
17


be
held
in
only
that
jurisdiction.
18


The
bill
specifies
that
except
for
purposes
of
allocating
19


local
sales
and
services
tax
receipts
based
on
the
county
in
20


which
the
tax
was
collected,
a
city
shall
be
deemed
to
be
21


located
in
a
qualified
county
if
a
majority
of
the
population
22


of
the
city,
according
to
the
2010
federal
decennial
census,
23


resides
in
the
qualified
county.
24


The
bill
provides
that
in
a
qualified
county
a
city
or
the
25


board
of
supervisors
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
26


may
repeal
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
the
city
upon
27


adoption
of
its
own
motion
for
repeal.
28


For
those
counties
that
are
not
qualified
counties,
the
29


methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
the
local
option
sales
and
30


services
tax
to
the
voters
and
the
methods
for
repealing
such
31


a
tax
remain
the
same
as
required
under
current
Code
chapter
32


423B.

The

provides
