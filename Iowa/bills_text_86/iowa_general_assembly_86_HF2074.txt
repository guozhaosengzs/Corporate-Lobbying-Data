  1 15 other tribunal finds all of the following:
  1 16    a.  A reasonable belief exists that the address is needed to
  1 17 obtain information or evidence without which the investigation,
  1 18 prosecution, or litigation cannot proceed.
  1 19    b.  No other practicable means is available of obtaining the
  1 20 information or evidence from any other source.
  1 21    2.  The court or other tribunal shall provide the program
  1 22 participant with notice that disclosure of the program
  1 23 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  1 24 participant an opportunity to present evidence at a hearing
  1 25 regarding the potential harm to the safety of the program
  1 26 participant if the program participant's address is disclosed.
  1 27 In determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  1 28 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  1 29 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  1 30 in disclosure relating to the investigation, prosecution, or
  1 31 litigation. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  1 32 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  1 33 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  1 34 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a

  2  9 of information other than the program participant's address
  2 10 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  2 11 participant's location.
  2 12    5.  This section shall apply to a participant in an
  2 13 out=of=state address confidentiality program substantially
  2 14 similar to the address confidentiality program established in
  2 15 this chapter.

  2 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 19    This bill relates to the disclosure of an address
  2 20 confidentiality program participant's address in certain legal
  2 21 proceedings.
  2 22    The address confidentiality program was established in
  2 23 the office of the secretary of state (secretary) for persons
  2 24 who are victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault,
  2 25 sexual abuse, stalking, and human trafficking.  Under current
  2 26 law, information collected, created, or maintained by the
  2 27 secretary related to applicants, eligible persons, and
  2 28 program participants in the address confidentiality program is
  2 29 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court, released by
  2 30 a lawful custodian of records, or under certain circumstances
  2 31 relating to public safety. The secretary assigns program
  2 32 participants a designated address (a post office box) to which
  2 33 all mail for a program participant is sent.  "Address" means a
  2 34 residential street address, school address, or work address of
  2 35 an individual, as specified on the individual's application to
  3  1 be a program participant.
  3  2    The bill provides a person shall not be compelled to disclose
  3  3 a program participant's address during discovery or during
  3  4 a proceeding before a court or other tribunal unless the
  3  5 court or other tribunal finds there is a reasonable belief
  3  6 that the address is needed to obtain information or evidence
  3  7 without which the investigation, prosecution, or litigation
  3  8 cannot proceed and there is no other practicable means of
  3  9 obtaining the information or evidence.  The court shall notify
  3 10 the program participant that the disclosure of the program
  3 11 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  3 17 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a
  3 22 witness.  Disclosure is limited under the terms of the order by
  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or
  3 26 litigation.
  3 27    The bill provides that the court or other tribunal is not
  3 28 prevented from issuing a protective order to prevent disclosure
  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.
  3 32    The bill also applies to a participant in an out=of=state
  3 33 address confidentiality program substantially similar to the
  3 34 program established in this Code chapter.

  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the

  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a

  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or

  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.

  2 23 the office of the secretary of state (secretary) for persons
  2 24 who are victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault,
  2 25 sexual abuse, stalking, and human trafficking.  Under current
  2 26 law, information collected, created, or maintained by the
  2 27 secretary related to applicants, eligible persons, and
  2 28 program participants in the address confidentiality program is
  2 29 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court, released by
  2 30 a lawful custodian of records, or under certain circumstances
  2 31 relating to public safety. The secretary assigns program
  2 32 participants a designated address (a post office box) to which
  2 33 all mail for a program participant is sent.  "Address" means a
  2 34 residential street address, school address, or work address of
  2 35 an individual, as specified on the individual's application to
  3  1 be a program participant.
  3  2    The bill provides a person shall not be compelled to disclose
  3  3 a program participant's address during discovery or during
  3  4 a proceeding before a court or other tribunal unless the
  3  5 court or other tribunal finds there is a reasonable belief
  3  6 that the address is needed to obtain information or evidence
  3  7 without which the investigation, prosecution, or litigation
  3  8 cannot proceed and there is no other practicable means of
  3  9 obtaining the information or evidence.  The court shall notify
  3 10 the program participant that the disclosure of the program
  3 11 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  3 17 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a
  3 22 witness.  Disclosure is limited under the terms of the order by
  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or
  3 26 litigation.
  3 27    The bill provides that the court or other tribunal is not
  3 28 prevented from issuing a protective order to prevent disclosure
  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.
  3 32    The bill also applies to a participant in an out=of=state
  3 33 address confidentiality program substantially similar to the
  3 34 program established in this Code chapter.

  2 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 19    This bill relates to the disclosure of an address
  2 20 confidentiality program participant's address in certain legal
  2 21 proceedings.
  2 22    The address confidentiality program was established in
  2 23 the office of the secretary of state (secretary) for persons
  2 24 who are victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault,
  2 25 sexual abuse, stalking, and human trafficking.  Under current
  2 26 law, information collected, created, or maintained by the
  2 27 secretary related to applicants, eligible persons, and
  2 28 program participants in the address confidentiality program is
  2 29 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court, released by
  2 30 a lawful custodian of records, or under certain circumstances
  2 31 relating to public safety. The secretary assigns program
  2 32 participants a designated address (a post office box) to which
  2 33 all mail for a program participant is sent.  "Address" means a
  2 34 residential street address, school address, or work address of
  2 35 an individual, as specified on the individual's application to
  3  1 be a program participant.
  3  2    The bill provides a person shall not be compelled to disclose
  3  3 a program participant's address during discovery or during
  3  4 a proceeding before a court or other tribunal unless the
  3  5 court or other tribunal finds there is a reasonable belief
  3  6 that the address is needed to obtain information or evidence
  3  7 without which the investigation, prosecution, or litigation
  3  8 cannot proceed and there is no other practicable means of
  3  9 obtaining the information or evidence.  The court shall notify
  3 10 the program participant that the disclosure of the program
  3 11 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  3 17 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a
  3 22 witness.  Disclosure is limited under the terms of the order by
  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or
  3 26 litigation.
  3 27    The bill provides that the court or other tribunal is not
  3 28 prevented from issuing a protective order to prevent disclosure
  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.
  3 32    The bill also applies to a participant in an out=of=state

  2 16                           EXPLANATION
  2 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 19    This bill relates to the disclosure of an address
  2 20 confidentiality program participant's address in certain legal
  2 21 proceedings.
  2 22    The address confidentiality program was established in
  2 23 the office of the secretary of state (secretary) for persons
  2 24 who are victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault,
  2 25 sexual abuse, stalking, and human trafficking.  Under current
  2 26 law, information collected, created, or maintained by the
  2 27 secretary related to applicants, eligible persons, and
  2 28 program participants in the address confidentiality program is
  2 29 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court, released by
  2 30 a lawful custodian of records, or under certain circumstances
  2 31 relating to public safety. The secretary assigns program
  2 32 participants a designated address (a post office box) to which
  2 33 all mail for a program participant is sent.  "Address" means a
  2 34 residential street address, school address, or work address of
  2 35 an individual, as specified on the individual's application to
  3  1 be a program participant.
  3  2    The bill provides a person shall not be compelled to disclose
  3  3 a program participant's address during discovery or during
  3  4 a proceeding before a court or other tribunal unless the
  3  5 court or other tribunal finds there is a reasonable belief
  3  6 that the address is needed to obtain information or evidence
  3  7 without which the investigation, prosecution, or litigation
  3  8 cannot proceed and there is no other practicable means of
  3  9 obtaining the information or evidence.  The court shall notify
  3 10 the program participant that the disclosure of the program
  3 11 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  3 17 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a
  3 22 witness.  Disclosure is limited under the terms of the order by
  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or
  3 26 litigation.
  3 27    The bill provides that the court or other tribunal is not
  3 28 prevented from issuing a protective order to prevent disclosure
  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.
  3 32    The bill also applies to a participant in an out=of=state
  3 33 address confidentiality program substantially similar to the
  3 34 program established in this Code chapter.

  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In

  2 19    This bill relates to the disclosure of an address
  2 20 confidentiality program participant's address in certain legal
  2 21 proceedings.
  2 22    The address confidentiality program was established in
  2 23 the office of the secretary of state (secretary) for persons
  2 24 who are victims of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault,
  2 25 sexual abuse, stalking, and human trafficking.  Under current
  2 26 law, information collected, created, or maintained by the
  2 27 secretary related to applicants, eligible persons, and
  2 28 program participants in the address confidentiality program is
  2 29 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court, released by
  2 30 a lawful custodian of records, or under certain circumstances
  2 31 relating to public safety. The secretary assigns program
  2 32 participants a designated address (a post office box) to which
  2 33 all mail for a program participant is sent.  "Address" means a
  2 34 residential street address, school address, or work address of
  2 35 an individual, as specified on the individual's application to
  3  1 be a program participant.
  3  2    The bill provides a person shall not be compelled to disclose
  3  3 a program participant's address during discovery or during
  3  4 a proceeding before a court or other tribunal unless the
  3  5 court or other tribunal finds there is a reasonable belief
  3  6 that the address is needed to obtain information or evidence
  3  7 without which the investigation, prosecution, or litigation
  3  8 cannot proceed and there is no other practicable means of
  3  9 obtaining the information or evidence.  The court shall notify
  3 10 the program participant that the disclosure of the program
  3 11 participant's address is sought and provide the program
  3 12 participant an opportunity for a hearing to present evidence
  3 13 regarding the potential harm to the program participant's
  3 14 safety if the program participant's address is disclosed. In
  3 15 determining whether to compel disclosure, the court or other
  3 16 tribunal shall consider whether the potential harm to the
  3 17 safety of the program participant is outweighed by the interest
  3 18 in disclosure. In a criminal proceeding, the court or other
  3 19 tribunal shall order disclosure of a program participant's
  3 20 address if protecting the program participant's address would
  3 21 violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront a

  3 23 the court or other tribunal to ensure that the disclosure and
  3 24 dissemination of the address will be no wider than necessary
  3 25 for the purposes of the investigation, prosecution, or
  3 26 litigation.
  3 27    The bill provides that the court or other tribunal is not
  3 28 prevented from issuing a protective order to prevent disclosure
  3 29 of information other than the program participant's address
  3 30 that could reasonably lead to the discovery of the program
  3 31 participant's location.
