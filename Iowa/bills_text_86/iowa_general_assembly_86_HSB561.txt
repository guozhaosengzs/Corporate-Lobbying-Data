9


GENERAL.
This
bill
relates
to
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
10


Iowa
beef
cattle
producers
association
(IBCPA).
It
changes
the
11


name
of
its
governing
entity
from
“Iowa
beef
industry
council”
12


(council)
to
“executive
committee”
(committee)
and
adds
two
13


new
voting
members
who
are
producers
appointed
by
the
Iowa
14


cattlemen’s
association
(amended
Code
section
181.3).
The
bill
15


also
eliminates
certain
IBCPA
duties,
including
eliminating
16


requirements
to
conduct
instruction
regarding
the
breeding
and
17


raising
of
cattle
and
to
engage
in
activities
that
demonstrate
18


or
promote
cattle
feeding.
Instead,
the
IBCPA
would
be
19


required
to
engage
in
marketing,
research,
and
education
20


efforts
(Code
section
181.2).
21


TRANSITIONAL
PROVISIONS.
The
bill
does
not
affect
the
22


appointment
or
term
of
office
of
a
current
member
of
the
23


council
due
to
its
name
change
to
a
committee.
It
authorizes
24


the
committee
to
establish
the
initial
terms
of
office
for
25


the
two
new
appointed
members.
Until
the
new
members
are
26


appointed,
the
committee’s
quorum
and
voting
requirements
27


remain
unchanged.
Any
rule
or
other
legal
document
in
effect
28


immediately
prior
to
the
bill’s
effective
date
continues
in
29


full
force
and
effect
until
amended,
rescinded,
or
supplemented
30


by
the
executive
committee
or
it
expires
by
its
own
terms.

BACKGROUND.
Code
chapter
181
provides
that
upon
the
passage
32


of
a
referendum
of
cattle
producers,
there
is
imposed
an
33


assessment,
which
is
an
excise
tax
or
“checkoff”,
on
the
sale
34


of
each
head
of
cattle
paid
by
producers
(Code
sections
181.15

and

collected
by
first
purchasers,
and
forwarded
to
1


the
council
(Code
section
181.11),
but
subject
to
a
producer’s
2


right
to
demand
a
refund
(Code
section
181.12).
The
state
3


checkoff
has
been
superceded
by
a
federal
checkoff
under
the
4


terms
of
the
federal
Beef
Promotion
and
Research
Act
of
1985
5


(7
U.S.C.
§2901
et
seq.).
Under
that
Act,
the
IBCPA
has
6


been
certified
to
serve
as
a
“qualified
state
beef
council”
7


administering
the
federal
checkoff
in
this
state
although
the
8


council
is
authorized
to
seek
certification
(Code
section
9


181.7A).
The
council’s
voting
members
include
five
producers
10


who
are
elected
at
IBCPA’s
annual
meeting
(Code
section
11


181.6A),
one
representative
of
the
Iowa
livestock
auction
12


market
association
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
13


from
two
nominations
submitted
by
that
association
or
another
14


livestock
market
representative,
the
secretary
of
agriculture,

and
the
dean
of
the
college
of
agriculture
and
life
sciences
of

Iowa
