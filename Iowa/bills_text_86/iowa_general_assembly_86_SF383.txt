  7 19 (program) in the office of the secretary of state (secretary)
  7 20 for a victim of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual
  7 21 abuse, or stalking or for a person in fear of the person's
  7 22 safety or another person's safety.
  7 23    CERTIFICATION AND DESIGNATED ADDRESS.  Under the bill, an
  7 24 eligible person may submit an application for enrollment in
  7 25 the program to the secretary of state with certain required
  7 26 information including the applicant's residential address.
  7 27 "Eligible person" is defined as an Iowa resident who is an
  7 28 adult, a minor, or an incapacitated person who is a victim
  7 29 of domestic abuse, domestic abuse assault, sexual abuse, or
  7 30 stalking, as defined in the bill, as evidenced by the filing of
  7 31 a petition for a domestic abuse protective order or a criminal
  7 32 complaint or information involving domestic abuse assault,
  7 33 sexual abuse, or stalking. When the secretary certifies the
  7 34 eligible person's enrollment in the program, the eligible
  7 35 person becomes a program participant for a four=year enrollment
  8  1 period and the secretary assigns the program participant a
  8  2 designated address.  The secretary then forwards all mail sent
  8  3 to the designated address to the program participant at the
  8  4 program participant's preferred address for delivery of mail.
  8  5 When a program participant presents the program participant's
  8  6 designated address to any person, that designated address
  8  7 shall be accepted as the address of the program participant,
  8  8 unless a service or benefit received by the program participant
  8  9 would be impossible to provide without knowledge of the
  8 10 program participant's actual physical location. If a program
  8 11 participant notifies a person in writing that the individual is
  8 12 a program participant, the person is prohibited from knowingly
  8 13 disclosing the program participant's address unless certain
  8 14 circumstances apply.
  8 15    The bill provides that the secretary or the secretary's
  8 16 designee shall not be liable for acts or omission relating to
  8 17 the administration of the program.
  8 18    CERTIFICATION CANCELLATION.  The bill specifies
  8 19 circumstances under which the secretary may cancel a program
  8 20 participant's certification, including due to a legal name
  8 21 change or a change in contact information, undeliverable mail,
  8 22 eligibility requirement changes, and false information in the
  8 23 program participant's application.
  8 24    CONFIDENTIALITY.  The bill provides that information
  8 25 collected, created, or maintained by the secretary related
  8 26 to applicants, eligible persons, and program participants is
  8 27 confidential unless otherwise ordered by a court or released
  8 28 by the lawful custodian of the records pursuant to state or
  8 29 federal law.  Upon request from the department of public
  8 30 safety, the secretary may share confidential information
  8 31 with the department of public safety for release to a law
  8 32 enforcement agency upon verification that the release will
  8 33 aid the law enforcement agency in responding to an emergency
  8 34 situation, a criminal complaint, or an ongoing investigation.
  8 35 In addition, if a program participant has notified the program
  9  1 participant's landlord in writing that the individual is a
  9  2 program participant pursuant to the bill, a local ordinance
  9  3 or the landlord shall not require the display of the program
  9  4 participant's name at an address otherwise protected under the
  9  5 bill.
  9  6    VOTING BY PROGRAM PARTICIPANT.  The bill provides that a
  9  7 program participant who is an eligible elector may register
  9  8 to vote with the state commissioner of elections, although
  9  9 the name, residential address, and telephone number of a

  9 11 voter registration system.  A program participant who is
  9 12 otherwise eligible to vote may annually register with the state
  9 13 commissioner of elections as an absentee voter.  If the ballot
  9 14 materials completed by a program participant comply with the
  9 15 requirements of the bill, the materials shall be certified
  9 16 by the state commissioner of elections as the ballot of the
  9 17 program participant, and shall be forwarded to the appropriate
  9 18 county commissioner of elections for tabulation by the special
  9 19 voters precinct election board.  The bill makes conforming
  9 20 changes to voter registration provisions.
