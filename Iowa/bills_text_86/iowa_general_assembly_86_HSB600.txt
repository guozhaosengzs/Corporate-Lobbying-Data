The

the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

This
bill
relates
to
the
confidentiality
of
juvenile
court
9


records.
10


Under
current
law,
juvenile
court
records
in
cases
alleging
11


delinquency
are
public
records
unless
a
judge
grants
a
request
12


to
make
the
records
confidential
or
seals
the
records.
13


The
bill
amends
current
law
and
provides
that
juvenile
14


court
records
in
cases
alleging
delinquency
are
confidential
15


unless
a
judge
grants
a
request
to
make
the
juvenile
court
16


records
public
if
the
court
finds,
after
a
hearing
held
prior
17


to
disposition,
that
making
the
records
public
is
in
the
18


best
interests
of
the
juvenile
and
the
public.
A
rebuttable
19


presumption
exists
that
the
juvenile
court
delinquency
records
20


shall
remain
confidential.
Even
if
a
child’s
juvenile
court
21


delinquency
records
are
confidential,
a
court
may,
after
a
22


hearing,
order
such
records
to
be
made
public
records
if
the
23


child
is
subsequently
convicted
of
a
felony
or
an
aggravated
24


or
serious
misdemeanor
or
adjudicated
a
delinquent
child
for
25


an
act
which
if
committed
by
an
adult
would
be
a
felony
or
26


an
aggravated
or
serious
misdemeanor,
or
if
the
child
was
27


placed
on
youthful
offender
status,
transferred
back
to
the
28


district
court
after
the
youthful
offender’s
18th
birthday,
29


and
sentenced
for
the
offense
which
precipitated
the
youthful
30


offender
placement.
The
bill
provides
that
a
child
has
the
31


right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
during
a
public
records
32


order
hearing,
even
if
such
hearing
occurs
after
the
child’s
33


18th
birthday.
If
a
judge
orders
such
records
to
be
public,
34


the
records
may
still
be
