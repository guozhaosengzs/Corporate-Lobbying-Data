for
the
issuance
of
a
protective
order
in
criminal
proceedings.
8


The
bill
amends
a
related
provision
allowing
the
court
to
issue
9


a
no-contact
order
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
a
protective
10


order.
11


Current
law
allows
a
court
to
issue
a
temporary
no-contact
12


order
and
a
permanent
no-contact
order.
The
bill
eliminates
13


the
distinction
between
temporary
and
permanent
no-contact
14


orders.
15


Current
law
provides
for
a
mandatory
arrest
procedure
for
16


violations
of
no-contact
orders
but
not
for
violations
of
17


protective
orders.
The
bill
amends
this
provision
to
provide
18


that
a
person
who
violates
a
protective
order
is
also
subject
19


to
mandatory
arrest.
20


Under
current
law,
if
a
person
violates
a
no-contact
order
or
21


a
protective
order,
the
person
may
be
charged
with
a
criminal
22


offense
(simple
misdemeanor)
or
may
be
held
to
be
in
contempt
23


of
court.
The
bill
eliminates
the
criminal
offense
option
24


for
violations
of
no-contact
orders
or
protective
orders.
A
25


person
held
in
contempt
for
a
violation
of
a
no-contact
order
26


is
subject
to
confinement
in
the
county
jail
for
a
minimum
of
27


seven
days
and
a
maximum
of
180
days
per
violation.
A
fine
may
28


also
be
imposed
in
addition
to
the
minimum
sentence.
A
person
29


held
in
contempt
for
a
violation
of
a
protective
order
shall
30


serve
a
jail
sentence,
and
may
be
ordered
by
the
court
to
pay
31


the
plaintiff’s
attorney
fees
and
court
costs.
32


The
bill
provides
that
a
no-contact
order
may
only
be
33


terminated
or
modified
upon
petition
by
the
state
or
the
34


protected
party.
