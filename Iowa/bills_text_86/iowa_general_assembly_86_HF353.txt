  1 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 13    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill reduces from three to two
  1 14 the number of hours of continuing education that a commercial
  1 15 manure service representative must attend in lieu of passing
  1 16 an examination, in order to be certified by the department of
  1 17 natural resources (DNR).  The continuing education hours would
  1 18 equal the number of hours of required attendance by confinement
  1 19 site manure applicators.
  1 20    BACKGROUND.  The provision amended by the bill (Code section
  1 21 459.315) is part of the "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act"
  1 22 (Code section 459.101).  There are two classes of persons
  1 23 required to be certified in order to manage manure:  (1)
  1 24 persons associated with a service engaged in the business of
  1 25 transporting, handling, storing, or applying manure, and (2)
  1 26 persons involved in livestock production and specifically
  1 27 confinement feeding operations who are engaged in the
  1 28 application of manure originating from their operations (see
  1 29 Code section 459.102 defining a "commercial manure service
  1 30 representative" and "confinement site manure applicator").
  1 31 In both cases, the person must either pass an examination or
  1 32 annually attend a designated number of continuing instruction
  1 33 courses.  A commercial manure service representative is
  1 34 required to attend three hours and a confinement site
  1 35 manure applicator is required to attend two hours. The Iowa
  2  1 cooperative extension service in agriculture and home economics
