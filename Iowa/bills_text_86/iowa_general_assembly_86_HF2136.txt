  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    This bill modifies provisions that require school districts
  2 18 to retain in the third grade certain students, and adds a
  2 19 provision to require school districts to offer, under certain
  2 20 conditions, an intensive summer reading program for students in
  2 21 kindergarten through grade two whose reading is deficient.
  2 22    Currently, beginning in the summer of 2017, if a student
  2 23 is identified by a school district as having a substantial
  2 24 deficiency in reading, and the student's reading deficiency is
  2 25 not remedied by the end of grade three, the school district,
  2 26 unless it has obtained a waiver from the department of
  2 27 education, must notify the student's parent or guardian that
  2 28 the parent or guardian may enroll the student in an intensive
  2 29 summer reading program.  The bill delays the requirement until
  2 30 the summer of 2018 and provides that notification must be in
  2 31 writing.
  2 32    The bill also delays to 2018 provisions relating to
  2 33 a requirement that school districts retain a student in
