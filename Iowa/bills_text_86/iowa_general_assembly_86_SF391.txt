  1  3                           EXPLANATION
  1  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  6    This bill eliminates a provision prohibiting a peace officer
  1  7 from stopping or detaining a person solely for a violation of
  1  8 Code section 321.276, which relates to texting while driving.
  1  9    The scheduled fine for a violation of Code section 321.276
  1 10 remains $30. Under current law, the offense is not a moving
  1 11 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  1 12 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  1 13 habitual offender status. However, if the violation causes a
  1 14 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  1 15 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  1 16 days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
  1 17 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  1 18 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.

  1  2 amended by striking the subsection.

  1  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  6    This bill eliminates a provision prohibiting a peace officer
  1  7 from stopping or detaining a person solely for a violation of
  1  8 Code section 321.276, which relates to texting while driving.
  1  9    The scheduled fine for a violation of Code section 321.276
  1 10 remains $30. Under current law, the offense is not a moving
  1 11 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  1 12 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  1 13 habitual offender status. However, if the violation causes a
  1 14 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  1 15 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  1 16 days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
  1 17 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  1 18 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
