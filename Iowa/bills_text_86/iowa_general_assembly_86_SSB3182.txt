9


a
notice
of
the
intent
to
cease

at
the
start
of
10


the
next
fiscal
year.
If
a
county
ceases
collection
efforts
11


under
the
bill,
or
if
the
state
court
administrator
provides
12


notice
that
a
county
attorney
collections
program
has
become
13


ineligible
to
collect
delinquent

the

any
existing
installment
agreement
remains

19


The
bill
and
current
law
provide
that
the
county
attorney
20


is
not
eligible
to
retain
certain
court
debt
specified
in
Code
21


section
602.8107(4)(a).
Code
section
602.8107(2)(c)
continues
22


to
govern
the
prioritized
application
of
court
debt
receipts.
23


The
bill
and
current
law
provide
for
a
two-tier
distribution
24


formula
if
a
county
attorney
decides
to
collect
delinquent
25


court
debt.
Current
law
and
the
bill
provide
for
one
26


distribution
formula
to
the
county
and
the
state
when
the
27


county
attorney
collects
below
a
certain
threshold
dollar
28


amount
and
a
different
distribution
formula
when
a
county
29


attorney
exceeds
that
certain
threshold
dollar
amount.
The
30


bill
makes
three
major
changes
to
the
county
attorney
court
31


debt
collection
formula.


32


First,
the
bill
requires
28
percent
of
the
distributable
33


amount
of
court
debt
collected
by
the
county
attorney
to
be
34


deposited
into
the
county
general
fund.
Current
law
requires
35


-9-

S.F.
_____


40
percent
of
the
distributable
amount
of
court
debt
collected
1


by
the
county
attorney
to
be
deposited
into
the
county
general
2


fund.
Current
law
and
the
bill
provide
that
the
remaining
3


court
debt
not
deposited
into
the
county
general
fund
be
paid
4


to
the
clerk
of
district
court
for
distribution
under
Code
5


section
602.8108.
Under
the
bill,
this
remaining
court
debt
6


is
72
percent
of
the
distributable
amount
of
court
debt
and
7


is
required
to
be
paid
to
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
for
8


distribution
under
Code
section
602.8108.
9


Second,
the
bill
changes
the
threshold
dollar
amounts
10


that
are
in
place
to
further
incentivize
a
county
attorney
11


to
continue
collecting
delinquent
court
debt.
The
threshold
12


dollar
amount
depends
on
the
population
size
of
the
county.
13


The
bill
changes
the
threshold
dollar
amount
for
a
county
with
14


a
population
greater
than
150,000
from
$500,000
to
$1
million.
15


The
bill
changes
the
threshold
dollar
amount
for
a
county
with
16


a
population
greater
than
100,000
but
not
more
than
150,000
17


from
$400,000
to
$600,000.
The
bill
changes
the
threshold
18


dollar
amount
for
a
county
with
a
population
greater
than
19


50,000
but
not
more
than
100,000
from
$250,000
to
$300,000.
20


The
remaining
threshold
amounts
for
the
less
populated
counties
21


are
not
changed
by
the
bill
and
are
specified
in
Code
section
22


602.8107(4)(c)(2).
23


Third,
after
a
county
attorney’s
collection
of
delinquent
24


court
debt
exceeds
the
threshold
dollar
amount
and
for
the
25


remainder
of
the
fiscal
year,
the
bill
requires
5
percent
of
26


the
distributable
amount
of
court
debt
collected
by
the
county
27


attorney
to
be
deposited
with
the
office
of
the
county
attorney
28


that
collected
the
debt.
Current
law
requires
12
percent
of
29


the
distributable
amount
of
court
debt
to
be
deposited
with
the
30


office
of
the
county
attorney.
In
addition
to
the
5
percent
31


of
distributable
court
debt
deposited
with
the
office
of
the
32


county
attorney
that
collected
the
debt,
the
bill
requires
28
33


percent
of
the
distributable
amount
of
court
debt
collected
34


by
the
county
attorney
after

be
paid

for

under

Code
section

Under
the
bill,
after
exceeding
the

threshold
dollar
amount,
67
percent
of
the
court
debt
remains
7


to
be
paid
to
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
for
distribution
8


under
Code
section
602.8108.
9


The
bill
provides
that
any
county
that
enters
into
a
Code
10


chapter
28E
agreement
with
another
county
or
counties
to
11


collect
delinquent
court
debt,
must
collect
an
amount
in
12


excess
of
the
applicable
threshold
dollar
amount
for
that
13


particular
county
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
second
tier
of
14


the
distribution
formula
and
the
5
percent
distribution
to
the
15


office
of
the
county
attorney.
The

The

a
county
20


attorney
shall
be
required
to
collect
100
percent
of
the
21


applicable
threshold
dollar
amount
within
two
years
of
22


beginning
to
collect
delinquent

The
bill
provides
23


that
if
the
county

collects
more
than
80
percent
24


but
less
than
100
percent
of
the
applicable
threshold
dollar
25


amount,
the
state
court
administrator
shall
provide
notice
to
26


the
county
attorney
specifying
that

at
least
125
percent
of
the
29


applicable

notice
fails

percent
of
the
