  1 20      1 20      1 21 is a new development revitalization area, the governing body
  1 22 of each local taxing authority authorized to certify a levy on
  1 23 property located within the area comprising the revitalization
  1 24 area has adopted a resolution authorizing the designation of
  1 25 the revitalization area.
  1 26    b.  For the purposes of this subsection, "new development
  1 27 revitalization area" means a revitalization area established
  1 28 on or after July 1, 2015, that meets all of the following
  1 29 conditions:
  1 30    (1)  Is designated in whole or in part under section 404.1,

  1 32 than fifty percent of the property meets the description of
  1 33 conditions under section 404.1, subsections 1 and 2.

  2  3 within the city limits or is established by a county and covers
  2  4 all unincorporated areas of the county.
  2  5    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to revitalization

  2 10    This bill relates to the revitalization areas and property
  2 11 tax exemptions approved by cities and counties under Code
  2 12 chapter 404.
  2 13    The bill modifies some of the grounds under which a city
  2 14 or county may designate a revitalization area.  Current Code
  2 15 section 404.1 provides, in part, that the governing body of
  2 16 a city or county may designate an area as a revitalization
  2 17 area, if that area is an area which by reason of the presence
  2 18 of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
  2 19 structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street
  2 20 layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot layout
  2 21 in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness,
  2 22 unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or
  2 23 other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special
  2 24 assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of the land,
  2 25 defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
  2 26 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
  2 27 causes, or a combination of such factors, substantially impairs
  2 28 or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the
  2 29 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic
  2 30 or social liability and is a menace to the public health,
  2 31 safety, or welfare in its present condition and use.  The bill
  2 32 strikes portions of that provision relating to predominance of
  2 33 defective or inadequate street layout, incompatible land use
  2 34 relationships, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy,
  2 35 accessibility or usefulness, diversity of ownership, tax or
  3  1 special assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of
  3  2 the land, and defective or unusual conditions of title.
  3  3    The bill also amends provisions relating to the approval
  3  4 requirements for revitalization areas under Code section 404.2.
  3  5 The bill provides that if the proposed revitalization area
  3  6 is a "new development revitalization area", the governing
  3  7 body of each local taxing authority authorized to certify
  3  8 a levy on property located within the area comprising the
  3  9 revitalization area must first adopt a resolution authorizing
  3 10 the designation of the revitalization area. The bill defines
  3 11 "new development revitalization area" to be a revitalization
  3 12 area established on or after July 1, 2015, that meets all of
  3 13 the following conditions: (1) is designated in whole or in

  3 15 to housing and residential development, or construction of
  3 16 housing and residential development, including single or

  2 15 section 404.1 provides, in part, that the governing body of
  2 16 a city or county may designate an area as a revitalization
  2 17 area, if that area is an area which by reason of the presence
  2 18 of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
  2 19 structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street
  2 20 layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot layout
  2 21 in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness,
  2 22 unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or
  2 23 other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special
  2 24 assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of the land,
  2 25 defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
  2 26 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
  2 27 causes, or a combination of such factors, substantially impairs
  2 28 or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the
  2 29 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic
  2 30 or social liability and is a menace to the public health,
  2 31 safety, or welfare in its present condition and use.  The bill
  2 32 strikes portions of that provision relating to predominance of

  2 34 relationships, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy,
  2 35 accessibility or usefulness, diversity of ownership, tax or

  3  2 the land, and defective or unusual conditions of title.

  3  8 a levy on property located within the area comprising the

  2  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    This bill relates to the revitalization areas and property
  2 11 tax exemptions approved by cities and counties under Code
  2 12 chapter 404.
  2 13    The bill modifies some of the grounds under which a city
  2 14 or county may designate a revitalization area.  Current Code
  2 15 section 404.1 provides, in part, that the governing body of
  2 16 a city or county may designate an area as a revitalization
  2 17 area, if that area is an area which by reason of the presence
  2 18 of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
  2 19 structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street
  2 20 layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot layout
  2 21 in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness,
  2 22 unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or
  2 23 other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special
  2 24 assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of the land,
  2 25 defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
  2 26 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
  2 27 causes, or a combination of such factors, substantially impairs
  2 28 or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the
  2 29 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic
  2 30 or social liability and is a menace to the public health,
  2 31 safety, or welfare in its present condition and use.  The bill
  2 32 strikes portions of that provision relating to predominance of
  2 33 defective or inadequate street layout, incompatible land use
  2 34 relationships, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy,
  2 35 accessibility or usefulness, diversity of ownership, tax or
  3  1 special assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of
  3  2 the land, and defective or unusual conditions of title.
  3  3    The bill also amends provisions relating to the approval
  3  4 requirements for revitalization areas under Code section 404.2.
  3  5 The bill provides that if the proposed revitalization area
  3  6 is a "new development revitalization area", the governing
  3  7 body of each local taxing authority authorized to certify
  3  8 a levy on property located within the area comprising the
  3  9 revitalization area must first adopt a resolution authorizing
  3 10 the designation of the revitalization area. The bill defines
  3 11 "new development revitalization area" to be a revitalization
  3 12 area established on or after July 1, 2015, that meets all of
  3 13 the following conditions: (1) is designated in whole or in
  3 14 part as an area appropriate for public improvements related
  3 15 to housing and residential development, or construction of
  3 16 housing and residential development, including single or

  2  7                           EXPLANATION
  2  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    This bill relates to the revitalization areas and property
  2 11 tax exemptions approved by cities and counties under Code
  2 12 chapter 404.
  2 13    The bill modifies some of the grounds under which a city
  2 14 or county may designate a revitalization area.  Current Code
  2 15 section 404.1 provides, in part, that the governing body of
  2 16 a city or county may designate an area as a revitalization
  2 17 area, if that area is an area which by reason of the presence
  2 18 of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
  2 19 structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street
  2 20 layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot layout
  2 21 in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness,
  2 22 unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or
  2 23 other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special
  2 24 assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of the land,
  2 25 defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
  2 26 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
  2 27 causes, or a combination of such factors, substantially impairs
  2 28 or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the
  2 29 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic
  2 30 or social liability and is a menace to the public health,
  2 31 safety, or welfare in its present condition and use.  The bill
  2 32 strikes portions of that provision relating to predominance of
  2 33 defective or inadequate street layout, incompatible land use
  2 34 relationships, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy,
  2 35 accessibility or usefulness, diversity of ownership, tax or
  3  1 special assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of
  3  2 the land, and defective or unusual conditions of title.
  3  3    The bill also amends provisions relating to the approval
  3  4 requirements for revitalization areas under Code section 404.2.
  3  5 The bill provides that if the proposed revitalization area
  3  6 is a "new development revitalization area", the governing
  3  7 body of each local taxing authority authorized to certify
  3  8 a levy on property located within the area comprising the
  3  9 revitalization area must first adopt a resolution authorizing
  3 10 the designation of the revitalization area. The bill defines
  3 11 "new development revitalization area" to be a revitalization
  3 12 area established on or after July 1, 2015, that meets all of
  3 13 the following conditions: (1) is designated in whole or in

  2 11 tax exemptions approved by cities and counties under Code

  2 13    The bill modifies some of the grounds under which a city
  2 14 or county may designate a revitalization area.  Current Code
  2 15 section 404.1 provides, in part, that the governing body of

  2 17 area, if that area is an area which by reason of the presence
  2 18 of a substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating
  2 19 structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street
  2 20 layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot layout
  2 21 in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness,

  2 23 other improvements, diversity of ownership, tax or special
  2 24 assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of the land,
  2 25 defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
  2 26 conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
  2 27 causes, or a combination of such factors, substantially impairs
  2 28 or arrests the sound growth of a municipality, retards the
  2 29 provision of housing accommodations or constitutes an economic
  2 30 or social liability and is a menace to the public health,
  2 31 safety, or welfare in its present condition and use.  The bill
  2 32 strikes portions of that provision relating to predominance of
  2 33 defective or inadequate street layout, incompatible land use
  2 34 relationships, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy,
  2 35 accessibility or usefulness, diversity of ownership, tax or
  3  1 special assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of
  3  2 the land, and defective or unusual conditions of title.
  3  3    The bill also amends provisions relating to the approval
  3  4 requirements for revitalization areas under Code section 404.2.
  3  5 The bill provides that if the proposed revitalization area
  3  6 is a "new development revitalization area", the governing
  3  7 body of each local taxing authority authorized to certify
  3  8 a levy on property located within the area comprising the
  3  9 revitalization area must first adopt a resolution authorizing
  3 10 the designation of the revitalization area. The bill defines
  3 11 "new development revitalization area" to be a revitalization

  3 13 the following conditions: (1) is designated in whole or in

  3 18 property that meets the description under Code section 404.1,
