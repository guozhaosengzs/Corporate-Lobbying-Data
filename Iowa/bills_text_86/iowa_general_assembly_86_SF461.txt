 12 35                           EXPLANATION
 13  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  3    This bill relates to the coordination of and availability of
 13  4 broadband access via fiberoptic network infrastructure across
 13  5 the state.
 13  6    Division I of the bill modifies provisions in Code chapter
 13  7 8B, the information technology chapter which creates the office
 13  8 of the chief information officer, by adding several definitions
 13  9 to the Code chapter.  The division defines "broadband" as
 13 10 a high=speed, high=capacity electronic transmission medium
 13 11 that can carry data signals from multiple independent network
 13 12 sources by establishing different bandwidth channels and that
 13 13 is commonly used to deliver internet services to the public.
 13 14 The division defines "fiberoptic network infrastructure" as the
 13 15 physical infrastructure used for the transmission of data via
 13 16 broadband over fiberoptic networks.  The division also adds
 13 17 definitions for "communications service provider" and "targeted
 13 18 underserved service area".  The division changes the definition
 13 19 of "information technology" to include broadband and fiberoptic
 13 20 network infrastructure.
 13 21    The division adds additional powers and duties for the
 13 22 chief information officer relating to broadband and fiberoptic
 13 23 network infrastructure.  The division includes coordination
 13 24 of statewide broadband availability and access via fiberoptic
 13 25 network infrastructure as a mission of the office of the chief
 13 26 information officer.  The division also requires the chief
 13 27 information officer to streamline, consolidate, and coordinate
 13 28 access to and availability of broadband via fiberoptic network
 13 29 infrastructure.  The division directs the chief information
 13 30 officer to submit an annual report regarding the status of
 13 31 broadband expansion and coordination via fiberoptic networks
 13 32 and the broadband grant program.  The division also adds the
 13 33 chief information officer as a nonvoting, ex officio member to
 13 34 the telecommunication and technology commission, established in
 13 35 current Code section 8D.3 and which oversees the operation of
 14  1 the Iowa communications network, and adds the chief information
 14  2 officer as a voting member of the statewide interoperable
 14  3 communications system board established in current Code
 14  4 section 80.28 under the purview of the departments of public
 14  5 safety and transportation.  The division makes corresponding
 14  6 amendments regarding voting members of the commission and the
 14  7 appointment of the executive director of the telecommunication
 14  8 and technology commission. The division also adds an emergency
 14  9 care provider, a local emergency management coordinator, and
 14 10 a person representing the communication workers of America
 14 11 in Iowa to the statewide interoperable communications system
 14 12 board.
 14 13    The division establishes a broadband grant program and fund.
 14 14 The division requires the office of the chief information
 14 15 officer to administer a broadband grant program to award grants
 14 16 to communication service providers that reduce or eliminate
 14 17 targeted underserved service areas by providing broadband
 14 18 services via fiberoptic network infrastructure.  The division
 14 19 establishes a fund, consisting of moneys appropriated to it or
 14 20 appropriated to the office or otherwise available to the office
 14 21 for purposes of the grant program.  The moneys in the fund are
 14 22 appropriated to the office of the chief information officer.
 14 23 The division provides that communication service providers may
 14 24 apply to the office for a grant.  The division requires the
 14 25 office to include representatives from schools, communities,
 14 26 agriculture, industry, and other areas as appropriate to
 14 27 review and recommend grant awards.  The division also requires
 14 28 the office to conduct an open application review process and
 14 29 include a public internet site for applications, results,
 14 30 and performance.  The division sets criteria for the office
 14 31 to consider when awarding grants.  The division limits grant
 14 32 amounts to a maximum of 10 percent of the communication service
 14 33 provider's project cost.
 14 34    The division adds the responsibility for coordinating a new
 14 35 fiberoptic network conduit installation program to facilitate
 15  1 incorporation of fiberoptic network conduit installations, as
 15  2 defined by the bill, into state=funded construction projects or
 15  3 by state=owned infrastructure to the powers and duties of the
 15  4 chief information officer.  The division provides that, subject
 15  5 to funding from the general assembly, the office may contract
 15  6 with a third party to manage, lease, install, or otherwise
 15  7 provide fiberoptic network conduit access, and the program
 15  8 shall not prohibit the office from purchasing or installing
 15  9 fiberoptic cable within fiberoptic network conduit installed
 15 10 pursuant to the program.
 15 11    Additionally, the division specifies expeditious response
 15 12 requirements regarding the approval, modification, or
 15 13 disapproval of nonwireless broadband=related permits.  The
 15 14 division provides that, notwithstanding any other provision to
 15 15 the contrary, a political subdivision vested with permitting
 15 16 authority shall approve, approve with modification, or
 15 17 disapprove nonwireless broadband=related permits within 60
 15 18 business days following the submission of a permit application
 15 19 and fee.  If the political subdivision does not take action
 15 20 during the 60=day period, the application shall be deemed
 15 21 approved.
 15 22    Division II of the bill provides a property tax exemption for
 15 23 installation of fiberoptic network infrastructure commenced and
 15 24 completed on or after July 1, 2015, in a targeted underserved
 15 25 service area and used to deliver internet services to the
 15 26 public.  The exemption shall be a 100 percent exemption from
 15 27 taxation for a period of five years based on the actual
 15 28 value added by the installation of the fiberoptic network
 15 29 infrastructure.  The division specifies procedures relating to
 15 30 applying for the tax exemption with the board of supervisors in
 15 31 the county within which the fiberoptic network infrastructure
 15 32 is located, granting the tax exemption, and assessing the
 15 33 property of companies receiving the exemption.  The division
 15 34 applies to assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 15 35 2016.  Code section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax
 16  1 credit or exemption enacted on or after January 1, 1997, if a
 16  2 state appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
 16  3 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
 16  4 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
 16  5 that portion of the credit or exemption estimated by the
 16  6 department of revenue to be funded by the state appropriation.
 16  7 The division provides that Code section 25B.7 does not apply to
 16  8 the property tax exemption created under the division.

 13  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  3    This bill relates to the coordination of and availability of
 13  4 broadband access via fiberoptic network infrastructure across
 13  5 the state.
 13  6    Division I of the bill modifies provisions in Code chapter
 13  7 8B, the information technology chapter which creates the office
 13  8 of the chief information officer, by adding several definitions
 13  9 to the Code chapter.  The division defines "broadband" as
 13 10 a high=speed, high=capacity electronic transmission medium
 13 11 that can carry data signals from multiple independent network
 13 12 sources by establishing different bandwidth channels and that
 13 13 is commonly used to deliver internet services to the public.
 13 14 The division defines "fiberoptic network infrastructure" as the
 13 15 physical infrastructure used for the transmission of data via
 13 16 broadband over fiberoptic networks.  The division also adds
 13 17 definitions for "communications service provider" and "targeted
 13 18 underserved service area".  The division changes the definition
 13 19 of "information technology" to include broadband and fiberoptic
 13 20 network infrastructure.
 13 21    The division adds additional powers and duties for the
 13 22 chief information officer relating to broadband and fiberoptic
 13 23 network infrastructure.  The division includes coordination
 13 24 of statewide broadband availability and access via fiberoptic
 13 25 network infrastructure as a mission of the office of the chief
 13 26 information officer.  The division also requires the chief
 13 27 information officer to streamline, consolidate, and coordinate
 13 28 access to and availability of broadband via fiberoptic network
 13 29 infrastructure.  The division directs the chief information
 13 30 officer to submit an annual report regarding the status of
 13 31 broadband expansion and coordination via fiberoptic networks
 13 32 and the broadband grant program.  The division also adds the
 13 33 chief information officer as a nonvoting, ex officio member to
 13 34 the telecommunication and technology commission, established in
 13 35 current Code section 8D.3 and which oversees the operation of
 14  1 the Iowa communications network, and adds the chief information
 14  2 officer as a voting member of the statewide interoperable
 14  3 communications system board established in current Code
 14  4 section 80.28 under the purview of the departments of public
 14  5 safety and transportation.  The division makes corresponding
 14  6 amendments regarding voting members of the commission and the
 14  7 appointment of the executive director of the telecommunication
 14  8 and technology commission. The division also adds an emergency
 14  9 care provider, a local emergency management coordinator, and
 14 10 a person representing the communication workers of America
 14 11 in Iowa to the statewide interoperable communications system
 14 12 board.

 14 14 The division requires the office of the chief information
 14 15 officer to administer a broadband grant program to award grants
 14 16 to communication service providers that reduce or eliminate
 14 17 targeted underserved service areas by providing broadband
 14 18 services via fiberoptic network infrastructure.  The division
 14 19 establishes a fund, consisting of moneys appropriated to it or
 14 20 appropriated to the office or otherwise available to the office
 14 21 for purposes of the grant program.  The moneys in the fund are
 14 22 appropriated to the office of the chief information officer.
 14 23 The division provides that communication service providers may
 14 24 apply to the office for a grant.  The division requires the
 14 25 office to include representatives from schools, communities,
 14 26 agriculture, industry, and other areas as appropriate to
 14 27 review and recommend grant awards.  The division also requires
 14 28 the office to conduct an open application review process and
 14 29 include a public internet site for applications, results,
 14 30 and performance.  The division sets criteria for the office
 14 31 to consider when awarding grants.  The division limits grant
 14 32 amounts to a maximum of 10 percent of the communication service
 14 33 provider's project cost.
 14 34    The division adds the responsibility for coordinating a new
 14 35 fiberoptic network conduit installation program to facilitate
 15  1 incorporation of fiberoptic network conduit installations, as
 15  2 defined by the bill, into state=funded construction projects or
 15  3 by state=owned infrastructure to the powers and duties of the
 15  4 chief information officer.  The division provides that, subject
 15  5 to funding from the general assembly, the office may contract
 15  6 with a third party to manage, lease, install, or otherwise
 15  7 provide fiberoptic network conduit access, and the program
 15  8 shall not prohibit the office from purchasing or installing
 15  9 fiberoptic cable within fiberoptic network conduit installed
 15 10 pursuant to the program.
 15 11    Additionally, the division specifies expeditious response
 15 12 requirements regarding the approval, modification, or
 15 13 disapproval of nonwireless broadband=related permits.  The
 15 14 division provides that, notwithstanding any other provision to
 15 15 the contrary, a political subdivision vested with permitting
 15 16 authority shall approve, approve with modification, or
 15 17 disapprove nonwireless broadband=related permits within 60
 15 18 business days following the submission of a permit application
 15 19 and fee.  If the political subdivision does not take action
 15 20 during the 60=day period, the application shall be deemed
 15 21 approved.
 15 22    Division II of the bill provides a property tax exemption for
 15 23 installation of fiberoptic network infrastructure commenced and
 15 24 completed on or after July 1, 2015, in a targeted underserved
 15 25 service area and used to deliver internet services to the
 15 26 public.  The exemption shall be a 100 percent exemption from
 15 27 taxation for a period of five years based on the actual
 15 28 value added by the installation of the fiberoptic network
 15 29 infrastructure.  The division specifies procedures relating to
 15 30 applying for the tax exemption with the board of supervisors in
 15 31 the county within which the fiberoptic network infrastructure
 15 32 is located, granting the tax exemption, and assessing the
 15 33 property of companies receiving the exemption.  The division
 15 34 applies to assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
 15 35 2016.  Code section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax
 16  1 credit or exemption enacted on or after January 1, 1997, if a
 16  2 state appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
 16  3 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
 16  4 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
 16  5 that portion of the credit or exemption estimated by the
 16  6 department of revenue to be funded by the state appropriation.
 16  7 The division provides that Code section 25B.7 does not apply to
 16  8 the property tax exemption created under the division.
