  4 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    This bill relates to elections administration with respect
  4 15 to the address confidentiality program administered by the
  4 16 secretary of state, to satellite absentee voting, and to the
  4 17 conduct of school district elections.
  4 18    Relating to the state's address confidentiality program, the
  4 19 bill provides that a program participant's voter registration
  4 20 is not subject to challenge based on participation in the
  4 21 program and the use of a designated address nor is it allowed
  4 22 to be the basis for challenges under Code sections 49.79
  4 23 (election day voting) or 53.31 (absentee voting). In the case
  4 24 of an election contest, the bill provides for the certification
  4 25 of a program participant's eligibility to vote and the validity
  4 26 of a program participant's absentee ballot. The bill also
  4 27 provides that the deposition of a program participant shall
  4 28 serve as testimony in a contested election.
  4 29    Relating to satellite absentee voting, current law prohibits
  4 30 electioneering within the sight or hearing of voters at the
  4 31 satellite absentee voting station. Under current Code section
  4 32 39A.4, subsection 1, electioneering and other specified
  4 33 activity is prohibited on the premises of a polling place or
  4 34 within 300 feet of an outside door of a building affording
  4 35 access to a room where the polls are held, or of an outside

  5  2 stairway, or other means of reaching the room where the polls
  5  3 are held. The bill provides that a satellite absentee voting
  5  4 station and an absentee voting site at a county commissioner of
  5  5 elections office are also polling places for purposes of Code
  5  6 section 39A.4, subsection 1.
  5  7    Relating to school district elections, the bill requires
  5  8 that a plan for school district reorganization be completed
  5  9 at the second regular school election following the effective
  5 10 date of the reorganization. Current law provides that
  5 11 reorganization plans be commenced at the first regular school
  5 12 election and be completed at the third regular school election.
  5 13    Also relating to school elections, the bill provides that
  5 14 when a school board vacancy occurs, that a person appointed to
  5 15 fill the vacancy shall hold office until a successor is elected
  5 16 and qualified at the next regular school election unless there
  5 17 is an intervening special election. The bill also makes
  5 18 terminology changes related to the timing required for calling
  5 19 and holding a special election when a school board vacancy
  5 20 occurs and a replacement has not been appointed.
