  3  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  3 11    This bill creates a home modification tax credit available
  3 12 against the individual income tax for the first $2,500 of
  3 13 unreimbursed home modification expenses paid or incurred by
  3 14 an eligible individual during the tax year in connection with
  3 15 residential property located in Iowa that is the primary
  3 16 residence of the eligible individual or a dependent of the
  3 17 eligible individual.
  3 18    An individual is an "eligible individual" if the individual
  3 19 does not have net income (including his or her spouse's net
  3 20 income) in excess of 250 percent of the U.S. poverty level,
  3 21 and if the individual meets one of the other conditions
  3 22 specified in the bill.  The individual must be disabled or have
  3 23 a dependent who is disabled, or the individual or dependent of
  3 24 the individual must have a chronic condition that will require

  3 33    The tax credit is refundable.  To the extent the home
  3 34 modification expenses are otherwise deductible under Iowa law
  3 35 for state income tax purposes, the bill allows the expenses to
  4  1 be deducted and claimed under the home modification tax credit.
  4  2    The bill defines "home modification expenses" as expenses
  4  3 incurred in the permanent modification or permanent technology
  4  4 enhancement of a home that permits the resident to remain in
  4  5 the home, but requires the department of revenue (department)
  4  6 to adopt rules establishing allowable home modification
  4  7 expenses and criteria for determining what constitutes home
  4  8 modification expenses.  In adopting rules, the department is
  4  9 required to consult with the prevention of disabilities policy
  4 10 council (council), and the council is required to consult with
  4 11 various stakeholders.
  4 12    The bill applies retroactively to tax years beginning on or
  4 13 after January 1, 2015.  The bill applies to home modification
  4 14 expenses paid or incurred on or after July 1, 2015.
