 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.

 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares

 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,
 26 20 a "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 10    1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
 23 11 a perpetual care cemetery may apply to the commissioner to
 23 12 withdraw funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial
 23 13 emergency.  The commissioner shall, by rule, establish
 23 14 standards and procedures for such applications and for
 23 15 withdrawals from care funds.
 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a

 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 11 a perpetual care cemetery may apply to the commissioner to
 23 12 withdraw funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial
 23 13 emergency.  The commissioner shall, by rule, establish
 23 14 standards and procedures for such applications and for
 23 15 withdrawals from care funds.
 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,
 26 20 a "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 12 withdraw funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial
 23 13 emergency.  The commissioner shall, by rule, establish
 23 14 standards and procedures for such applications and for
 23 15 withdrawals from care funds.
 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:
 23 26    1.  The section of this Act adding section 502.202,

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares

 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86

 23 13 emergency.  The commissioner shall, by rule, establish
 23 14 standards and procedures for such applications and for
 23 15 withdrawals from care funds.
 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:
 23 26    1.  The section of this Act adding section 502.202,

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.

 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,
 26 20 a "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 15 withdrawals from care funds.
 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:

 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.

 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans

 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or

 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval

 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 16    2.  Upon application, the commissioner may allow a perpetual
 23 17 care cemetery to withdraw funds from the care fund if the
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:
 23 26    1.  The section of this Act adding section 502.202,

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,
 26 20 a "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).

 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or

 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 18 commissioner finds that the cemetery has an urgent financial
 23 19 need and the withdrawal is deemed reasonable and prudent to
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.
 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:
 23 26    1.  The section of this Act adding section 502.202,
 23 27 subsection 24.
 23 28    Sec. 48.  DIRECTIONS TO CODE EDITOR.  The Iowa code editor is
 23 29 directed to transfer section 515.11 to new section 515.23.
 23 30    Sec. 49.  REPEAL.  Section 523A.504, Code 2015, is repealed.
 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,
 26 20 a "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 24    Sec. 47.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provision or
 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:
 23 26    1.  The section of this Act adding section 502.202,

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic
 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating

 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 20 fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The commissioner
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.

 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).

 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or

 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86
       av/nh
 23 21 shall establish conditions for the specific use of the funds
 23 22 withdrawn and may require repayment of all or part of the
 23 23 amount withdrawn.

 23 25 provisions of this Act take effect January 1, 2016:

 23 31                           EXPLANATION
 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a

 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.
       LSB 1287HV (2) 86

 24  1 includes effective date provisions.

 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee

 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined

 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section

 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating

 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.

 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or

 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).

 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.

 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.

 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in

 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating

 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a

 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section

 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares

 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for
 26 19 purposes of investments made by a non=life insurance company,

 26 21 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section
 26 23 521A.5(4)(d) is amended to require that when a domestic

 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a
 27 28 certified public accountant, new Code section 523A.401(10)
 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating
 28  3 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty
 28  4 against a preneed seller for violations of the annual reporting
 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a
 28  7 requirement that the commissioner accept annual reports of
 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken

 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans

 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)

 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating

 28  5 requirement.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for

 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of

 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).

 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.

 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to

 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such

 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such

 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply
 26 12 to all long=term care insurance policies.
 26 13    INSURANCE OTHER THAN LIFE.  The Code editor is directed to
 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.
 26 18    Code section 515.35(4)(m) is amended to provide that for

 26 22    INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS.  Code section

 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a

 27 29 concerning information maintained about purchase agreements
 27 30 funded by insurance proceeds, Code section 523A.502A(2)
 27 31 concerning licensure of sales agents, and Code section
 27 32 523A.803(1)(c) concerning investigations into violations of the
 27 33 Code chapter. Code section 22.7, subsection 58, is amended to
 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.
 28  2    Code section 523A.204(4) and (5) are stricken, eliminating

 28  5 requirement.
 28  6    Code section 523A.205(2) is stricken, eliminating a

 28  8 preneed sellers in electronic format, including computer
 28  9 diskettes.
 28 10    Code section 523A.401(8) is amended by eliminating the
 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 23 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 34    This bill relates to various matters involving insurance
 23 35 and the insurance division of the department of commerce and
 24  1 includes effective date provisions.
 24  2    UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT.  Code section 502.103 is amended
 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified
 25  6 further restrictions on investments of a life insurance
 25  7 company or association in securities apply to mezzanine real
 25  8 estate loans.  Code section 511.8(8)(b) is amended to provide
 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.
 25 33    Code section 511.8(18)(a) is amended to provide that life
 25 34 insurance companies and associations can invest in certain
 25 35 specified equity interests as well as common stocks and shares
 26  1 issued by corporations or institutions.  The provision provides
 26  2 limitations on the percentage of legal reserve that can be
 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an
 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related
 26 11 to prompt payment of claims and the payment of interest apply

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or
 26 16 to a relative of an officer or relative of a company, to Code
 26 17 section 515.23.

 26 24 insurer is required to establish a committee or committees of
 26 25 directors or other persons appointed by the board, that are
 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval

 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in
 27 26 the course of an examination, new Code section 523A.207(2)
 27 27 concerning records obtained during an audit performed by a

 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the

 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for
 24 13 purchase only by Iowa residents and by business organizations
 24 14 located in Iowa and organized and registered under Iowa law.
 24 15 This provision takes effect January 1, 2016.
 24 16    Code section 502.302(1)(a)(1) and (2), concerning specified
 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer
 24 30 or investment adviser.
 24 31    LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ASSOCIATIONS.  Code section
 24 32 511.8(5)(a) and (b) are amended to provide that investments
 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of
 24 35 acquisition, the obligations are investment grade as defined
 25  1 by the commissioner by rule.  Similar changes are made as to
 25  2 investments in preferred and guaranteed stocks (Code section
 25  3 511.8(6)(a)(1)(b)), and financial instruments used in hedging
 25  4 transactions (Code section 511.8(22)(c),(d), and (e)(1)).
 25  5    Code section 511.8(8) is amended to provide that specified

 25  9 that investments of a life insurance company or association
 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life
 25 30 insurance companies and associations can invest in loans
 25 31 secured by collateral consisting of qualified assets or
 25 32 investments instead of securities.

 26  8 innovation fund as defined in Code section 15E.52.
 26  9    LONG=TERM CARE INSURANCE.  Code section 514G.102 is amended
 26 10 to provide that the requirements of Code chapter 514G related

 26 14 transfer Code section 515.11, pertaining to prohibited loans to
 26 15 an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of a company or

 26 17 section 515.23.

 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made
 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 27 34 specify that information provided to the commissioner pursuant
 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide

 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating
 29  9 provisions related to levying an administrative penalty against
 29 10 a preneed sales agent for violations of the annual reporting
 29 11 requirement.
 29 12    Code section 523A.504 requiring a preneed seller to file a
 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.
 29 16    CEMETERIES.  Code section 523I.810(9) is amended to provide
 29 17 that a cemetery may adopt a resolution to authorize the
 29 18 withdrawal and expenditure of the principal of a cemetery
 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24  3 to update references in Code chapter 502 to include current
 24  4 federal statutes. New Code section 502.202(24) provides an
 24  5 exemption from certain securities registration and filing
 24  6 requirements for offers and sales of securities known as
 24  7 intrastate crowdfunding and provides limitations and conditions
 24  8 on such offers and sales of securities in the state.  All
 24  9 offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the exemption
 24 10 must be made through a broker=dealer's internet site.
 24 11 "Intrastate crowdfunding" is defined as the offer or sale of a
 24 12 security by an issuer in a transaction that is available for

 24 17 federal covered securities, are amended to eliminate an option
 24 18 that allows filing fees accompanying notice filings of offers
 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee
 24 21 of $400.  Code section 502.302(1)(a)(2)(a) and (b) are stricken
 24 22 to eliminate the need to file a sales report.  Code section
 24 23 502.302(2) is amended to establish a flat fee of $400 for
 24 24 renewals of such filings.
 24 25    Code section 502.412(9) is amended to provide that the
 24 26 administrator of the securities and regulated industries bureau
 24 27 of the insurance division of the department of commerce has two
 24 28 years instead of one year after acquiring material facts to
 24 29 institute a disciplinary proceeding concerning a broker=dealer

 24 33 in certain corporate obligations made by life insurance
 24 34 companies and associations are allowed if, at the date of

 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.
 25 12    Code section 511.8(8)(b)(1) and (2) are amended to provide
 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,
 25 17 5 percent of the legal reserve for any one public utility
 25 18 company, and 50 percent of the legal reserve for corporate
 25 19 obligations issued by public utility companies.
 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 26  3 invested in specified types of common stocks, shares, or equity
 26  4 interests.
 26  5    Code section 511.8(20)(b) is amended to provide that for
 26  6 purposes of investments made by a life insurance company a
 26  7 "venture capital fund" includes an equity interest in an

 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner
 27 15 by preneed sellers is confidential pursuant to the Iowa
 27 16 open records law (Code chapter 22) and shall not be made

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the

 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is
 29 15 amended to remove a cross=reference to the repealed section.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 26 responsible for nominating candidates for director, evaluating
 26 27 the performance of officers, and recommending the selection
 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such
 26 29 committee members shall not be officers or employers of any
 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 17 available for inspection or copying except upon the approval
 27 18 of the commissioner or the attorney general or when sought
 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)
 27 24 concerning annual reports by financial institutions, Code
 27 25 section 523A.206(6) concerning information obtained in

 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and
 28  1 523A.803 is confidential.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 13 notice and pay a fee to appoint a person to act as a sales agent
 29 14 of the preneed seller is repealed.  Code section 523A.807(3) is

 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 24 19 of such securities to be based on a definite or indefinite
 24 20 amount, instead requiring all notice filers to pay a fixed fee

 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,

 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate
 25 22 loans subject to specified conditions.  The provision specifies
 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn

 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn

 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a

 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate

 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan

 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as

 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 10 in securities of a corporation shall not exceed specified
 25 11 percentages of the legal reserve.

 25 13 that investments in corporate obligations, preferred and
 25 14 guaranteed stocks, equipment trust obligations, or mezzanine
 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve
 25 16 for any one corporation other than a public utility company,

 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 15 real estate loans are limited to 2 percent of legal reserve

 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied

 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 20    New Code section 511.8(9)(h) provides that a life insurance
 25 21 company or association may invest in mezzanine real estate

 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 19 by the preneed seller to whom the records relate.  Such
 27 20 information is also privileged and confidential in any judicial
 27 21 or administrative proceeding except as specified.  Similar
 27 22 requirements concerning confidentiality of information provided
 27 23 to the commissioner are added in Code section 523A.205(3)

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales
 29  5 agent must file an annual report whether or not the sales agent
 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
 29  8 Code section 523A.502A(3) and (4) are stricken, eliminating

 29 19 care fund to repair boundaries; to construct a columbarium,
 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such

 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 23 what terms a mezzanine loan agreement must include and limits
 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied

 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 25 24 the value of a life insurance company's or association's total
 25 25 investments in mezzanine real estate loans.  For purposes of
 25 26 the new provision, "mezzanine real estate loan" means a loan
 25 27 secured by a pledge of a direct or indirect equity interest in
 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that

 25 28 an entity that owns real estate.
 25 29    Code section 511.8(13) is amended to provide that life

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.

 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26  4 interests.

 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific

 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.

 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the

 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a

 26 28 and compensation of principal officers, the majority of such

 26 30 entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
 26 31 the insurer.
 26 32    CEMETERY AND FUNERAL MERCHANDISE AND FUNERAL SERVICES.  Code
 26 33 section 523A.102(8) is stricken, eliminating the definition of
 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 27 35 to Code sections 523A.205, 523A.206, 523A.207, 523A.401, and

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by
 28 20 rule, to establish the terms and conditions under which a
 28 21 seller may file a surety bond.
 28 22    Code section 523A.501(2) is amended to provide that the
 28 23 commissioner may establish the format for applications for a
 28 24 preneed seller's license.  The application is also required to
 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each
 28 35 year so long as the preneed seller has filed a complete annual
 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 20 mausoleum, or similar structure to create additional interment
 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 25 include the name of the natural person or legal entity to be
 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will

 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied

 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the

 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the

 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that
 27 14 information in annual reports provided to the commissioner

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with
 28 12 annual reports filed by insurance companies issuing policies
 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of
 28 19 trust requirements and instead allows the commissioner, by

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied

 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual

 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 26 34 "credit sale".
 26 35    New Code section 523A.102(13A) provides that for purposes
 27  1 of Code chapter 523A, "guaranteed" means that a preneed seller
 27  2 has agreed to accept the funds available from contractual
 27  3 payments made by a purchaser and the allocable portion of
 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price

 28 11 provision that allows computer printouts to be submitted with

 28 13 to fund preneed purchase agreements.  Code section 523A.402(8)
 28 14 is similarly amended to eliminate the provision that such
 28 15 printouts may be submitted with annual reports pertaining to
 28 16 purchase agreements funded by annuity proceeds.
 28 17    Code section 523A.405 is amended to eliminate specific
 28 18 requirements concerning the use of a surety bond in lieu of

 28 26 licensed and any other name under which the preneed seller will
 28 27 be transacting business.  The application must be updated as
 28 28 necessary to ensure that the commissioner is notified of all
 28 29 names under which the preneed seller is operating and doing
 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a
 28 33 preneed seller's license be renewed annually instead of every
 28 34 four years.  The license shall be renewed April 15 of each

 29  1 report and paid the required fees.  Code section 523A.502(5)
 29  2 is similarly amended to require annual renewal of the licenses
 29  3 of preneed sales agents.
 29  4    Code section 523A.502A(1) is amended to provide that a sales

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that
 29 30 distributions from the care fund can be used for the new
 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn

 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and
 27  7 services. A purchaser, beneficiary, or beneficiary's estate
 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw

 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied

 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected

 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that

 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.

 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 29 31 purposes described in Code section 523I.810(9).
 29 32    New Code section 523I.811A provides that a perpetual care
 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 28 30 business. The application must be accompanied by a filing fee
 28 31 set by rule. The current filing fee is $50.
 28 32    Code section 523A.501(7) is amended to require that a

 29 21 spaces; and to purchase equipment for tree, shrub, and lawn
 29 22 care; or to purchase backhoes or similar equipment used to open
 29 23 and close interment spaces.  The bill eliminates a requirement
 29 24 that the repayment schedule provide for interest on the amount
 29 25 withdrawn from the care fund but if the deposit of care fund
 29 26 income over five years is unlikely to fund replenishment of the
 29 27 principal of the care fund, the resolution must be accompanied
 29 28 by a bond or proof of insurance.
 29 29    Code section 523I.811(1) is amended to provide that

 29 33 cemetery may make application to the commissioner to withdraw
 29 34 funds from the cemetery's care fund for a financial emergency.
 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable
 30  2 and prudent to fund a necessary expense of the cemetery.  The
 30  3 commissioner shall establish conditions for the specific use
 30  4 of the funds and may require repayment of all or part of the
 30  5 amount withdrawn.

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the
 27 10 additional costs exceed the funds available. This provision
 27 11 does not prevent the inclusion of nonguaranteed items in an
 27 12 otherwise guaranteed purchase agreement.
 27 13    Code section 523A.204(3) is amended to provide that

 29 35 The commissioner may allow such a withdrawal upon finding that
 30  1 the cemetery has an urgent financial need and it is reasonable

 27  4 accumulated income on those payments as payment in full for the
 27  5 applicable items of cemetery merchandise and services selected
 27  6 and identified in a purchase agreement for the merchandise and

 27  8 is not obligated to pay any additional costs related to price
 27  9 increases on the merchandise and services selected even if the

 29  3 of preneed sales agents.

 29  6 made any sales during the year, is no longer an agent of a
 29  7 preneed seller, or is no longer licensed as a sales agent.
