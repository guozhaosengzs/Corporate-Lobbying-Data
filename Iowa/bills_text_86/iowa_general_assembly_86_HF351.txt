 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on
 13 17 special fuel for diesel engines and aircraft and creating the
 13 18 distribution percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel and
 13 19 special fuel for diesel engines takes effect July 1, 2015, and
 13 20 the sections of the bill limiting the term of indebtedness for
 13 21 certain county projects and the section of the bill relating
 13 22 to extending the access Iowa highway plan take effect upon

 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date

 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11

 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel

 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".

 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on
 13 17 special fuel for diesel engines and aircraft and creating the
 13 18 distribution percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel and
 13 19 special fuel for diesel engines takes effect July 1, 2015, and
 13 20 the sections of the bill limiting the term of indebtedness for
 13 21 certain county projects and the section of the bill relating

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".

 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.

 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the

 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".

 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".

 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.

 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11

 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The

 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall

 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge

 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund

 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.

 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.

 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service

 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the

 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the

 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and

 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in

 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on
 13 17 special fuel for diesel engines and aircraft and creating the
 13 18 distribution percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel and
 13 19 special fuel for diesel engines takes effect July 1, 2015, and

 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,

 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution

 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the

 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,

 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).

 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the

 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides

 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds

 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also

 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.

 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.

 10 18                           EXPLANATION
 10 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 21    This bill relates to transportation funding by limiting the
 10 22 term of indebtedness for certain county projects, modifying
 10 23 certain permit fees, modifying the rate of the excise taxes
 10 24 on motor fuel and certain special fuel, establishing a fuel
 10 25 distribution percentage formula for certain special fuel used
 10 26 in motor vehicles, requiring legislative review of the fuel
 10 27 distribution percentage formulas, and extending the repeal date
 10 28 of the access Iowa highway plan.
 10 29    The bill provides for limitations on the use by counties of
 10 30 moneys allocated from the road use tax fund, including moneys
 10 31 from the secondary road fund, the farm=to=market road fund, the
 10 32 county bridge construction fund, and the RISE fund. The bill
 10 33 provides that such moneys shall not be used for debt service
 10 34 or to otherwise pay principal and interest on bonds, loans, or
 10 35 other indebtedness issued or incurred on or after the effective
 11  1 date of this section of the bill, including refunding,
 11  2 reissuance, or other refinancing of such indebtedness, or
 11  3 refunding, reissuance, or other refinancing of indebtedness
 11  4 issued or incurred prior to the effective date of this section
 11  5 of the bill, if the term for repayment of the indebtedness as
 11  6 financed or refinanced would exceed the useful life of the
 11  7 asset being constructed, reconstructed, improved, repaired,
 11  8 equipped, or maintained.
 11  9    Beginning January 1, 2016, the bill provides for increases
 11 10 in fees for single=trip permits, all=systems permits, and
 11 11 certain permits relating to length, height, and gross weight of
 11 12 vehicles of excessive size and weight (Code chapter 321E).
 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
 11 32 that both distribution percentage formulas shall be subject
 11 33 to legislative review at least every six years. The review
 11 34 shall be based upon a report containing the recommendations of
 11 35 a legislative interim committee appointed to conduct a review
 12  1 of the fuel distribution percentage formulas, to be prepared
 12  2 with the assistance of the department of revenue in association
 12  3 with the department of transportation. The report shall
 12  4 include recommendations for changes or revisions to the fuel
 12  5 distribution percentage formulas. The first such report shall
 12  6 be submitted to the general assembly no later than January 1,
 12  7 2020.
 12  8    The 2005 Iowa Acts provide for the designation of certain
 12  9 highways as access Iowa highways, which receive priority
 12 10 funding from certain moneys in the TIME=21 and RISE funds
 12 11 created in Code sections 312A.2 and 315.2. These provisions
 12 12 will be repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2015. The bill
 12 13 extends the date of repeal to July 1, 2025.
 12 14    The bill provides that it is the intent of the general
 12 15 assembly that 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result
 12 16 of the increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain
 12 17 special fuel enacted in the bill and credited to the secondary
 12 18 road fund or the farm=to=market road fund from the road use tax
 12 19 fund shall be used exclusively for critical road and bridge
 12 20 construction projects that significantly extend the life of
 12 21 such assets. In addition, the bill provides that it is also
 12 22 the intent of the general assembly that the state department of
 12 23 transportation and the state transportation commission shall
 12 24 utilize 100 percent of the revenue produced as a result of the
 12 25 increase in the excise taxes on motor fuel and certain special
 12 26 fuel enacted in the bill that is allocated to the department on
 12 27 critical road and bridge construction projects. The department
 12 28 shall identify the critical road and bridge construction
 12 29 projects funded with such revenue in the department's annual
 12 30 five=year transportation improvement program report.
 12 31    The bill further provides that the department of
 12 32 transportation shall identify $10 million in efficiencies for
 12 33 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and $10 million in
 12 34 efficiencies for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2016. The
 12 35 department shall provide details of activities undertaken to
 13  1 implement these efficiencies in the annual "road use tax fund
 13  2 efficiency report".
 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following
 13 14 the month of enactment except as follows: the section of the
 13 15 bill modifying certain permit fees takes effect January 1,
 13 16 2016, the section of the bill modifying the excise taxes on

 13  3    Pursuant to current law, when the rate of excise tax on motor
 13  4 fuel, ethanol blended gasoline, undyed special fuel, compressed
 13  5 natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas
 13  6 is increased by more than one=half cent per gallon, a person
 13  7 who has title to such fuel held in storage for eventual sale is
 13  8 subject to an inventory tax based on the gallonage in storage
 13  9 at the close of the business day preceding the effective date
 13 10 of the increase. The bill provides that the inventory tax
 13 11 shall not be imposed as a result of the tax increases provided
 13 12 in the bill.
 13 13    The bill takes effect the first day of the month following

 11 13    The bill increases by 10 cents the rate of the excise tax on
 11 14 motor fuel, special fuel for diesel engines, compressed natural
 11 15 gas, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, and
 11 16 increases by 2 cents the rate of the excise tax on special fuel
 11 17 for aircraft. In addition, the bill establishes a distribution
 11 18 percentage formula for biodiesel blended fuel classified as
 11 19 B=11 or higher and special fuel for diesel engines of motor
 11 20 vehicles other than biodiesel blended fuel classified as B=11
 11 21 or higher. If the distribution percentage is not greater than
 11 22 50 percent, the tax rate for biodiesel blended fuel classified
 11 23 as B=11 or higher is 29.5 cents, 3 cents less than special
 11 24 fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles other than biodiesel
 11 25 blended fuel classified as B=11 or higher. As the distribution
 11 26 percentage increases, the difference in the tax rates on the
 11 27 two types of fuel decreases until the distribution percentage
 11 28 is greater than 95 percent, at which point the tax rate for
 11 29 both types of fuel is 32.5 cents.
 11 30    The bill provides that both fuel distribution percentage
 11 31 formulas will expire on June 30, 2020. The bill also provides
