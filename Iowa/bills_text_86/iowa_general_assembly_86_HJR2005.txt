  1 17 Number of counties.SEC. 30A.  The general assembly shall
  1 18 by September 1, 2021, create by law forty counties in the
  1 19 state of Iowa. For the purposes of creating a county under
  1 20 this section, the general assembly shall consider each county
  1 21 existing on January 1, 2021, to be a single indivisible unit,
  1 22 but  may provide for the combination of contiguous counties
  1 23 existing on that date into a newly created county. If the
  1 24 creation of forty counties fails to become law by September
  1 25 15, 2021, the supreme court shall, prior to December 31,
  1 26 2021, cause the creation of forty counties to comply with the
  1 27 requirements in this section.
  1 28 Review by supreme court.SEC. 30B.  Upon verified
  1 29 application by any qualified elector, the supreme court shall
  1 30 review the creation of counties by the general assembly by
  1 31 law.  Should the supreme court determine that such creation
  1 32 does not comply with the requirements of this constitution,
  1 33 the court shall within ninety days cause the creation to so
  1 34 comply.  The supreme court shall have original jurisdiction
  1 35 of all litigation questioning the creation of counties by the
  2  1 general assembly by law.
  2  2    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing proposed
  2  3 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa is referred
  2  4 to the general assembly to be chosen at the next general
  2  5 election for members of the general assembly, and the secretary
  2  6 of state is directed to cause the proposed amendment to be
  2  7 published for three consecutive months previous to the date of
  2  8 that election as provided by law.
  2  9                           EXPLANATION
  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 13 Constitution of the State of Iowa requiring the creation of 40
  2 14 counties in Iowa in 2021.
  2 15    The amendment requires the general assembly to create 40
  2 16 counties by September 1, 2021. Under the amendment, the
  2 17 general assembly is required to consider each county existing
  2 18 on January 1, 2021, as an indivisible unit, but allows the
  2 19 general assembly to provide for the combination of contiguous
  2 20 counties into a newly created county. If, by September 15,
  2 21 2021, no law has been enacted to create 40 counties, the Iowa
  2 22 supreme court is then required to create 40 counties before
  2 23 December 31, 2021. The amendment provides the supreme court
  2 24 with original jurisdiction over litigation relating to the
  2 25 creation of counties. If the supreme court determines the
  2 26 general assembly's creation of counties to be unconstitutional,
  2 27 the amendment requires the supreme court to cause the creation
  2 28 of counties conforming to constitutional requirements, within
  2 29 90 days following the determination.
  2 30    Under the amendment, the designation of counties takes
  2 31 place in the same year as the apportionment of senator and
  2 32 representative districts following the 2020 federal decennial
  2 33 census.
  2 34    The amendment does not modify the authority of the voters
  2 35 of two or more counties to change their county boundary lines
  3  1 at a general election under article III, section 30 of the
  3  2 Constitution of the State of Iowa. The amendment also does not
  3  3 modify the requirement in the article III, section 37 of the
  3  4 Constitution of the State of Iowa, prohibiting the division of
  3  5 counties in forming federal congressional districts.
  3  6    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  3  7 general assembly for adoption before being submitted to the
  3  8 electorate for ratification.

  2  9                           EXPLANATION
  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 13 Constitution of the State of Iowa requiring the creation of 40
  2 14 counties in Iowa in 2021.
  2 15    The amendment requires the general assembly to create 40
  2 16 counties by September 1, 2021. Under the amendment, the
  2 17 general assembly is required to consider each county existing
  2 18 on January 1, 2021, as an indivisible unit, but allows the
  2 19 general assembly to provide for the combination of contiguous
  2 20 counties into a newly created county. If, by September 15,
  2 21 2021, no law has been enacted to create 40 counties, the Iowa
  2 22 supreme court is then required to create 40 counties before
  2 23 December 31, 2021. The amendment provides the supreme court
  2 24 with original jurisdiction over litigation relating to the
  2 25 creation of counties. If the supreme court determines the
  2 26 general assembly's creation of counties to be unconstitutional,
  2 27 the amendment requires the supreme court to cause the creation
  2 28 of counties conforming to constitutional requirements, within
  2 29 90 days following the determination.
  2 30    Under the amendment, the designation of counties takes
  2 31 place in the same year as the apportionment of senator and
  2 32 representative districts following the 2020 federal decennial
  2 33 census.
  2 34    The amendment does not modify the authority of the voters
  2 35 of two or more counties to change their county boundary lines
  3  1 at a general election under article III, section 30 of the
  3  2 Constitution of the State of Iowa. The amendment also does not
  3  3 modify the requirement in the article III, section 37 of the
  3  4 Constitution of the State of Iowa, prohibiting the division of
  3  5 counties in forming federal congressional districts.
  3  6    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  3  7 general assembly for adoption before being submitted to the
  3  8 electorate for ratification.

  1 24 creation of forty counties fails to become law by September
  1 25 15, 2021, the supreme court shall, prior to December 31,

  1 32 does not comply with the requirements of this constitution,

  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 13 Constitution of the State of Iowa requiring the creation of 40
  2 14 counties in Iowa in 2021.
  2 15    The amendment requires the general assembly to create 40
  2 16 counties by September 1, 2021. Under the amendment, the
  2 17 general assembly is required to consider each county existing
  2 18 on January 1, 2021, as an indivisible unit, but allows the
  2 19 general assembly to provide for the combination of contiguous
  2 20 counties into a newly created county. If, by September 15,
  2 21 2021, no law has been enacted to create 40 counties, the Iowa
  2 22 supreme court is then required to create 40 counties before
  2 23 December 31, 2021. The amendment provides the supreme court
  2 24 with original jurisdiction over litigation relating to the
  2 25 creation of counties. If the supreme court determines the
  2 26 general assembly's creation of counties to be unconstitutional,
  2 27 the amendment requires the supreme court to cause the creation
  2 28 of counties conforming to constitutional requirements, within
  2 29 90 days following the determination.
  2 30    Under the amendment, the designation of counties takes
  2 31 place in the same year as the apportionment of senator and
  2 32 representative districts following the 2020 federal decennial
  2 33 census.
  2 34    The amendment does not modify the authority of the voters
  2 35 of two or more counties to change their county boundary lines
  3  1 at a general election under article III, section 30 of the
  3  2 Constitution of the State of Iowa. The amendment also does not

  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 13 Constitution of the State of Iowa requiring the creation of 40
  2 14 counties in Iowa in 2021.
  2 15    The amendment requires the general assembly to create 40
  2 16 counties by September 1, 2021. Under the amendment, the
  2 17 general assembly is required to consider each county existing
  2 18 on January 1, 2021, as an indivisible unit, but allows the
  2 19 general assembly to provide for the combination of contiguous
  2 20 counties into a newly created county. If, by September 15,
  2 21 2021, no law has been enacted to create 40 counties, the Iowa
  2 22 supreme court is then required to create 40 counties before
  2 23 December 31, 2021. The amendment provides the supreme court
  2 24 with original jurisdiction over litigation relating to the
  2 25 creation of counties. If the supreme court determines the
  2 26 general assembly's creation of counties to be unconstitutional,
  2 27 the amendment requires the supreme court to cause the creation
  2 28 of counties conforming to constitutional requirements, within
  2 29 90 days following the determination.
  2 30    Under the amendment, the designation of counties takes
  2 31 place in the same year as the apportionment of senator and
  2 32 representative districts following the 2020 federal decennial
  2 33 census.
  2 34    The amendment does not modify the authority of the voters
  2 35 of two or more counties to change their county boundary lines
  3  1 at a general election under article III, section 30 of the
  3  2 Constitution of the State of Iowa. The amendment also does not
  3  3 modify the requirement in the article III, section 37 of the
  3  4 Constitution of the State of Iowa, prohibiting the division of
  3  5 counties in forming federal congressional districts.
  3  6    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  3  7 general assembly for adoption before being submitted to the
