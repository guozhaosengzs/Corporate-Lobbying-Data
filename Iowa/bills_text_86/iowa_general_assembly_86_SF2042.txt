  3  8 transit services accessible to the general public and receiving
  3  9 federal, state, or local tax support.

  3 22 private nonprofit organizations in the administration of a

  2 28 initiative in the department of transportation to provide

  2 31    The bill defines "employment and education transportation"
  2 32 as an urban or rural program or service that provides an
  2 33 individual with transportation solely to or from a workplace or
  2 34 adult education venue, including but not limited to community
  2 35 college, evening or weekend class, apprenticeship program, or

  3  2 includes but is not limited to expanding or sustaining existing
  3  3 transportation services or service hours; coordinating ride
  3  4 share services, including car pool or van pool services; and
  3  5 shuttle services.

  3  8 transit services accessible to the general public and receiving
  3  9 federal, state, or local tax support.
  3 10    The department shall award funds from the initiative on a

  3 21 with other local, state, or federal governmental agencies and
  3 22 private nonprofit organizations in the administration of a
  3 23 program or service receiving a grant under the initiative and

  2 32 as an urban or rural program or service that provides an
  2 33 individual with transportation solely to or from a workplace or

  3  8 transit services accessible to the general public and receiving
  3  9 federal, state, or local tax support.
  3 10    The department shall award funds from the initiative on a

  3 19 expenditures or construction.
  3 20    The bill permits a public transit system to coordinate
  3 21 with other local, state, or federal governmental agencies and
  3 22 private nonprofit organizations in the administration of a
  3 23 program or service receiving a grant under the initiative and
  3 24 in expenditure of grant funds awarded.

  3 33    The bill requires the department to adopt administrative
  3 34 rules to administer the initiative, including but not limited
  3 35 to an application process and grant award criteria.
