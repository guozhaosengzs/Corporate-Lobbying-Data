  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 honey.
  1  3    1.  As used in this section, "honey" means the substance
  1  4 capable of use as human food that is produced by bees of
  1  5 the genus apis mellifica, and derived from the nectar of
  1  6 plants, secretions of living parts of plants, or excretions of
  1  7 plant=sucking insects on the living parts of plants, that the
  1  8 bees collect, transform, deposit, dehydrate, store, and leave
  1  9 in a honeycomb to ripen and mature.
  1 10    2.  The department shall adopt rules prescribing a label
  1 11 that must be affixed to a container of honey when the honey
  1 12 is packaged in this state and sold or offered for sale to
  1 13 consumers on a retail basis, to the extent such rules are
  1 14 allowed under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21
  1 15 U.S.C. ch. 9, subch. IV, including applicable regulations
  1 16 adopted by the United States food and drug administration.
  1 17    3.  The department shall adopt rules that prescribe the size
  1 18 of the label, where the label may be affixed to the container,
  1 19 and the size and type of letters printed on the label.  The

  1 21    a.  The name and address of the person packaging the honey.
  1 22    b.  The net weight of the honey.
  1 23    c.  The grade assigned to the honey and the color for the

  1 27    4.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the department
  1 28 from adopting rules that allow a person to supplement the
  1 29 information required to be contained on the label, including
  1 30 but not limited to a further description of the quality or
  1 31 type of honey being sold or offered for sale.  The label may
  1 32 identify a predominant flavor of the honey or the principal
  1 33 source from which the honey is derived so long as it is clearly
  1 34 predominant and readily distinguishable.
  1 35    Sec. 2.  RULEMAKING.  In adopting rules under this Act, the
  2  1 department of agriculture and land stewardship shall consult
  2  2 with interested persons including but not limited to the Iowa

  2  8 authorizes the department of agriculture and land stewardship
  2  9 to regulate food sold or offered for sale, including by
  2 10 requiring that labels be affixed to food containers.  The
  2 11 bill requires the department to adopt rules prescribing a
  2 12 label that must be affixed to a container of honey when the

  2 23 contained on the label.  In adopting the rules, the department
  2 24 must consult with interested persons.
  2 25    ENFORCEMENT.  The department may restrain a person violating
