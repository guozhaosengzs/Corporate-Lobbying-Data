  3 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 34    This bill provides that an eligible employee is entitled to
  3 35 take employment leave to attend a parent=teacher conference.
  4  1 "Leave" is defined as full or partial absence from an eligible
  4  2 employee's ordinary job responsibilities either with full or
  4  3 partial pay or without pay.  An "eligible employee" is defined
  4  4 as an employee as defined in Code section 91A.2 who has been
  4  5 employed for at least 12 months and for least 1,250 hours of
  4  6 service during the previous 12=month period by the employer
  4  7 from whom leave is requested.  An "employer" is defined as a
  4  8 person who, in this state, employs 50 or more natural persons
  4  9 for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar work
  4 10 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.
  4 11    The bill provides that an employer may deny the leave
  4 12 to an eligible employee if denial is necessary to prevent
  4 13 substantial economic injury to the operations of the employer;
  4 14 the employer notifies the employee of the employer's intent to
  4 15 deny restoration of the employee's position on such basis at
  4 16 the time the employer determines that such injury would occur;
  4 17 and in any case in which the leave has commenced, the employee
  4 18 elects not to return to employment after receiving such notice.
  4 19 This exemption applies only to an eligible employee who is a
  4 20 salaried employee and who is among the highest paid 10 percent
  4 21 of the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of
  4 22 the facility at which the employee is employed.
  4 23    The bill provides that the leave need not be paid leave.
  4 24 However, an eligible employee may elect to substitute for the
  4 25 leave any of the eligible employee's accrued vacation leave or
  4 26 other accrued time off during such period or any other paid or
  4 27 unpaid time off negotiated with the employer.
  4 28    The bill requires an eligible employee to provide the
  4 29 employer with reasonable advance notice of foreseeable need for
  4 30 the leave.  Reasonable notice shall be at least 30 days where
  4 31 practical.  An eligible employee is also required to make a
  4 32 reasonable effort in the scheduling of the leave so as not to
  4 33 unduly disrupt the operations of an employer.
  4 34    The bill provides that an employer may require that a request
  4 35 for leave be supported by a certification issued by a school
  5  1 superintendent, principal, or other school authority of the
  5  2 eligible employee's child.  The eligible employee must then
  5  3 provide, in a timely manner, certification to the employer.
  5  4 The certification is to include the date on which the leave is
  5  5 to occur.
  5  6    The bill requires each employer to post a notice, to be

  5  8 excerpts from, or summaries of, the pertinent provisions of the
  5  9 bill.
  5 10    The bill applies to only those collective bargaining

  4 11    The bill provides that an employer may deny the leave
  4 12 to an eligible employee if denial is necessary to prevent
  4 13 substantial economic injury to the operations of the employer;
  4 14 the employer notifies the employee of the employer's intent to

  4 16 the time the employer determines that such injury would occur;
  4 17 and in any case in which the leave has commenced, the employee
  4 18 elects not to return to employment after receiving such notice.
  4 19 This exemption applies only to an eligible employee who is a
  4 20 salaried employee and who is among the highest paid 10 percent
  4 21 of the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of
  4 22 the facility at which the employee is employed.

  4 28    The bill requires an eligible employee to provide the

  4 30 the leave.  Reasonable notice shall be at least 30 days where
  4 31 practical.  An eligible employee is also required to make a
  4 32 reasonable effort in the scheduling of the leave so as not to
  4 33 unduly disrupt the operations of an employer.
  4 34    The bill provides that an employer may require that a request
  4 35 for leave be supported by a certification issued by a school
  5  1 superintendent, principal, or other school authority of the
  5  2 eligible employee's child.  The eligible employee must then
  5  3 provide, in a timely manner, certification to the employer.
  5  4 The certification is to include the date on which the leave is
  5  5 to occur.
  5  6    The bill requires each employer to post a notice, to be
