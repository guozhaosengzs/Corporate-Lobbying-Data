  3 29                           EXPLANATION
  3 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 32    This bill provides for the issuance of special vehicle
  3 33 registration plates containing a space for the placement of
  3 34 an organization decal and provides a process for the approval
  3 35 of  registration plate decals to be issued by qualifying
  4  1 organizations.
  4  2    Under current law, anyone may submit a request to the
  4  3 department of transportation for approval of a new special
  4  4 registration plate with a processed emblem.  If the department
  4  5 approves the request and the design of the proposed emblem,
  4  6 a minimum of 500 paid applications are required before the
  4  7 department begins issuing the plate.  The department may cancel
  4  8 its approval if sufficient applications are not received within
  4  9 one year.  A vehicle owner is charged a fee of $25 for the
  4 10 issuance of the special plates, and an annual $5 validation
  4 11 fee for renewal.  Those fees are deposited in the road use
  4 12 tax fund.  An alternative process allows for a state agency
  4 13 to sponsor a special registration plate, with fees of $35 for
  4 14 issuance and $10 for renewal.  Those fees are credited to the
  4 15 sponsoring state agency.
  4 16    The bill eliminates the current process for a person to
  4 17 request a new special plate and eliminates state agency
  4 18 sponsorship of new special plates.  Under the bill, the
  4 19 department will begin issuing special registration plates with
  4 20 a space reserved for placement of an organization decal to be
  4 21 designed, produced, and issued by a qualifying organization,
  4 22 rather than the department.  The plates will be available
  4 23 without an additional special plate fee at the time of initial
  4 24 registration of a vehicle, and will be renewed annually upon
  4 25 payment of the regular annual registration fee for the vehicle.
  4 26 A $5 replacement fee applies if the plates are issued in
  4 27 exchange for regular or special plates.  The new plates will
  4 28 also be available as personalized plates upon payment of
  4 29 personalized plate fees.
  4 30    A qualifying organization must be a nonprofit corporation
  4 31 with at least 200 members, whose primary activity or interest
  4 32 serves the community, contributes to the welfare of others, and
  4 33 is not discriminatory.  A group of such organizations with a
  4 34 common purpose may also be approved to issue a decal.  The bill
  4 35 specifies that organizations that promote a specific product
  5  1 or brand name are not eligible to issue organization decals.
  5  2 An organization desiring to issue a decal must apply to the
  5  3 department for approval by submitting information concerning
  5  4 its nonprofit corporation identity along with a copy of the
  5  5 proposed decal design, certification of legal rights to use
  5  6 the design,  and an explanation of the purpose of the decal,
  5  7 eligibility requirements, and fees the organization will charge
  5  8 for the decal.  The department may establish criteria for decal
  5  9 designs, including that a decal shall not promote a specific
  5 10 religion, faith, or anti=religious sentiment, shall not have
  5 11 any sexual connotation, and shall not be vulgar, prejudiced,
  5 12 hostile, insulting, or racially or ethnically degrading.  If
  5 13 the department approves the application, the organization is
  5 14 responsible for the production, administration, and issuance
  5 15 of the decal, and any fees charged by the organization for the
  5 16 decals will be retained by the organization.
  5 17    The bill prohibits any organization from issuing a decal
  5 18 without the approval of the department.  The bill also
  5 19 prohibits a person from displaying a decal other than an
  5 20 approved decal on a vehicle registration plate.  Pursuant to
  5 21 current law, a person who violates Code provisions relating
  5 22 to vehicle registration plates commits a simple misdemeanor
  5 23 punishable by a scheduled fine of $20.

  4 13 to sponsor a special registration plate, with fees of $35 for
  4 14 issuance and $10 for renewal.  Those fees are credited to the
  4 15 sponsoring state agency.
  4 16    The bill eliminates the current process for a person to
  4 17 request a new special plate and eliminates state agency
  4 18 sponsorship of new special plates.  Under the bill, the
  4 19 department will begin issuing special registration plates with
  4 20 a space reserved for placement of an organization decal to be
  4 21 designed, produced, and issued by a qualifying organization,
  4 22 rather than the department.  The plates will be available
  4 23 without an additional special plate fee at the time of initial
  4 24 registration of a vehicle, and will be renewed annually upon
  4 25 payment of the regular annual registration fee for the vehicle.
  4 26 A $5 replacement fee applies if the plates are issued in
  4 27 exchange for regular or special plates.  The new plates will
  4 28 also be available as personalized plates upon payment of
  4 29 personalized plate fees.
  4 30    A qualifying organization must be a nonprofit corporation
  4 31 with at least 200 members, whose primary activity or interest
  4 32 serves the community, contributes to the welfare of others, and
  4 33 is not discriminatory.  A group of such organizations with a
  4 34 common purpose may also be approved to issue a decal.  The bill
  4 35 specifies that organizations that promote a specific product
  5  1 or brand name are not eligible to issue organization decals.
  5  2 An organization desiring to issue a decal must apply to the
  5  3 department for approval by submitting information concerning
  5  4 its nonprofit corporation identity along with a copy of the
  5  5 proposed decal design, certification of legal rights to use
  5  6 the design,  and an explanation of the purpose of the decal,
  5  7 eligibility requirements, and fees the organization will charge
  5  8 for the decal.  The department may establish criteria for decal
  5  9 designs, including that a decal shall not promote a specific
  5 10 religion, faith, or anti=religious sentiment, shall not have
  5 11 any sexual connotation, and shall not be vulgar, prejudiced,
  5 12 hostile, insulting, or racially or ethnically degrading.  If
  5 13 the department approves the application, the organization is
  5 14 responsible for the production, administration, and issuance
  5 15 of the decal, and any fees charged by the organization for the
  5 16 decals will be retained by the organization.
  5 17    The bill prohibits any organization from issuing a decal
  5 18 without the approval of the department.  The bill also
  5 19 prohibits a person from displaying a decal other than an
  5 20 approved decal on a vehicle registration plate.  Pursuant to
  5 21 current law, a person who violates Code provisions relating
  5 22 to vehicle registration plates commits a simple misdemeanor
  5 23 punishable by a scheduled fine of $20.
