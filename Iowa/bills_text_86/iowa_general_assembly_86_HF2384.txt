  9 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 32    This bill relates to the medical cannabidiol Act, makes
  9 33 related modifications, and provides for civil and criminal
  9 34 penalties and fees.
  9 35    MEDICAL CANNABIDIOL ACT == OVERVIEW.  Iowa Code chapter
 10  1 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently allows an Iowa
 10  2 licensed neurologist who has examined and treated a patient
 10  3 suffering from intractable epilepsy to  provide a written
 10  4 recommendation for the patient's medical use of cannabidiol
 10  5 to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable epilepsy if
 10  6 no other satisfactory alternative treatment options exist
 10  7 and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives a
 10  8 written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 10  9 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 10 10 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 10 11 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 10 12 an out=of=state source.  The department of public health
 10 13 is required to maintain a confidential file of the names
 10 14 of each patient and primary caregiver to or for whom the
 10 15 department issues a cannabidiol registration card and to keep
 10 16 such information confidential except as otherwise allowed.
 10 17 The medical cannabidiol Act provides affirmative defenses
 10 18 to a neurologist, a patient, and a primary caregiver from
 10 19 prosecution.  A person who knowingly or intentionally possesses
 10 20 or uses cannabidiol in violation of the medical cannabidiol
 10 21 Act is subject to the penalties provided under Code chapters
 10 22 124 (controlled substances) and 453B (excise taxes on unlawful
 10 23 dealing in certain substances).
 10 24    DEBILITATING MEDICAL CONDITIONS == HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER.
 10 25  The bill amends the medical cannabidiol Act to include multiple
 10 26 sclerosis and terminal cancer, in addition to intractable
 10 27 epilepsy, as additional debilitating medical conditions for
 10 28 which a patient may receive a written recommendation from a
 10 29 health care practitioner for the patient's medical use of
 10 30 cannabidiol. "Health care practitioner" is defined to mean any
 10 31 Iowa licensed physician who provides specialty care for one or
 10 32 more debilitating medical conditions.
 10 33    CANNABIDIOL REGISTRATION CARD FEE.  The bill requires a
 10 34 patient to submit a cannabidiol registration card fee of $100
 10 35 or $25 to the department, depending on whether a patient is the
 11  1 recipient of certain public assistance.
 11  2    CONFIDENTIALITY.  The bill provides that confidential
 11  3 patient and primary caregiver cannabidiol registration card
 11  4 information maintained by the department may be disclosed to
 11  5 authorized employees of a medical cannabidiol manufacturer
 11  6 under certain circumstances.
 11  7    MEDICAL CANNABIDIOL MANUFACTURER == LICENSURE.  The bill
 11  8 requires the department to license by December 1, 2016,
 11  9 two medical cannabidiol manufacturers to manufacture and
 11 10 dispense cannabidiol within this state. As a condition for
 11 11 licensure, a medical cannabidiol manufacturer must agree to
 11 12 begin supplying and dispensing cannabidiol to patients in
 11 13 this state by July 1, 2017. The department is directed to
 11 14 consider several factors in determining whether to license a
 11 15 medical cannabidiol manufacturer. Each medical cannabidiol
 11 16 manufacturer is required to contract with the state hygienic
 11 17 laboratory at the university of Iowa to test the cannabidiol
 11 18 produced by the manufacturer and to report testing results to
 11 19 the medical cannabidiol manufacturer, and is required to pay a
 11 20 nonrefundable application fee of $10,000.
 11 21    MEDICAL CANNABIDIOL MANUFACTURER == ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
 11 22  The bill provides that certain requirements must be included in
 11 23 the operating documents of a medical cannabidiol manufacturer.
 11 24 A medical cannabidiol manufacturer is prohibited from engaging
 11 25 in certain activities and is subject to reasonable inspection
 11 26 and reasonable restrictions by the department.
 11 27    A medical cannabidiol manufacturer is required to provide
 11 28 a reliable and ongoing supply of cannabidiol to treat every
 11 29 debilitating medical condition pursuant to the provisions of
 11 30 the bill and shall manufacture, cultivate, harvest, package,
 11 31 and process cannabidiol in an enclosed, locked facility at
 11 32 a physical address provided to the department during the
 11 33 licensure process.
 11 34    FEES.  Cannabidiol registration card fees and medical
 11 35 cannabidiol manufacturer application and annual fees collected
 12  1 by the department shall be retained by the department, and
 12  2 shall be used for the purpose of regulating medical cannabidiol
 12  3 manufacturers and for other expenses necessary for the
 12  4 administration of the bill.
 12  5    ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENT DUTIES ==== RULES.  The bill requires
 12  6 the department to adopt rules relating to cannabidiol
 12  7 registration cards and medical cannabidiol manufacturer
 12  8 licenses, requirements for the licensure of medical cannabidiol
 12  9 manufacturers, a dispensing system for medical cannabidiol
 12 10 manufacturers to dispense cannabidiol within this state
 12 11 that follows certain requirements, annual fees from medical
 12 12 cannabidiol manufacturers, public safety procedures, and the
 12 13 establishment and implementation of a statewide cannabidiol
 12 14 registry management sale tracking system.
 12 15    USE OF CANNABIDIOL ==== SMOKING AND VAPING PROHIBITED.  The
 12 16 bill provides that a patient, including an out=of=state patient
 12 17 who is in Iowa, shall not consume the cannabidiol by smoking or
 12 18 vaping the cannabidiol.
 12 19    USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIDIOL ==== AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
 12 20  The bill provides prosecution immunity for a health care
 12 21 practitioner and a medical cannabidiol manufacturer
 12 22 including any authorized agents or employees of the health
 12 23 care practitioner or medical cannabidiol manufacturer, for
 12 24 activities undertaken by the health care practitioner or
 12 25 medical cannabidiol manufacturer, pursuant to the provisions
 12 26 of the bill.
 12 27    PENALTIES.  The bill provides that a medical cannabidiol
 12 28 manufacturer shall be assessed a civil penalty of up to $1,000
 12 29 per violation for any violation of the bill in addition to any
 12 30 other applicable penalties.
 12 31    REPEAL.  The bill repeals Code sections 124D.7 (penalties)
 12 32 and 124D.8 (repealing Code chapter 124D on July 1, 2017).
