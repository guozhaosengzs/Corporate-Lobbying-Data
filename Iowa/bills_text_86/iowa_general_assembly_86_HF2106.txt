  1 22 the best interest of the child  1 22 the best interest of the child  1 23                           EXPLANATION
  1 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 26    This bill requires a court to provide for joint custody
  1 27 of the child by the parties. Current law provides that the
  1 28 court may provide for joint custody of the child. However, the
  1 29 bill does not change current law that provides if the court
  1 30 finds that a history of domestic abuse exists, a rebuttable
  1 31 presumption against the awarding of joint custody exists.
  1 32    The bill also provides that, notwithstanding the required
  1 33 awarding of joint custody of a child, upon application
  1 34 of either parent opposing joint custody, the court is to
  1 35 consider factors specified in current law to determine if
  2  1 joint custody is reasonable and in the best interest of the
  2  2 child.  The factors include: whether each parent would be a
  2  3 suitable custodian for the child; whether the psychological
  2  4 and emotional needs and development of the child will suffer
  2  5 due to lack of active contact with and attention from both
  2  6 parents; whether the parents can communicate with each other
  2  7 regarding the child's needs; whether both parents have actively
  2  8 cared for the child before and since the separation; whether
  2  9 each parent can support the other parent's relationship with
  2 10 the child; whether the custody arrangement is in accord with
  2 11 the child's wishes or whether the child has strong opposition,
  2 12 taking into consideration the child's age and maturity; whether
  2 13 one or both the parents agree or are opposed to joint custody;
  2 14 the geographic proximity of the parents; whether the safety
  2 15 of the child, other children, or the other parent will be
  2 16 jeopardized by the awarding of joint custody or by unsupervised
  2 17 or unrestricted visitation; whether a history of domestic abuse
  2 18 exists; and whether a parent has allowed a person custody or
  2 19 control of, or unsupervised access to a child after knowing
  2 20 the person is required to register or is on the sex offender
  2 21 registry as a sex offender.
  2 22    The bill continues current law requiring that if the court
  2 23 does not grant joint custody upon application of a parent
  2 24 opposed to joint custody, the court is required to cite clear
  2 25 and convincing evidence, pursuant to the factors specified,
  2 26 that joint custody is unreasonable and not in the best
  2 27 interest of the child to the extent that the legal custodial
  2 28 relationship between the child and a parent should be severed.
  2 29 The bill also continues current law that a finding by the
  2 30 court that a history of domestic abuse exists, which is not
  2 31 rebutted, shall outweigh consideration of any other factor in
  2 32 the determination of the awarding of custody.
