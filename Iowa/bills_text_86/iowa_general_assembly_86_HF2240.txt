  1 22 other similar material. Where crushed material is used, one
  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage
  1 30 requirements of this subparagraph.
  1 31    (2)  Crushed material smaller than that described in
  1 32 subparagraph (1) shall be used whenever practicable, especially
  1 33 in places where drainage and durability issues do not exist.
  1 34 Material capable of passing through a three=fourths inch square
  1 35 sieve opening or smaller is recommended for switching lead
  2  1 tracks.
  2  2    b.  Walkways shall have a reasonably uniform surface and
  2  3 be maintained in a safe condition without compromising track
  2  4 drainage.
  2  5    c.  Cross slopes for walkways shall not exceed one inch of
  2  6 elevation for each eight inches of horizontal length in any
  2  7 direction.
  2  8    d.  Walkways shall be at least two feet wide.
  2  9    e.  Walkways shall be kept reasonably free of spilled fuel
  2 10 oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast rocks, and other
  2 11 hazards or obstructions.
  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in
  4  7 accordance with chapter 17A.
  4  8    9.  Penalty.  A railroad corporation who violates this
  4  9 section commits a "schedule one" violation punishable
  4 10 under section 327C.5. Each day a violation exists shall be
  4 11 considered a separate violation.
  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the

  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  1  7    2.  Definitions.  As used in this section, unless the context
  1  8 otherwise requires:
  1  9    a.  "Department" means the department of transportation.
  1 10    b.  "Frequently" means at least one shift per day for
  1 11 five days per week, or any other period the department deems
  1 12 frequent enough to warrant an order pursuant to subsection 5.
  1 13    c.  "Good cause" includes but is not limited to a showing
  1 14 that compliance with this section will impose an undue hardship
  1 15 on the railroad corporation.
  1 16    3.  Standard.  A railroad corporation shall provide walkways
  1 17 adjacent to those portions of rail yard tracks where railroad
  1 18 employees frequently perform switching activities.
  1 19    4.  General requirements and recommendations.
  1 20    a.  (1)  Walkways may be surfaced with asphalt, concrete,
  1 21 planking, grating, native material, crushed material, or
  1 22 other similar material. Where crushed material is used, one
  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage
  1 30 requirements of this subparagraph.
  1 31    (2)  Crushed material smaller than that described in
  1 32 subparagraph (1) shall be used whenever practicable, especially
  1 33 in places where drainage and durability issues do not exist.
  1 34 Material capable of passing through a three=fourths inch square
  1 35 sieve opening or smaller is recommended for switching lead
  2  1 tracks.
  2  2    b.  Walkways shall have a reasonably uniform surface and
  2  3 be maintained in a safe condition without compromising track
  2  4 drainage.
  2  5    c.  Cross slopes for walkways shall not exceed one inch of
  2  6 elevation for each eight inches of horizontal length in any
  2  7 direction.
  2  8    d.  Walkways shall be at least two feet wide.
  2  9    e.  Walkways shall be kept reasonably free of spilled fuel
  2 10 oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast rocks, and other
  2 11 hazards or obstructions.
  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation

  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in

  1  8 otherwise requires:
  1  9    a.  "Department" means the department of transportation.
  1 10    b.  "Frequently" means at least one shift per day for
  1 11 five days per week, or any other period the department deems
  1 12 frequent enough to warrant an order pursuant to subsection 5.
  1 13    c.  "Good cause" includes but is not limited to a showing
  1 14 that compliance with this section will impose an undue hardship
  1 15 on the railroad corporation.
  1 16    3.  Standard.  A railroad corporation shall provide walkways
  1 17 adjacent to those portions of rail yard tracks where railroad
  1 18 employees frequently perform switching activities.

  1 22 other similar material. Where crushed material is used, one
  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage
  1 30 requirements of this subparagraph.
  1 31    (2)  Crushed material smaller than that described in
  1 32 subparagraph (1) shall be used whenever practicable, especially
  1 33 in places where drainage and durability issues do not exist.
  1 34 Material capable of passing through a three=fourths inch square
  1 35 sieve opening or smaller is recommended for switching lead
  2  1 tracks.
  2  2    b.  Walkways shall have a reasonably uniform surface and

  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing

  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in
  4  7 accordance with chapter 17A.
  4  8    9.  Penalty.  A railroad corporation who violates this
  4  9 section commits a "schedule one" violation punishable
  4 10 under section 327C.5. Each day a violation exists shall be
  4 11 considered a separate violation.
  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  1 10    b.  "Frequently" means at least one shift per day for
  1 11 five days per week, or any other period the department deems
  1 12 frequent enough to warrant an order pursuant to subsection 5.
  1 13    c.  "Good cause" includes but is not limited to a showing
  1 14 that compliance with this section will impose an undue hardship
  1 15 on the railroad corporation.
  1 16    3.  Standard.  A railroad corporation shall provide walkways
  1 17 adjacent to those portions of rail yard tracks where railroad
  1 18 employees frequently perform switching activities.
  1 19    4.  General requirements and recommendations.
  1 20    a.  (1)  Walkways may be surfaced with asphalt, concrete,
  1 21 planking, grating, native material, crushed material, or
  1 22 other similar material. Where crushed material is used, one
  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage
  1 30 requirements of this subparagraph.
  1 31    (2)  Crushed material smaller than that described in
  1 32 subparagraph (1) shall be used whenever practicable, especially
  1 33 in places where drainage and durability issues do not exist.
  1 34 Material capable of passing through a three=fourths inch square
  1 35 sieve opening or smaller is recommended for switching lead
  2  1 tracks.
  2  2    b.  Walkways shall have a reasonably uniform surface and
  2  3 be maintained in a safe condition without compromising track
  2  4 drainage.
  2  5    c.  Cross slopes for walkways shall not exceed one inch of
  2  6 elevation for each eight inches of horizontal length in any
  2  7 direction.
  2  8    d.  Walkways shall be at least two feet wide.
  2  9    e.  Walkways shall be kept reasonably free of spilled fuel
  2 10 oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast rocks, and other
  2 11 hazards or obstructions.
  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in
  4  7 accordance with chapter 17A.
  4  8    9.  Penalty.  A railroad corporation who violates this
  4  9 section commits a "schedule one" violation punishable
  4 10 under section 327C.5. Each day a violation exists shall be
  4 11 considered a separate violation.

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of

  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the

  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.

  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:

  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No

  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in

  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.

  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  1 15 on the railroad corporation.
  1 16    3.  Standard.  A railroad corporation shall provide walkways
  1 17 adjacent to those portions of rail yard tracks where railroad
  1 18 employees frequently perform switching activities.
  1 19    4.  General requirements and recommendations.
  1 20    a.  (1)  Walkways may be surfaced with asphalt, concrete,
  1 21 planking, grating, native material, crushed material, or
  1 22 other similar material. Where crushed material is used, one
  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage
  1 30 requirements of this subparagraph.
  1 31    (2)  Crushed material smaller than that described in
  1 32 subparagraph (1) shall be used whenever practicable, especially
  1 33 in places where drainage and durability issues do not exist.
  1 34 Material capable of passing through a three=fourths inch square
  1 35 sieve opening or smaller is recommended for switching lead
  2  1 tracks.
  2  2    b.  Walkways shall have a reasonably uniform surface and
  2  3 be maintained in a safe condition without compromising track
  2  4 drainage.
  2  5    c.  Cross slopes for walkways shall not exceed one inch of
  2  6 elevation for each eight inches of horizontal length in any
  2  7 direction.
  2  8    d.  Walkways shall be at least two feet wide.
  2  9    e.  Walkways shall be kept reasonably free of spilled fuel
  2 10 oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast rocks, and other
  2 11 hazards or obstructions.
  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the

  1 23 hundred percent of the material shall be capable of passing
  1 24 through a one and one=half inch square sieve opening, and not
  1 25 less than ninety percent of the material shall be capable of
  1 26 passing through a one=inch square sieve opening. A de minimus
  1 27 variation from these requirements shall not be a violation
  1 28 of this section in instances where the railroad corporation
  1 29 has made a good=faith effort to comply with the percentage

  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.

  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation

  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in
  4  7 accordance with chapter 17A.
  4  8    9.  Penalty.  A railroad corporation who violates this

  4 11 considered a separate violation.
  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the

  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the

  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's

  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.

  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.

  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the

  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after

  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 11 hazards or obstructions.
  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing
  2 22 walkway to conform with subsections 3 and 4 within a reasonable
  2 23 period of time.
  2 24    6.  Compliance.  A railroad corporation is excused from
  2 25 complying with this section under the following circumstances:
  2 26    a.  During maintenance activities.
  2 27    b.  In the event of a derailment.
  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  3  6 by making a written complaint to the railroad corporation. No
  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after

  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 12    5.  Other tracks.  If the department finds, after notice
  2 13 and hearing, that railroad employees who frequently perform
  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:
  2 18    a.  Order a railroad corporation to construct a walkway
  2 19 adjacent to a portion of track where railroad employees
  2 20 frequently perform switching activities.
  2 21    b.  Require a railroad corporation to modify an existing

  2 28    c.  During periods of heavy rain, snow, or similar weather
  2 29 conditions, and for a reasonable time after such conditions
  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation

  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days

  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 14 switching activities adjacent to a portion of track are exposed
  2 15 to safety hazards due to the lack of a walkway or due to the
  2 16 condition of a walkway constructed before July 1, 2015, the
  2 17 department may do one of the following:

  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  2 30 subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 31    d.  In the event of a rock slide, earth slide, washout, or
  2 32 similar seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  2 33 such conditions subside to allow a return to compliance.
  2 34    7.  Waiver.  A railroad corporation may petition the
  2 35 department for a waiver of any provision of this section. The
  3  1 department may grant a waiver of any provision of this section
  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.
  3  3    8.  Enforcement.
  3  4    a.  A person alleging a violation of this section shall
  3  5 attempt to address the allegation with the railroad corporation

  3  7 later than thirty days after receiving the written complaint,
  3  8 the railroad corporation shall respond in writing to the person
  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the
  3 15 person may file a formal complaint with the department.
  3 16    b.  A formal complaint to the department shall contain a
  3 17 copy of the written complaint made to the railroad corporation
  3 18 under paragraph "a", and a copy of the railroad corporation's
  3 19 written response, if any. No later than ten days after
  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,
  3 31 if the department finds that a violation does not exist,
  3 32 the department shall deny the complaint and send written
  3 33 notification to the parties informing them of the denial.
  3 34    c.  A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  3 35 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  4  1 and appeals within ten days of being notified of the
  4  2 department's decision. The department of inspections and
  4  3 appeals shall render a decision on the appeal and notify the
  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in

  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any

  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not

  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  3  2 where the railroad corporation shows good cause.

  3  9 alleging the violation, describing what action, if any, the
  3 10 railroad corporation intends to take to correct the alleged
  3 11 violation. If the railroad corporation does not respond in
  3 12 writing to the person alleging the violation within thirty days
  3 13 of receiving the complaint, or does not correct the alleged
  3 14 violation within ninety days of receiving the complaint, the

  3 20 receiving the formal complaint, the department shall send
  3 21 written notification to the railroad corporation informing it
  3 22 of the complaint and its duties under this paragraph. No later
  3 23 than thirty days after receiving written notification, the
  3 24 railroad corporation shall either correct the alleged violation
  3 25 or contest the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  3 26 the complaint, the department shall inspect the area of the
  3 27 alleged violation. Upon inspection, if the department finds
  3 28 that a violation exists, the department shall issue an order
  3 29 requiring the railroad corporation to correct the violation
  3 30 within thirty days of receipt of the order. Upon inspection,

  4  4 parties of the decision in writing no more than fifteen days
  4  5 after the appeal was filed. Judicial review of the decision
  4  6 of the department of inspections and appeals may be sought in

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the

  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.

  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"
  6  3 violation, punishable by a $100 fine for each day a violation
  6  4 exists.

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
  5 31 that the complaint is denied.
  5 32    A party to the complaint may appeal the department's
  5 33 decision by filing an appeal with the department of inspections
  5 34 and appeals and judicial review of the decision of the
  5 35 department of inspections and appeals may be sought according
  6  1 to the Iowa administrative procedure Act.
  6  2    A violation of the bill's provisions is a "schedule one"

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill establishes standards and requirements for the
  4 16 construction and maintenance of walkways in rail yards. The
  4 17 provisions of the bill apply to all tracks and walkways in rail
  4 18 yards in this state, but do not apply to tracks or walkways
  4 19 in an industry yard owned by an entity other than a railroad
  4 20 corporation.
  4 21    The bill establishes a standard requirement for railroad
  4 22 corporations to provide walkways adjacent to portions of
  4 23 rail yard tracks where railroad employees perform switching
  4 24 activities at least one shift per day for five days per week.
  4 25    The bill provides recommendations and requirements for the
  4 26 type of material used for the walkways. In addition, the
  4 27 bill requires that walkways be at least two feet wide, with
  4 28 cross slopes of not more than one inch of elevation for each
  4 29 eight inches of length in any direction. Walkways must have
  4 30 a reasonably uniform surface, be maintained in safe condition
  4 31 without compromising track drainage, and be kept reasonably
  4 32 free of spilled fuel oil, sand, posts, vegetation, nonballast
  4 33 rocks, and other hazards and obstructions.
  4 34    Following an administrative hearing, the department of
  4 35 transportation may order a railroad corporation to construct a
  5  1 walkway or alter a preexisting walkway to conform with the new
  5  2 requirements where the lack of a walkway or the condition of a
  5  3 walkway poses a safety hazard to railroad employees.
  5  4    The bill excuses a railroad corporation from compliance with
  5  5 walkway requirements during maintenance activities, in the
  5  6 event of a derailment, during certain weather conditions, in
  5  7 certain seismic conditions, and for a reasonable time after
  5  8 such weather or seismic conditions subside to allow a return
  5  9 to compliance.
  5 10    The department of transportation may grant a waiver of any
  5 11 provision of the bill to a railroad corporation upon a showing
  5 12 of good cause, including but not limited to a showing that
  5 13 compliance with the bill will impose an undue hardship on the
  5 14 railroad corporation.
  5 15    A person who alleges a violation of the requirements of the
  5 16 bill must address the allegation with the railroad corporation
  5 17 by making a written complaint. If the railroad corporation
  5 18 does not respond to the complaint within 30 days, or does not
  5 19 resolve the alleged violation within 90 days, the person may
  5 20 file a formal complaint with the department of transportation.
  5 21 The department shall notify the railroad corporation of the
  5 22 complaint, and the railroad corporation has 30 days in which
  5 23 to respond, either by correcting the alleged violation or by
  5 24 contesting the complaint. If the railroad corporation contests
  5 25 the complaint, the department is required to inspect the area
  5 26 of the alleged violation. Upon a finding that a violation
  5 27 exists, the department must order the railroad corporation to
  5 28 correct the violation within 30 days of receipt of the order.
  5 29 If, following the inspection, the department finds that no
  5 30 violation exists, it must notify the parties to the complaint
