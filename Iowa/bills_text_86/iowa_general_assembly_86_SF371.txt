  6 35                           EXPLANATION
  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
  7  4 facilities property tax levy and the equipment replacement and
  7  5 program sharing property tax levy for a merged area.
  7  6    Current Code section 260C.22 provides that in addition to a
  7  7 merged area's property tax levy under Code section 260C.17, the
  7  8 voters in a merged area may vote a tax levy not exceeding 20 and
  7  9 one=fourth cents per $1,000 of assessed value for a period not
  7 10 to exceed 10 years for the purchase of grounds, construction of
  7 11 buildings, payment of debts contracted for the construction of
  7 12 buildings, purchase of buildings and equipment for buildings,
  7 13 and the acquisition of libraries, for the purpose of paying
  7 14 costs of utilities, and for the purpose of maintaining,
  7 15 remodeling, improving, or expanding the community college of
  7 16 the merged area.
  7 17    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  7 18 elections where the question of imposition of the tax was on
  7 19 the ballot, if the tax has been imposed for a period of at least
  7 20 20 consecutive years, the board of directors of the merged area
  7 21 may, by resolution adopted at any time before the end of the
  7 22 most recently authorized period of time for imposing the tax,
  7 23 continue to impose the voted tax each year for an additional
  7 24 period not to exceed 10 years at a rate not to exceed the
  7 25 maximum rate approved at election until the tax is discontinued
  7 26 or its rate increased following an election initiated by
  7 27 petition.  The bill also specifies that the election to impose
  7 28 the levy under Code section 260C.22 shall be initiated by
  7 29 resolution of the board of directors of the merged area.
  7 30    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  7 31 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  7 32 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  7 33 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  7 34 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  7 35 authority of the board of directors to impose the voted tax or
  8  1 to increase the maximum rate of the tax.  The petition must be
  8  2 signed by eligible electors equal in number to not less than
  8  3 25 percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding
  8  4 election in the merged area where the question of imposition
  8  5 of the tax appeared on the ballot and received by the board
  8  6 of directors by June 1 of the year in which the election is
  8  7 to be held. If a majority of those voting on the question
  8  8 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the levy for
  8  9 any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the period
  8 10 of time for which the tax was last approved at election or
  8 11 by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether to
  8 12 discontinue the board's authority to impose the tax fails to be
  8 13 approved at election, the question may not be submitted to the
  8 14 voters for a period of 10 years.
  8 15    The bill also strikes obsolete provisions of Code section
  8 16 260C.22 relating to the imposition of the voted tax in specific
  8 17 years.
  8 18    Current Code section 260C.28 provides that in addition to
  8 19 a property tax levy of $0.03 per $1,000 of assessed value for
  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be
  8 28 for a period not to exceed 10 years.
  8 29    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  8 30 elections where the question of imposition of the additional
  8 31 tax was on the ballot, if the additional tax has been imposed
  8 32 for a period of at least 20 consecutive years and the period
  8 33 of time approved for imposing the additional tax is due to
  8 34 expire, the board of directors of the merged area may, by
  8 35 resolution, continue to impose the additional tax each year for
  9  1 an additional period not to exceed 10 years until the tax is
  9  2 discontinued following an election initiated by petition.
  9  3    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  9  4 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  9  5 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  9  7 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  9  8 authority of the board of directors to impose the additional
  9  9 tax. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal
  9 10 in number to not less than 25 percent of the number of votes
  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared
  9 13 on the ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question
  9 14 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the additional
  9 15 tax for any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the
  9 16 period of time for which the tax was last approved at election
  9 17 or by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether
  9 18 to discontinue the board's authority to impose the additional
  9 19 tax fails to be approved at election, the question may not be
  9 20 submitted to the voters for a period of 10 years.
  9 21    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to merged
  9 22 area taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill
  9 23 and merged area taxes approved at election on or after the

  7  6    Current Code section 260C.22 provides that in addition to a
  7  7 merged area's property tax levy under Code section 260C.17, the
  7  8 voters in a merged area may vote a tax levy not exceeding 20 and
  7  9 one=fourth cents per $1,000 of assessed value for a period not
  7 10 to exceed 10 years for the purchase of grounds, construction of
  7 11 buildings, payment of debts contracted for the construction of
  7 12 buildings, purchase of buildings and equipment for buildings,
  7 13 and the acquisition of libraries, for the purpose of paying
  7 14 costs of utilities, and for the purpose of maintaining,
  7 15 remodeling, improving, or expanding the community college of
  7 16 the merged area.
  7 17    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  7 18 elections where the question of imposition of the tax was on
  7 19 the ballot, if the tax has been imposed for a period of at least
  7 20 20 consecutive years, the board of directors of the merged area
  7 21 may, by resolution adopted at any time before the end of the
  7 22 most recently authorized period of time for imposing the tax,
  7 23 continue to impose the voted tax each year for an additional
  7 24 period not to exceed 10 years at a rate not to exceed the
  7 25 maximum rate approved at election until the tax is discontinued
  7 26 or its rate increased following an election initiated by
  7 27 petition.  The bill also specifies that the election to impose
  7 28 the levy under Code section 260C.22 shall be initiated by
  7 29 resolution of the board of directors of the merged area.
  7 30    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  7 31 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  7 32 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  7 33 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  7 34 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  7 35 authority of the board of directors to impose the voted tax or
  8  1 to increase the maximum rate of the tax.  The petition must be
  8  2 signed by eligible electors equal in number to not less than
  8  3 25 percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding
  8  4 election in the merged area where the question of imposition
  8  5 of the tax appeared on the ballot and received by the board
  8  6 of directors by June 1 of the year in which the election is
  8  7 to be held. If a majority of those voting on the question
  8  8 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the levy for
  8  9 any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the period
  8 10 of time for which the tax was last approved at election or
  8 11 by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether to
  8 12 discontinue the board's authority to impose the tax fails to be
  8 13 approved at election, the question may not be submitted to the
  8 14 voters for a period of 10 years.
  8 15    The bill also strikes obsolete provisions of Code section
  8 16 260C.22 relating to the imposition of the voted tax in specific
  8 17 years.
  8 18    Current Code section 260C.28 provides that in addition to
  8 19 a property tax levy of $0.03 per $1,000 of assessed value for
  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be
  8 28 for a period not to exceed 10 years.
  8 29    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  8 30 elections where the question of imposition of the additional
  8 31 tax was on the ballot, if the additional tax has been imposed
  8 32 for a period of at least 20 consecutive years and the period
  8 33 of time approved for imposing the additional tax is due to
  8 34 expire, the board of directors of the merged area may, by
  8 35 resolution, continue to impose the additional tax each year for
  9  1 an additional period not to exceed 10 years until the tax is
  9  2 discontinued following an election initiated by petition.
  9  3    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  9  4 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  9  5 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  9  7 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  9  8 authority of the board of directors to impose the additional
  9  9 tax. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal
  9 10 in number to not less than 25 percent of the number of votes
  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared
  9 13 on the ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question
  9 14 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the additional
  9 15 tax for any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the
  9 16 period of time for which the tax was last approved at election
  9 17 or by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether
  9 18 to discontinue the board's authority to impose the additional
  9 19 tax fails to be approved at election, the question may not be

  6 35                           EXPLANATION
  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
  7  4 facilities property tax levy and the equipment replacement and
  7  5 program sharing property tax levy for a merged area.
  7  6    Current Code section 260C.22 provides that in addition to a
  7  7 merged area's property tax levy under Code section 260C.17, the
  7  8 voters in a merged area may vote a tax levy not exceeding 20 and
  7  9 one=fourth cents per $1,000 of assessed value for a period not
  7 10 to exceed 10 years for the purchase of grounds, construction of
  7 11 buildings, payment of debts contracted for the construction of
  7 12 buildings, purchase of buildings and equipment for buildings,
  7 13 and the acquisition of libraries, for the purpose of paying
  7 14 costs of utilities, and for the purpose of maintaining,
  7 15 remodeling, improving, or expanding the community college of
  7 16 the merged area.
  7 17    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  7 18 elections where the question of imposition of the tax was on
  7 19 the ballot, if the tax has been imposed for a period of at least
  7 20 20 consecutive years, the board of directors of the merged area
  7 21 may, by resolution adopted at any time before the end of the
  7 22 most recently authorized period of time for imposing the tax,
  7 23 continue to impose the voted tax each year for an additional
  7 24 period not to exceed 10 years at a rate not to exceed the
  7 25 maximum rate approved at election until the tax is discontinued
  7 26 or its rate increased following an election initiated by
  7 27 petition.  The bill also specifies that the election to impose
  7 28 the levy under Code section 260C.22 shall be initiated by
  7 29 resolution of the board of directors of the merged area.
  7 30    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  7 31 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  7 32 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  7 33 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  7 34 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  7 35 authority of the board of directors to impose the voted tax or
  8  1 to increase the maximum rate of the tax.  The petition must be
  8  2 signed by eligible electors equal in number to not less than
  8  3 25 percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding
  8  4 election in the merged area where the question of imposition
  8  5 of the tax appeared on the ballot and received by the board
  8  6 of directors by June 1 of the year in which the election is
  8  7 to be held. If a majority of those voting on the question
  8  8 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the levy for
  8  9 any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the period
  8 10 of time for which the tax was last approved at election or
  8 11 by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether to
  8 12 discontinue the board's authority to impose the tax fails to be
  8 13 approved at election, the question may not be submitted to the
  8 14 voters for a period of 10 years.
  8 15    The bill also strikes obsolete provisions of Code section
  8 16 260C.22 relating to the imposition of the voted tax in specific
  8 17 years.
  8 18    Current Code section 260C.28 provides that in addition to
  8 19 a property tax levy of $0.03 per $1,000 of assessed value for
  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be
  8 28 for a period not to exceed 10 years.
  8 29    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  8 30 elections where the question of imposition of the additional
  8 31 tax was on the ballot, if the additional tax has been imposed
  8 32 for a period of at least 20 consecutive years and the period
  8 33 of time approved for imposing the additional tax is due to
  8 34 expire, the board of directors of the merged area may, by
  8 35 resolution, continue to impose the additional tax each year for
  9  1 an additional period not to exceed 10 years until the tax is
  9  2 discontinued following an election initiated by petition.
  9  3    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  9  4 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  9  5 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  9  7 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  9  8 authority of the board of directors to impose the additional
  9  9 tax. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal
  9 10 in number to not less than 25 percent of the number of votes
  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared
  9 13 on the ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question
  9 14 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the additional
  9 15 tax for any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the
  9 16 period of time for which the tax was last approved at election
  9 17 or by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether
  9 18 to discontinue the board's authority to impose the additional
  9 19 tax fails to be approved at election, the question may not be
  9 20 submitted to the voters for a period of 10 years.
  9 21    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to merged
  9 22 area taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill

  7  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  3    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
  7  4 facilities property tax levy and the equipment replacement and
  7  5 program sharing property tax levy for a merged area.
  7  6    Current Code section 260C.22 provides that in addition to a
  7  7 merged area's property tax levy under Code section 260C.17, the
  7  8 voters in a merged area may vote a tax levy not exceeding 20 and
  7  9 one=fourth cents per $1,000 of assessed value for a period not
  7 10 to exceed 10 years for the purchase of grounds, construction of
  7 11 buildings, payment of debts contracted for the construction of
  7 12 buildings, purchase of buildings and equipment for buildings,
  7 13 and the acquisition of libraries, for the purpose of paying
  7 14 costs of utilities, and for the purpose of maintaining,
  7 15 remodeling, improving, or expanding the community college of
  7 16 the merged area.
  7 17    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  7 18 elections where the question of imposition of the tax was on
  7 19 the ballot, if the tax has been imposed for a period of at least
  7 20 20 consecutive years, the board of directors of the merged area
  7 21 may, by resolution adopted at any time before the end of the
  7 22 most recently authorized period of time for imposing the tax,
  7 23 continue to impose the voted tax each year for an additional
  7 24 period not to exceed 10 years at a rate not to exceed the
  7 25 maximum rate approved at election until the tax is discontinued
  7 26 or its rate increased following an election initiated by
  7 27 petition.  The bill also specifies that the election to impose
  7 28 the levy under Code section 260C.22 shall be initiated by
  7 29 resolution of the board of directors of the merged area.
  7 30    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  7 31 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  7 32 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  7 33 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  7 34 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  7 35 authority of the board of directors to impose the voted tax or
  8  1 to increase the maximum rate of the tax.  The petition must be
  8  2 signed by eligible electors equal in number to not less than
  8  3 25 percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding
  8  4 election in the merged area where the question of imposition
  8  5 of the tax appeared on the ballot and received by the board
  8  6 of directors by June 1 of the year in which the election is
  8  7 to be held. If a majority of those voting on the question
  8  8 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the levy for
  8  9 any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the period
  8 10 of time for which the tax was last approved at election or
  8 11 by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether to
  8 12 discontinue the board's authority to impose the tax fails to be
  8 13 approved at election, the question may not be submitted to the
  8 14 voters for a period of 10 years.
  8 15    The bill also strikes obsolete provisions of Code section
  8 16 260C.22 relating to the imposition of the voted tax in specific
  8 17 years.
  8 18    Current Code section 260C.28 provides that in addition to
  8 19 a property tax levy of $0.03 per $1,000 of assessed value for
  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be
  8 28 for a period not to exceed 10 years.
  8 29    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  8 30 elections where the question of imposition of the additional
  8 31 tax was on the ballot, if the additional tax has been imposed
  8 32 for a period of at least 20 consecutive years and the period
  8 33 of time approved for imposing the additional tax is due to
  8 34 expire, the board of directors of the merged area may, by
  8 35 resolution, continue to impose the additional tax each year for
  9  1 an additional period not to exceed 10 years until the tax is
  9  2 discontinued following an election initiated by petition.
  9  3    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  9  4 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  9  5 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  9  7 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  9  8 authority of the board of directors to impose the additional
  9  9 tax. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal
  9 10 in number to not less than 25 percent of the number of votes
  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared
  9 13 on the ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question
  9 14 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the additional
  9 15 tax for any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the
  9 16 period of time for which the tax was last approved at election
  9 17 or by the board, as applicable. If the question of whether
  9 18 to discontinue the board's authority to impose the additional
  9 19 tax fails to be approved at election, the question may not be
  9 20 submitted to the voters for a period of 10 years.
  9 21    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to merged
  9 22 area taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill
  9 23 and merged area taxes approved at election on or after the
  9 24 effective date of the bill.

  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be

  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters

  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of

  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for

  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared

  8 15    The bill also strikes obsolete provisions of Code section
  8 16 260C.22 relating to the imposition of the voted tax in specific
  8 17 years.
  8 18    Current Code section 260C.28 provides that in addition to
  8 19 a property tax levy of $0.03 per $1,000 of assessed value for
  8 20 equipment replacement, the board of directors of a merged area
  8 21 may certify for levy at a rate in excess of the $0.03 per $1,000
  8 22 of assessed value, if the excess tax levied does not cause the
  8 23 total rate certified to exceed a rate of $0.09 per $1,000 of
  8 24 assessed value, and the excess revenue generated is used for
  8 25 purposes of program sharing between community colleges or for
  8 26 the purchase of instructional equipment, and the additional
  8 27 levy is approved at election.  The approval at election may be
  8 28 for a period not to exceed 10 years.
  8 29    Under the bill, following approval at two consecutive
  8 30 elections where the question of imposition of the additional
  8 31 tax was on the ballot, if the additional tax has been imposed
  8 32 for a period of at least 20 consecutive years and the period
  8 33 of time approved for imposing the additional tax is due to
  8 34 expire, the board of directors of the merged area may, by
  8 35 resolution, continue to impose the additional tax each year for
  9  1 an additional period not to exceed 10 years until the tax is
  9  2 discontinued following an election initiated by petition.
  9  3    The bill provides that upon the receipt of a petition
  9  4 containing the required number of signatures, the board of
  9  5 directors of a merged area shall direct the appropriate county
  9  6 commissioners of elections to submit to the registered voters
  9  7 of the merged area the question of whether to discontinue the
  9  8 authority of the board of directors to impose the additional
  9  9 tax. The petition must be signed by eligible electors equal
  9 10 in number to not less than 25 percent of the number of votes
  9 11 cast at the last preceding election in the merged area where
  9 12 the question of the imposition of the additional tax appeared
  9 13 on the ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question
  9 14 favors discontinuance, the board may not impose the additional
  9 15 tax for any fiscal year beginning after the expiration of the
  9 16 period of time for which the tax was last approved at election
