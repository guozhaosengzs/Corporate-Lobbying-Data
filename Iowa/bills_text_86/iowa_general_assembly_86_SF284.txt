  2 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 16    Current Code section 425.15 provides a homestead credit to
  2 17 the owner of a homestead for the full amount of tax levied
  2 18 if the owner is any of the following: (1) a veteran of any
  2 19 of the military forces of the United States who acquired the
  2 20 homestead under specified federal programs; (2) a veteran
  2 21 with a service=connected disability rating of 100 percent;
  2 22 (3) a former member of the national guard of any state who
  2 23 meets specified service requirements with a service=connected
  2 24 disability rating of 100 percent; or (4) an individual who is a
  2 25 surviving spouse or a child and who is receiving dependency and
  2 26 indemnity compensation.
  2 27    This bill amends the eligibility criteria for the credit
  2 28 by requiring the service=connected disability rating of 100
  2 29 percent to be permanent. The bill also amends the eligibility
  2 30 criteria for the credit to include a veteran with a permanent
  2 31 and total disability rating based on individual unemployability
  2 32 that is compensated at the 100 percent disability rate and
  2 33 certain members of the national guard with a permanent and
  2 34 total disability rating based on individual unemployability
  2 35 that are compensated at the 100 percent disability rate.
  3  1 The bill defines "permanent and total disability rating
  3  2 based on individual unemployability" to mean a condition
  3  3 under which a person has either a permanent service=connected
  3  4 disability rating of 60 percent or two or more permanent
  3  5 service=connected disability conditions in which one of the
  3  6 conditions has at least a 40 percent rating and the combined
  3  7 rating for all the conditions is at least 70 percent, and
  3  8 the person has an administrative adjustment added to the
  3  9 service=connected disability rating, due to individual
  3 10 unemployability, such that the United States department of
  3 11 veterans affairs rates the veteran as permanently and totally
  3 12 disabled for purposes of disability compensation.
  3 13    The bill specifies that for purposes of qualifying for the
  3 14 credit, the receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation
  3 15 by an individual who is a surviving spouse or a child must be
  3 16 certified by the United States department of veterans affairs.
  3 17 The bill also removes the provision that terminates eligibility
  3 18 for the credit for a surviving spouse receiving dependency and
  3 19 indemnity compensation when the surviving spouse remarries.
  3 20    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 21 retroactively to May 26, 2014, for applications for the
