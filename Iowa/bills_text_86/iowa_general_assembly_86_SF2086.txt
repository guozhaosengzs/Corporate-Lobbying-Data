  6  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  6    This bill relates to the exclusion of retirement income from

  6 13 In addition, a taxpayer who is disabled, who is at least 55
  6 14 years of age, or who is the surviving spouse or other specified
  6 15 survivor of that qualifying taxpayer, may exclude a maximum
