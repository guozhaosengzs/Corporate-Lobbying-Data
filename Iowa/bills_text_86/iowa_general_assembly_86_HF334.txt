  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  7 20 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  7 21    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  7 22 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  7 23 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  7 24 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  7 25 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  7 26 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  7 27 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population
  7 32 requirements shall designate an area surrounding the lake, if
  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's
  7 35 determination that the area is in need of improvements.  This
  8  1 bill strikes "shall" from that provision and inserts "may".
  8  2    The bill provides that as part of the approval process
  8  3 for a rural improvement zone, the petition must include
  8  4 a statement of the need for the proposed zone including
  8  5 specified information based upon a report prepared by a
  8  6 licensed professional engineer.  The information required to be
  8  7 included relates to the size of the lake, soil classification,
  8  8 silt accumulation data and estimates, and cost estimates.
  8  9 In addition, the petition must be signed by 25 percent of
  8 10 the residents of a proposed rural improvement zone who own
  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  7 20 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  7 21    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  7 22 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  7 23 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  7 24 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  7 25 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  7 26 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  7 27 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population
  7 32 requirements shall designate an area surrounding the lake, if
  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's
  7 35 determination that the area is in need of improvements.  This
  8  1 bill strikes "shall" from that provision and inserts "may".
  8  2    The bill provides that as part of the approval process
  8  3 for a rural improvement zone, the petition must include
  8  4 a statement of the need for the proposed zone including
  8  5 specified information based upon a report prepared by a
  8  6 licensed professional engineer.  The information required to be
  8  7 included relates to the size of the lake, soil classification,
  8  8 silt accumulation data and estimates, and cost estimates.
  8  9 In addition, the petition must be signed by 25 percent of
  8 10 the residents of a proposed rural improvement zone who own
  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  7 19    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  7 20 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  7 21    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  7 22 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using

  7 26 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  7 27 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population
  7 32 requirements shall designate an area surrounding the lake, if
  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's
  7 35 determination that the area is in need of improvements.  This
  8  1 bill strikes "shall" from that provision and inserts "may".
  8  2    The bill provides that as part of the approval process
  8  3 for a rural improvement zone, the petition must include
  8  4 a statement of the need for the proposed zone including
  8  5 specified information based upon a report prepared by a
  8  6 licensed professional engineer.  The information required to be
  8  7 included relates to the size of the lake, soil classification,
  8  8 silt accumulation data and estimates, and cost estimates.
  8  9 In addition, the petition must be signed by 25 percent of
  8 10 the residents of a proposed rural improvement zone who own
  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  7 19    This bill relates to the establishment, operation, and
  7 20 dissolution of rural improvement zones under Code chapter 357H.
  7 21    Current law provides that the population threshold for
  7 22 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  7 23 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  7 24 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  7 25 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  7 26 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  7 27 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population
  7 32 requirements shall designate an area surrounding the lake, if
  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's
  7 35 determination that the area is in need of improvements.  This
  8  1 bill strikes "shall" from that provision and inserts "may".
  8  2    The bill provides that as part of the approval process
  8  3 for a rural improvement zone, the petition must include
  8  4 a statement of the need for the proposed zone including
  8  5 specified information based upon a report prepared by a
  8  6 licensed professional engineer.  The information required to be
  8  7 included relates to the size of the lake, soil classification,
  8  8 silt accumulation data and estimates, and cost estimates.
  8  9 In addition, the petition must be signed by 25 percent of
  8 10 the residents of a proposed rural improvement zone who own
  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,

 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the

  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  7 22 establishing a rural improvement zone is determined using
  7 23 the 2000 certified federal census.  The bill changes that
  7 24 requirement so that the population is determined using the
  7 25 most recent certified federal census.  The bill also adds a
  7 26 definition of "lake" for purposes of determining eligibility to
  7 27 establish a rural improvement zone.  The bill defines "lake"
  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population
  7 32 requirements shall designate an area surrounding the lake, if
  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's
  7 35 determination that the area is in need of improvements.  This
  8  1 bill strikes "shall" from that provision and inserts "may".
  8  2    The bill provides that as part of the approval process
  8  3 for a rural improvement zone, the petition must include
  8  4 a statement of the need for the proposed zone including
  8  5 specified information based upon a report prepared by a
  8  6 licensed professional engineer.  The information required to be
  8  7 included relates to the size of the lake, soil classification,
  8  8 silt accumulation data and estimates, and cost estimates.
  8  9 In addition, the petition must be signed by 25 percent of
  8 10 the residents of a proposed rural improvement zone who own
  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from

 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended

 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the

 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the

  8 11 a homestead within the proposed zone that is eligible for
  8 12 the homestead credit under Code chapter 425 at the time the
  8 13 petition is filed. Current law requires that the petitioners
  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines

  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the

  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the

  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement

  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  7 28 to mean a body of water that has a surface area of at least 80
  7 29 acres and is not a river or stream.
  7 30    Current Code section 357H.1 provides that a board of
  7 31 supervisors of a county meeting specified population

  7 33 it is an unincorporated area of the county, a rural improvement
  7 34 zone upon receipt of a petition, and upon the board's

  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.

  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the

  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's

  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement

  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in

  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value

  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each

  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is

 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from

 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the

  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the

  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal

  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each

  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.

 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the

  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes

  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent

  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in

  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be

  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each

  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is

  8 14 be residents of the proposed rural improvement zone.
  8 15    The bill changes the period of time required for holding
  8 16 a public hearing on the petition from within 30 days of
  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or
 10 31 denial of such an extension.

  8 17 presentation of the petition to within 60 days.  In addition,
  8 18 the bill provides that if the board of supervisors determines
  8 19 that the petition does not substantially meet the statutory
  8 20 requirements, the board may, within 30 days of presentation
  8 21 of the petition, request additional information from the
  8 22 petitioners. The board's request for additional information is
  8 23 limited to the statutorily required information that was not
  8 24 contained in the petition. The bill limits the board to one
  8 25 request for additional information. Upon presentation of the
  8 26 additional information, the public hearing must be held within
  8 27 60 days of receiving the additional information.
  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
 10 22 to review or not to review the zone's dissolution date, and,
 10 23 if the board intends to review, the board of trustees must
 10 24 submit a report prepared by a licensed professional engineer
 10 25 that includes the information required in the petition seeking
 10 26 establishment of the zone, and the board of supervisors must
 10 27 hold a public hearing to determine the continued need for the
 10 28 rural improvement zone. The bill specifies that holding a
 10 29 public hearing relating to the extension of a rural improvement
 10 30 zone's dissolution date is not dispositive of the approval or

  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the

  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended

 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must

  8 28    The bill specifies that holding a public hearing relating
  8 29 to the establishment of a rural improvement zone is not
  8 30 dispositive of the approval or denial of a petition by the
  8 31 board.
  8 32    The bill strikes the provision which prohibited the issuance
  8 33 of certificates for the payment of a rural improvement zone's
  8 34 improvements and activities after January 1, 2007, and provides
  8 35 that such certificates, including those to refund other
  9  1 certificates, may not be issued if the maturity date of the
  9  2 certificate is after the date the rural improvement zone is
  9  3 authorized to operate, as provided by the bill.
  9  4    Current Code section 357H.9 authorizes rural improvement
  9  5 zones to authorize the use of taxes from a division of taxes
  9  6 (tax increment financing).  The bill provides that for fiscal
  9  7 years beginning on or after July 1, 2015, when calculating
  9  8 the amount of taxes subject to the division of taxes, if the
  9  9 assessed value of the taxable property in the rural improvement
  9 10 zone used to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the
  9 11 other taxing districts (base value) is less than 50 percent
  9 12 of the assessed value of the taxable property in the rural
  9 13 improvement zone used to calculate the total amount of property
  9 14 taxes in the rural improvement zone for the fiscal year in
  9 15 which the taxes are due and payable, the assessed value of
  9 16 the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used to
  9 17 calculate the amount of taxes to be paid to the other taxing
  9 18 districts (base value) shall be increased for that fiscal
  9 19 year to an amount equal to 50 percent of the assessed value
  9 20 of the taxable property in the rural improvement zone used
  9 21 to calculate the total amount of property taxes in the rural
  9 22 improvement zone for the fiscal year in which the taxes are
  9 23 due and payable. In addition, upon the board of supervisors'
  9 24 approval of each extension of the rural improvement zone's
  9 25 dissolution date, as provided in the bill, the year of the
  9 26 assessment roll used to calculate the amount of taxes to be
  9 27 paid to the other taxing districts is adjusted by increasing
  9 28 the year of the assessment roll by 10 assessment years.
  9 29    The bill provides that not later than December 1 of each
  9 30 year the board of trustees of a zone shall file with the
  9 31 county auditor an annual financial report showing the rural
  9 32 improvement zone's financial condition as of June 30 and the
  9 33 results of operations for the year then ended.  The bill also
  9 34 provides that all rural improvement zones are subject to annual
  9 35 audit either by the auditor of state or by a certified public
 10  1 accountant contracted with or employed by the rural improvement
 10  2 zone to conduct the audit.
 10  3    The bill provides that each rural improvement zone is
 10  4 dissolved on the date four years after the effective date of
 10  5 the bill or 20 years from the first day of the calendar year
 10  6 following the calendar year in which the rural improvement
 10  7 zone first certifies to the county auditor for payment from
 10  8 the division of taxes, whichever is later.  The bill further
 10  9 provides that the date required for dissolution may be extended
 10 10 by resolution of the board of supervisors adopted not less
 10 11 than 18 months prior to the date required for dissolution or
 10 12 a date not less than 18 months prior to the date to which
 10 13 the rural improvement zone was previously extended by the
 10 14 board of supervisors under the provisions of the bill.  Each
 10 15 extension shall be for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The
 10 16 date required for dissolution of a rural improvement zone
 10 17 may only be extended two times under the provisions of the
 10 18 bill.  Prior to an extension, the board of trustees must
 10 19 request in writing a review of the zone's dissolution date
 10 20 by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors must
 10 21 notify the board of trustees in writing of the board's intent
