 14  2     14  2     14  3 includes the acquisition or installation of information
 14  4 technology infrastructure.  For purposes of this paragraph,
 14  5 "information technology infrastructure" means the basic,
 14  6 underlying physical framework or system necessary to deliver
 14  7 technology connectivity to a school district and to network
 14  8 school buildings within a school district.
 14  9                           EXPLANATION
 14 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 12    This bill relates to and provides for the coordination and
 14 13 facilitation of broadband access in targeted service areas of
 14 14 the state.  The bill is titled the "Connecting Iowa Farms,
 14 15 Schools, and Communities Act".
 14 16    DIVISION I ====  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  The division provides
 14 17 that the general assembly finds and declares that increasing
 14 18 the extent and availability of broadband infrastructure
 14 19 throughout the state facilitates the provision of internet
 14 20 access to citizens, businesses, farms, and communities at
 14 21 speeds that promote economic development, employment, enhanced
 14 22 access to goods and services, increased educational and
 14 23 training opportunities, faster access to government services
 14 24 and health care, and improved overall information and community
 14 25 access.
 14 26    DIVISION II ==== STATEWIDE BROADBAND COORDINATION.  The
 14 27 division modifies provisions in Code chapter 8B, relating to
 14 28 the office of the chief information officer.  The division adds
 14 29 several definitions to the Code chapter for use in the Code
 14 30 chapter and in other related provisions.  The division defines
 14 31 "broadband" to mean a high=speed, high=capacity electronic
 14 32 transmission medium, including fixed wireless and mobile
 14 33 wireless mediums, that can carry data signals from independent
 14 34 network sources by establishing different bandwidth channels
 14 35 and that is commonly used to deliver internet services to the
 15  1 public.  The division defines "broadband infrastructure" to
 15  2 mean the physical infrastructure used for the transmission
 15  3 of data that provides broadband services. The division
 15  4 defines "communications service provider" to mean a service
 15  5 provider that provides broadband service.  The division defines
 15  6 "targeted service area" to mean a United States census bureau
 15  7 census block located in Iowa, including any crop operation
 15  8 located within the census block, within which no communications
 15  9 service provider offers or facilitates broadband service
 15 10 at or above 25 megabits per second of download speed and 3
 15 11 megabits per second of upload speed.  The division defines
 15 12 "crop operation" by referencing a definition contained in Code
 15 13 section 717A.1 as meaning a commercial enterprise where a crop
 15 14 is maintained on the property of the commercial enterprise.
 15 15 Additionally, the division adds broadband and broadband
 15 16 infrastructure to an existing definition of "information
 15 17 technology".
 15 18    The division adds to the powers and duties of the chief
 15 19 information officer streamlining, consolidating, and
 15 20 coordinating access to and availability of broadband and
 15 21 broadband infrastructure throughout Iowa.
 15 22    The division provides that the determination of whether
 15 23 a provider's download and upload speeds are being met for
 15 24 purposes of the definition of "targeted service area" shall be
 15 25 by reference to broadband availability maps or data sources
 15 26 identified by the office by rule.  The division directs the
 15 27 office to establish procedures to allow challenges to the
 15 28 office's finding on whether an area meets the definition of
 15 29 "targeted service area".
 15 30    The division establishes a connecting Iowa farms, schools,
 15 31 and communities grant program and fund.  The division requires
 15 32 the office of the chief information officer to administer
 15 33 a broadband grant program to award grants to communication
 15 34 service providers that reduce or eliminate targeted service
 15 35 areas by installing broadband infrastructure in targeted
 16  1 service areas.  The division establishes a fund, consisting
 16  2 of moneys appropriated to it or appropriated to the office
 16  3 or otherwise available to the office for purposes of the
 16  4 grant program.  The moneys in the fund are appropriated
 16  5 to the office of the chief information officer.  The bill
 16  6 provides that communication service providers may apply to
 16  7 the office for a grant. The division requires the office to
 16  8 include representatives from schools, communities, agriculture,
 16  9 industry, and other areas as appropriate to review and
 16 10 recommend grant awards.  The division also requires the
 16 11 office to conduct an open application review process and
 16 12 include a public internet site for applications, results,
 16 13 and performance.  The division sets criteria for the office
 16 14 to consider when awarding grants.  The division limits grant
 16 15 amounts to a maximum of 10 percent of the communication service
 16 16 provider's project cost.
 16 17    The division also adds to the powers and duties of the chief
 16 18 information officer the responsibility for coordinating a new
 16 19 fiberoptic network conduit installation program to facilitate
 16 20 incorporation of fiberoptic network conduit installations, as
 16 21 defined by the bill, into state=funded construction projects
 16 22 or by state=owned infrastructure.  The division provides that,
 16 23 subject to funding from the general assembly, the office
 16 24 may contract with a third party to manage, lease, install,
 16 25 or otherwise provide fiberoptic network conduit access, and
 16 26 the program shall not prohibit the office from purchasing or
 16 27 installing fiberoptic cable within fiberoptic network conduit
 16 28 installed pursuant to the program.
 16 29    Additionally, the division specifies expeditious response
 16 30 requirements regarding the approval, modification, or
 16 31 disapproval of nonwireless broadband=related permits. The
 16 32 division provides that, notwithstanding any other provision to
 16 33 the contrary, a political subdivision vested with permitting
 16 34 authority shall approve, approve with modification, or
 16 35 disapprove nonwireless broadband=related permits within 60
 17  1 business days following the submission of a permit application
 17  2 and fee. In the event that no action is taken during the 60=day
 17  3 period, the application shall be deemed approved.
 17  4    The division also requires the chief information officer
 17  5 to prepare an annual report regarding the status of broadband
 17  6 expansion and coordination, the broadband grant program, and
 17  7 the adequacy of the speed set in the definition of targeted
 17  8 service area. The division adds the chief information officer
 17  9 to the Iowa telecommunications and technology commission
 17 10 which oversees the operation of the Iowa communications
 17 11 network and to the statewide interoperable communications
 17 12 system board established in Code section 80.28.  The division
 17 13 makes corresponding changes. Further, the division adds an
 17 14 additional member to the board who is an emergency medical
 17 15 care provider, and eliminates a provision that required the
 17 16 commission to consult with the director of the department of
 17 17 administrative services and the chief information officer when
 17 18 appointing the commission's executive director.
 17 19    DIVISION III ==== PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVES AND ASSESSMENT.  The
 17 20 division provides a property tax exemption for installation of
 17 21 broadband infrastructure that facilitates broadband service at
 17 22 or above 25 megabits per second of download speed and three
 17 23 megabits per second of upload speed within a targeted service
 17 24 area, which installation is commenced and completed on or
 17 25 after July 1, 2014, and which is used to deliver internet
 17 26 services to the public.  The exemption shall be a 100 percent
 17 27 exemption from taxation for a period of 10 years based on
 17 28 the actual value added by the installation of the broadband
 17 29 infrastructure. The division specifies procedures relating
 17 30 to applying for the tax exemption with the county board of
 17 31 supervisors within which the broadband infrastructure is
 17 32 located, granting the tax exemption, and assessing the property
 17 33 of companies receiving the exemption.
 17 34    The division applies to assessment years beginning on or
 17 35 after January 1, 2016. The division provides that property
 18  1 owners seeking an exemption for installation of broadband
 18  2 infrastructure commenced between July 1, 2014, and the
 18  3 effective date of the division of the bill must certify to
 18  4 the local assessor that the installation of the broadband
 18  5 infrastructure took place within a targeted service area prior
 18  6 to applying for an exemption. All other property owners
 18  7 must certify to the local assessor prior to commencement of
 18  8 the installation. The division also provides that property
 18  9 owners seeking an exemption for the installation of broadband
 18 10 infrastructure commenced and completed between July 1, 2014,
 18 11 and December 31, 2014, shall first file an application for an
 18 12 exemption with the county board of supervisors by February 1,
 18 13 2016, or the following two assessment years.  An exemption
 18 14 filed pursuant to this provision of the division is allowed for
 18 15 10 years.
 18 16    Code section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax credit
 18 17 or exemption enacted on or after January 1, 1997, if a state
 18 18 appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
 18 19 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
 18 20 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
 18 21 that portion of the credit or exemption estimated by the
 18 22 department of revenue to be funded by the state appropriation.
 18 23 The division provides that Code section 25B.7 does not apply to
