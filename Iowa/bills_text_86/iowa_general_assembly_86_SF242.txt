  2  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  3    This bill specifies solar energy purchase requirements
  2  4 applicable to electric public utilities.
  2  5    Currently, electric utilities are required to own alternate
  2  6 energy production facilities or small hydro facilities located
  2  7 in Iowa, or to enter into long=term contracts to purchase or
  2  8 wheel electricity from such facilities.  Alternate energy
  2  9 production facilities are defined in Code section 476.42
  2 10 to include solar, wind turbine, waste management, resource
  2 11 recovery, refuse=derived fuel, agricultural crops or residues,
  2 12 or woodburning facilities.
  2 13    There is a limitation on the amount of electricity required
  2 14 to be produced by a facility which is owned by an electric
  2 15 utility, or purchased or wheeled from an alternate energy
  2 16 production facility or small hydro facility.  An electric
  2 17 utility is not required to own or purchase, at any one time,
  2 18 more than its share of 105 megawatts of power from alternate
  2 19 energy production facilities or small hydro facilities.
  2 20    The bill modifies the 105 megawatt purchase requirement
  2 21 and limitation to make it applicable strictly to solar energy
  2 22 derived from solar energy facilities in this state.  The 105
  2 23 megawatt solar energy ownership or purchase requirements must
  2 24 be attained by January 1, 2020.  The bill provides that out of
  2 25 this amount, a minimum of 10 percent of the energy produced
  2 26 or purchased shall be produced by or purchased from solar
  2 27 energy facilities with a nameplate generating capacity of
  2 28 20 kilowatts or less. The bill makes conforming changes to
  2 29 related provisions.
