  7 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 34    This bill contains provisions relating to companies
  7 35 that operate motor vehicles and employ drivers for the
  8  1 transportation of railroad workers.
  8  2    Under the bill, the term "employer" means a railroad worker
  8  3 transportation company.  The term "employee" refers to a driver
  8  4 who performs a service for a railroad worker transportation
  8  5 company, either for wages or as an independent contractor.
  8  6    Current law defines "railroad worker transportation company"
  8  7 as a company organized for the purpose of or engaged in the
  8  8 business of transporting, for hire, railroad workers to or from
  8  9 their places of employment or in the course of their employment
  8 10 in motor vehicles designed to carry seven or more persons but
  8 11 fewer than 16 persons including the driver. The bill alters
  8 12 the definition to include motor vehicles designed to carry five
  8 13 or more, but fewer than 16, persons.
  8 14    The bill requires an employer to provide for annual
  8 15 inspection of the employer's motor vehicles by a qualified
  8 16 person.  In addition, each employee who drives a motor vehicle
  8 17 must complete a daily written vehicle report.  An employer is
  8 18 also required to establish a maintenance and repair program
  8 19 that includes weekly inspection of each motor vehicle, with a
  8 20 focus on cleanliness and the condition of vehicle parts and
  8 21 accessories specified in the bill.  An employer is required to
  8 22 maintain records relating to vehicle maintenance and repair for
  8 23 one year, or for a vehicle no longer in the employer's control,
  8 24 for six months.
  8 25    The bill requires an employer to maintain a driver
  8 26 qualification file for each employee that includes specified
  8 27 documentation relating to the employee's driving record
  8 28 and employment record.  The bill states that an employee
  8 29 is disqualified from driving for an employer if the driver
  8 30 is convicted of two or more serious traffic violations
  8 31 committed within three years in Iowa or in any other state.
  8 32 For purposes of the bill, "serious traffic violation" means
  8 33 any violation committed while operating a motor vehicle
  8 34 if the violation resulted in suspension or revocation of
  8 35 the person's drivers license, or the following violations,
  9  1 whether or not the violation resulted in license suspension
  9  2 or revocation:  operating while intoxicated, a seat belt
  9  3 violation, a violation of commercial motor vehicle laws,
  9  4 speeding more than 15 miles per hour over the limit, negligent
  9  5 homicide, using a motor vehicle in commission of a felony,
  9  6 evading arrest, using a motor vehicle to flee law enforcement,
  9  7 careless driving, prohibited passing, unlawfully passing a
  9  8 school bus, failure to obey a traffic control signal or device,
  9  9 driving while suspended, and driving the wrong way on a one=way
  9 10 street.
  9 11    The bill requires drivers to be tested for the presence of
  9 12 alcohol and controlled substances as a condition of employment.
  9 13 In addition, an employer is required to have a driver tested
  9 14 for alcohol and controlled substances following an accident
  9 15 occurring in the course of the driver's employment if the
  9 16 accident involved the death of a person, or if the accident
  9 17 resulted in bodily injury to a person or disabling damage to a
  9 18 motor vehicle and the driver received a citation for a moving
  9 19 violation.  Grounds for disqualification of a driver include
  9 20 a test result indicating an alcohol concentration above zero
  9 21 or a controlled substance test result other than a verified
  9 22 negative; refusing to provide a specimen for testing; or
  9 23 adulteration, dilution, or substitution of a specimen.
  9 24    The bill requires an employer to maintain financial
  9 25 liability coverage in the amount of $1 million per person, up
  9 26 to a maximum of $5 million per motor vehicle owned or operated
  9 27 by the employer and uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage
  9 28 in the amount of $1 million per motor vehicle occupant, up to a
  9 29 maximum of $5 million per motor vehicle.
  9 30    The bill requires an employer to provide the department of
  9 31 transportation with access to the employer's facilities and to
  9 32 records relating to accidents involving the employer's motor
  9 33 vehicles.
  9 34    Pursuant to current law, a violation of the provisions
  9 35 relating to the transportation of railroad workers is
 10  1 punishable by a schedule "one" penalty, which is a fine of
 10  2 $100.  The bill allows an additional civil penalty of up to
 10  3 $2,000 to be imposed for any violation of the provisions of the
 10  4 bill by a railroad company or a railroad worker transportation
 10  5 company.  Each violation of the provisions relating to the
 10  6 transportation of railroad workers constitutes a separate and
 10  7 distinct offense, and for violations of a continuing nature,
 10  8 each day that a violation continues constitutes a separate
 10  9 offense.
