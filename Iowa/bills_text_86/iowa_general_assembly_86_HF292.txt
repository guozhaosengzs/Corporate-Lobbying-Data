  2 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 15    This bill requires certain peace officers and school
  2 16 security personnel to wear a body camera.
  2 17    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  2 18 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  2 19 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  2 20 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  2 21    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  2 23 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  2 24 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  3  3 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  3  4    The bill specifies that the recording created with a body

  3  6 from the date of the recording. The recording shall be
  3  7 retained by the law enforcement agency employing the peace

  3 28 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  3 29 mandate included in the bill.
