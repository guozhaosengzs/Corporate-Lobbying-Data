 11 26                           EXPLANATION
 11 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 29    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 11 30 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section

 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27

 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References

 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by

 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information

 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses

 11 26                           EXPLANATION
 11 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 29    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 11 30 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption

 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.

 11 29    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 11 30 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal

 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.

 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements

 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of

 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This

 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of

 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been

 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 11 26                           EXPLANATION
 11 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 29    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 11 30 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27

 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept

 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the

 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"

 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible

 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain

 11 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 29    This bill relates to the administration of programs by
 11 30 the economic development authority (EDA) by modifying the
 11 31 high quality jobs program and creating a renewable chemical
 11 32 production tax credit program.
 11 33    DIVISION I ==== HIGH QUALITY JOBS PROGRAM.  Division I limits
 11 34 for a period of five or six fiscal years the amount of tax
 11 35 credits that may be allocated to the high quality jobs program,
 12  1 which under current law is subject to EDA's maximum aggregate
 12  2 tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal year in Code section
 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable

 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered

 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility

 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"

 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been

 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions

 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 12  3 15.119.  The bill provides that for each of the five fiscal
 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170

 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 12  4 years beginning on July 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2021,
 12  5 the authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of
 12  6 that $170 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This
 12  7 provision is repealed July 1, 2021.
 12  8    If the aggregate amount of renewable chemical production
 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless

 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,

 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession

 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect

 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 12  9 tax credits awarded by EDA for the fiscal period beginning on
 12 10 July 1, 2018, and ending June 30, 2021, equals or exceeds $27
 12 11 million, then an additional year of high quality jobs program
 12 12 tax credit allocation limitation occurs and for the fiscal
 12 13 year beginning July 1, 2021, and ending June 30, 2022, the
 12 14 authority shall not allocate more than $105 million of its $170
 12 15 million cap to the high quality jobs program.  This provision
 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January

 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to

 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are

 12 16 is repealed July 1, 2022.
 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on

 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions

 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of

 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public

 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References

 12 17    DIVISION II ==== RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT.
 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be

 12 18   Division II creates a renewable chemical production tax credit
 12 19 program (program) that will be administered by the EDA and that
 12 20 will provide tax credits to eligible businesses that produce
 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in
 15 12 calendar year 2022.
 15 13    The tax credit program is repealed July 1, 2030. References
 15 14 to the renewable chemical production tax credit in provisions
 15 15 of the Code relating to the individual and corporate income tax
 15 16 are repealed January 1, 2033.
 15 17    The division takes effect upon enactment and applies to
 15 18 renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from biomass feedstock on
 15 19 or after January 1, 2017.

 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the

 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the

 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of

 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"

 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been

 12 21 renewable chemicals in Iowa from biomass feedstock.  "Renewable
 12 22 chemical", "biomass feedstock", and other related terms are
 12 23 defined in the division.
 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of

 12 24    In order to qualify for the tax credit, a business must
 12 25 meet several requirements.  First, the business must be
 12 26 physically located in Iowa and operated for profit under
 12 27 single management.  Second, the business must not be an
 12 28 entity providing professional services, health care services,
 12 29 or medical treatments, or be engaged primarily in retail
 12 30 operations.  Third, the business must have organized, expanded,
 12 31 or located in Iowa on or after the effective date of the
 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses

 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.

 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered

 12 32 division.  Fourth, the business must not be, in the discretion
 12 33 of the EDA, ineligible under certain provisions relating to the
 12 34 relocation or reduction of business operations within Iowa.
 12 35 Fifth, the business must be in compliance with all agreements
 13  1 entered into under the program or other programs administered
 13  2 by the EDA.
 13  3    An eligible business seeking a tax credit is required to
 13  4 submit an application to the EDA containing various information
 13  5 during the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 13  6 the renewable chemicals are produced. The EDA may accept
 13  7 applications on a continuous basis or may establish an annual
 13  8 application deadline.
 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in

 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable

 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under

 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by

 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of
 14 33 the program for each calendar year and including information
 14 34 specified in the division. Information is required to be
 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
 15  8 and provide any information reasonably required by EDA in order
 15  9 to fulfill this reporting requirement.
 15 10    The division adds the program to the list of tax expenditures
 15 11 to be reviewed by the legislative tax expenditure committee in

 13  9    Before being issued a tax credit, an eligible business
 13 10 is required to enter into an agreement with the EDA for the
 13 11 successful completion of all requirements of the program.  The
 13 12 EDA is authorized to impose two compliance cost fees under the
 13 13 program.  The first fee equals $500 per agreement.  The second
 13 14 fee equals 0.5 percent of the value of the tax credit claimed
 13 15 pursuant to the agreement if the agreement has an aggregate tax
 13 16 credit value of $100,000 or greater.
 13 17    An eligible business that fails to comply with the
 13 18 requirements of the program or the terms of an agreement with
 13 19 the EDA may have its tax credits reduced, terminated, or
 13 20 rescinded, and may be subject to the repayment or recapture of
 13 21 claimed tax credits.
 13 22    The tax credit equals the product of $.05 multiplied by the
 13 23 number of pounds of renewable chemicals produced in Iowa from
 13 24 biomass feedstock by the eligible business during the calendar
 13 25 year in excess of the eligible business's pre=eligibility
 13 26 production threshold. "Pre=eligibility production threshold"
 13 27 is defined in the bill. Renewable chemicals produced by
 13 28 an eligible business either prior to calendar year 2017 or
 13 29 prior to the date the business first qualifies as an eligible
 13 30 business, or after calendar year 2026, shall not qualify for
 13 31 the tax credit.
 13 32    The tax credit shall be claimed for the tax year during which
 13 33 the eligible business was issued the tax credit.  However, tax
 13 34 credits shall not be issued by EDA prior to July 1, 2018, or
 13 35 claimed by the taxpayer prior to September 1, 2018. The tax
 14  1 credit may be claimed against the individual income tax and the
 14  2 corporate income tax.  The credit is refundable or may, at the
 14  3 election of the taxpayer, be carried forward for up to one tax
 14  4 year.   The tax credit shall not be transferred to any person.
 14  5    The division provides that the program is subject to EDA's
 14  6 maximum aggregate tax credit cap of $170 million per fiscal
 14  7 year in Code section 15.119, and not more than $10 million
 14  8 per fiscal year may be issued by the EDA under the program.
 14  9 In addition, the maximum amount of tax credit that may be
 14 10 issued to an eligible business for the production of renewable
 14 11 chemicals in a calendar year shall not exceed $1 million or
 14 12 $500,000, depending on whether the eligible business has been
 14 13 operating in Iowa at the time of application for five or fewer
 14 14 years, or more than five years, respectively.  An eligible
 14 15 business shall not receive more than five tax credits under
 14 16 the program.  The EDA is required to issue tax credits on a
 14 17 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum amount of
 14 18 $10 million per fiscal year is reached.  If the amount of
 14 19 tax credits exceeds this amount in a fiscal year, the EDA
 14 20 is required to establish a wait list and give priority in
 14 21 subsequent years to the eligible businesses on the wait list.
 14 22    The division provides for the confidentiality of certain
 14 23 information under the program.  The identity of a tax credit
 14 24 recipient and the amount of the tax credit shall be considered
 14 25 public information under Code chapter 22 (examination of public
 14 26 records), but any other information or record in the possession
 14 27 of the EDA with respect to the program shall be presumed by
 14 28 the EDA to be a trade secret protected under Code chapter 550
 14 29 or common law and shall be kept confidential by the EDA unless
 14 30 otherwise ordered by a court.
 14 31    The division requires EDA to submit to the general assembly
 14 32 and the governor an annual report describing the activities of

 14 35 reported in an aggregate form to protect the presumption
 15  1 of confidentiality and to prevent, as much as possible,
 15  2 information being attributable to any particular eligible
 15  3 business.  The report for the first calendar year the tax
 15  4 credit is available under the program (2017) is due by January
 15  5 31, 2019, and reports covering subsequent calendar years are
 15  6 due by the same date each year thereafter.  Eligible businesses
 15  7 are required, as part of their agreement with EDA, to collect
