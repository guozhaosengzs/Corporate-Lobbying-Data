  8 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 30    This bill establishes the Iowa electronic communications
  8 31 privacy Act and provides remedies.
  8 32    ELECTRONIC INFORMATION ACCESS BY GOVERNMENT ENTITY.  The
  8 33 bill prohibits a government entity from compelling the
  8 34 production of or access to electronic communication information
  8 35 or electronic device information without a search warrant, a
  9  1 court order, or a subpoena issued under the requirements in
  9  2 the bill.  The bill also prohibits a government entity from
  9  3 accessing electronic device information by means of physical
  9  4 interaction or electronic communication with the electronic
  9  5 device without a search warrant, a court order, or specific
  9  6 consent of the owner or other authorized possessor of the
  9  7 electronic device; but allows access if the government entity,
  9  8 in good faith, believes that an emergency situation exists, or
  9  9 that the electronic device is lost, stolen, or abandoned under
  9 10 certain circumstances.  The bill includes certain definitions
  9 11 including "electronic communication", "electronic communication
  9 12 information", "electronic communication service", "electronic
  9 13 device", and "electronic device information".
  9 14    VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE == SERVICE PROVIDER.  The bill provides
  9 15 that a service provider may voluntarily disclose electronic
  9 16 communication information or subscriber information to a
  9 17 government entity if not otherwise prohibited by state or
  9 18 federal law, and generally requires the government entity
  9 19 to destroy such information within 90 days unless certain
  9 20 circumstances exist.
  9 21    EMERGENCY.  The bill requires a government entity that
  9 22 obtains electronic information pursuant to an emergency
  9 23 involving the risk of death or serious physical harm to a
  9 24 person to file an application with the court for a warrant
  9 25 or order authorizing access to the electronic information
  9 26 or to file a motion with the court seeking approval of the
  9 27 emergency disclosures setting forth the facts giving rise
  9 28 to the emergency.  If a court denies the warrant or order
  9 29 authorizing access to the electronic information, the court is
  9 30 required to order the immediate destruction of all electronic
  9 31 information obtained and shall require the government entity to
  9 32 serve immediate notice under the bill.
  9 33    NOTICE.  The bill requires a government entity that executes
  9 34 a warrant or obtains electronic information in an emergency
  9 35 situation under the bill to serve notice on the identified
 10  1 subject of the warrant or emergency request that informs the
 10  2 subject that information about the subject has been compelled
 10  3 or requested and that states with reasonable specificity
 10  4 the nature of the government investigation under which the
 10  5 information is sought.  The bill provides certain circumstances
 10  6 under which notification of the identified subject of the
 10  7 warrant or emergency request may be delayed.
 10  8    SUBPOENAS.  The bill does not limit the authority of a
 10  9 government entity to use an administrative, grand jury, trial,
 10 10 or civil discovery subpoena under certain circumstances.
 10 11    RELIEF.  The bill provides that an aggrieved person in
 10 12 a trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court,
 10 13 department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other
 10 14 authority of this state, may move to suppress any electronic
 10 15 information obtained or retained by the government entity in
 10 16 violation of either the state or federal constitution and
 10 17 provides that the attorney general may commence a civil action
 10 18 to compel any government entity to comply with the provisions
 10 19 of the bill.
 10 20    REPEAL.  The bill repeals Code chapter 808B, relating to the
 10 21 prohibition, restriction, or authorization of the interception
