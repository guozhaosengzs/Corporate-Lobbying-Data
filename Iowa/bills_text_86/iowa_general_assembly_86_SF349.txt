  9 22    Sec. 9.  APPLICABILITY.  The provisions of this Act are
  9 23 applicable beginning January 1, 2016, and the first filings of
  9 24 corporate governance annual disclosures shall be made pursuant
  9 25 to chapter 521H, as enacted in this Act, in 2016.
  9 26                           EXPLANATION
  9 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 29    This bill creates new Code chapter 521H which requires
  9 30 certain insurers domiciled in the state, or the insurance group
  9 31 of which such an insurer is a member, to file a corporate
  9 32 governance annual disclosure with the commissioner of
  9 33 insurance.  The purpose of the new Code chapter's requirements
  9 34 is to provide the commissioner with a yearly summary of an
  9 35 insurer's or insurance group's governance structure, policies,
 10  1 and practices to permit the commissioner to understand the
 10  2 insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance framework.
 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or
 11  4 control of the insurance division of the department of commerce
 11  5 or any other person pursuant to the bill that is obtained by,
 11  6 created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or to any other
 11  7 person pursuant to the bill, is recognized as being proprietary
 11  8 and containing trade secrets.  Such documents, materials, or
 11  9 other information, including the disclosure, is confidential,
 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.

  9 26                           EXPLANATION
  9 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 29    This bill creates new Code chapter 521H which requires
  9 30 certain insurers domiciled in the state, or the insurance group
  9 31 of which such an insurer is a member, to file a corporate
  9 32 governance annual disclosure with the commissioner of
  9 33 insurance.  The purpose of the new Code chapter's requirements
  9 34 is to provide the commissioner with a yearly summary of an
  9 35 insurer's or insurance group's governance structure, policies,
 10  1 and practices to permit the commissioner to understand the
 10  2 insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance framework.
 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or
 11  4 control of the insurance division of the department of commerce
 11  5 or any other person pursuant to the bill that is obtained by,
 11  6 created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or to any other
 11  7 person pursuant to the bill, is recognized as being proprietary
 11  8 and containing trade secrets.  Such documents, materials, or
 11  9 other information, including the disclosure, is confidential,
 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.

  9 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 29    This bill creates new Code chapter 521H which requires
  9 30 certain insurers domiciled in the state, or the insurance group
  9 31 of which such an insurer is a member, to file a corporate
  9 32 governance annual disclosure with the commissioner of
  9 33 insurance.  The purpose of the new Code chapter's requirements
  9 34 is to provide the commissioner with a yearly summary of an
  9 35 insurer's or insurance group's governance structure, policies,
 10  1 and practices to permit the commissioner to understand the
 10  2 insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance framework.
 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or
 11  4 control of the insurance division of the department of commerce
 11  5 or any other person pursuant to the bill that is obtained by,
 11  6 created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or to any other
 11  7 person pursuant to the bill, is recognized as being proprietary
 11  8 and containing trade secrets.  Such documents, materials, or
 11  9 other information, including the disclosure, is confidential,
 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.
 13 18    New Code chapter 521H is applicable beginning on January 1,
 13 19 2016.

 10  2 insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance framework.
 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or
 11  4 control of the insurance division of the department of commerce
 11  5 or any other person pursuant to the bill that is obtained by,
 11  6 created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or to any other
 11  7 person pursuant to the bill, is recognized as being proprietary
 11  8 and containing trade secrets.  Such documents, materials, or
 11  9 other information, including the disclosure, is confidential,
 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.

 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal

 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.
 13 18    New Code chapter 521H is applicable beginning on January 1,

 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the

 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to

  9 34 is to provide the commissioner with a yearly summary of an
  9 35 insurer's or insurance group's governance structure, policies,
 10  1 and practices to permit the commissioner to understand the
 10  2 insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance framework.
 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or
 11  4 control of the insurance division of the department of commerce
 11  5 or any other person pursuant to the bill that is obtained by,
 11  6 created by, or disclosed to the commissioner or to any other
 11  7 person pursuant to the bill, is recognized as being proprietary
 11  8 and containing trade secrets.  Such documents, materials, or
 11  9 other information, including the disclosure, is confidential,
 11 10 is not subject to Code chapter 22 (open records), shall be
 11 11 considered confidential under Code chapter 507 (examination of
 11 12 insurance companies), shall not be subject to subpoena, and
 11 13 shall not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in
 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with
 12 10 a third=party consultant that governs the sharing and use of
 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each

 11 14 any private civil action.  The commissioner is authorized to
 11 15 use such information in the furtherance of any regulatory or
 11 16 legal action brought as part of the commissioner's official
 11 17 duties.  The commissioner shall not otherwise make such
 11 18 information public without the prior written consent of
 11 19 the insurer or insurance group.  The commissioner or any
 11 20 other person with access to such information shall not be
 11 21 permitted or required to testify in any civil action concerning
 11 22 confidential information.
 11 23    In performing regulatory duties, the commissioner may
 11 24 share confidential and privileged information with specified
 11 25 regulatory and other entities including certain third=party
 11 26 consultants, and may receive such information from specified
 11 27 regulatory and other entities.
 11 28    In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's
 11 29 regulatory duties, the commissioner may retain, at the
 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
 11 32 other experts not otherwise part of the commissioner's staff,
 11 33 as necessary to assist in reviewing a disclosure and related
 11 34 information or ensuring compliance with the requirements of
 11 35 the new Code chapter.  Third=party consultants retained are
 12  1 under the direction and control of the commissioner and act
 12  2 in an advisory capacity only.  Such third=party consultants
 12  3 must verify that they are free of any conflict of interest
 12  4 and that they have internal procedures in place to monitor
 12  5 compliance if there is a conflict and to ensure compliance with
 12  6 the confidentiality standards and requirements of the new Code
 12  7 chapter.
 12  8    A written agreement entered into by the commissioner with
 12  9 the national association of insurance commissioners or with

 12 11 information provided pursuant to new Code chapter 521H shall
 12 12 expressly require the written consent of the insurer prior to
 12 13 making information provided under the new Code chapter public.
 12 14 The agreement must specify that those parties are subject to
 12 15 the same confidentiality standards and requirements governing
 12 16 the sharing and use of information as the commissioner; specify
 12 17 procedures and protocols for the confidentiality and security
 12 18 of information shared and require that the recipient of such
 12 19 information agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
 12 20 and privileged  status of the information and verify the
 12 21 legal authority to do so; specify that ownership of shared
 12 22 information remains with the commissioner, who directs its
 12 23 use; prohibit storage of the information in a permanent
 12 24 database after analysis is complete; require prompt notice to
 12 25 the commissioner and to an insurer or insurance group if the
 12 26 insurer's or insurance group's information is subject to a
 12 27 request or subpoena for disclosure or production; and require
 12 28 that an insurer or insurance group be allowed to intervene in
 12 29 any judicial or administrative action in which the national
 12 30 association of insurance commissioners or a third=party
 12 31 consultant may be required to disclose confidential information
 12 32 that was shared pursuant to the new Code chapter.
 12 33    The sharing of information pursuant to new Code chapter 521H
 12 34 does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority or
 12 35 rulemaking by the commissioner, or a waiver of any applicable
 13  1 privilege or claim of confidentiality.
 13  2    If an insurer or insurance group fails, without just cause
 13  3 to timely file a corporate governance annual disclosure as
 13  4 required in new Code chapter 521H, the commissioner shall,
 13  5 after notice and hearing, impose a penalty of $500 for each
 13  6 day's delay, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 for any single
 13  7 failure to file.  The penalties collected by the commissioner
 13  8 are to be paid to the treasurer of state for deposit in the
 13  9 department of commerce revolving fund as provided in Code
 13 10 section 505.7.  The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the
 13 11 insurer or insurance group demonstrates that imposition of the
 13 12 penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer
 13 13 or insurance group.
 13 14    The provisions of the new Code chapter are severable,
 13 15 with the exception of Code section 521H.6, relating to
 13 16 confidentiality, in the event that application of the Code
 13 17 chapter to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid.

 10  3    Beginning in 2016, an insurer or insurance group is
 10  4 required to submit by June 1, annually, a corporate governance
 10  5 annual disclosure to the commissioner that contains material
 10  6 information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an
 10  7 understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate
 10  8 governance structure, policies, and practices.  The disclosure
 10  9 must be signed by the insurer's or insurance group's chief
 10 10 executive officer or secretary attesting that the corporate
 10 11 practices described in the disclosure have been implemented
 10 12 and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the
 10 13 insurer's or insurance group's board of directors or the
 10 14 appropriate committee of the board. If an insurer is a member
 10 15 of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the disclosure
 10 16 to the commissioner of insurance of the lead state of the
 10 17 insurance group as determined by procedures contained in the
 10 18 financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association
 10 19 of insurance commissioners.
 10 20    For purposes of the disclosure, the insurer or insurance
 10 21 group may report information regarding corporate governance
 10 22 at the ultimate parent controlling level, an intermediate
 10 23 holding company level, or at the individual legal entity
 10 24 level depending on how its system of corporate governance is
 10 25 structured.  The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to
 10 26 make its disclosure at the level at which its risk tolerance
 10 27 is determined; at the level at which its earnings, capital,
 10 28 liquidity, operations, and reputation are overseen collectively
 10 29 and the level at which the supervision of these factors is
 10 30 coordinated and exercised; or at the level at which legal
 10 31 liability for failure of general corporate governance duties
 10 32 would be placed, and to indicate which of these factors
 10 33 were used to determine the level of reporting, including any
 10 34 subsequent changes.
 10 35    The commissioner is directed to adopt rules to administer
 11  1 new Code chapter 521H.
 11  2    Documents, materials, or other information, including a
 11  3 corporate governance annual disclosure, in the possession or

 11 30 insurer's or insurance group's expense, third=party
 11 31 consultants, including attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and
