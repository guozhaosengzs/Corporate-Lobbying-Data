  9  8 various parties under certain conditions.
  9  9    PARTIES TO CONTRACT.  The parties in an innovative financing
  9 10 partnership contract shall consist of one or more providers of

  9 15 that are not seeking a financial return; an independent
  9 16 evaluator; and one or more outcomes payers who agree to pay the
  9 17 investors only if the independent evaluator determines that the
  9 18 prekindergarten services provided under the contract result in
  9 19 the improvements identified.  Outcomes payers may also include
  9 20 any governmental entity, including but not limited to a school
  9 21 district, or any private entity who agrees to commit to pay

  9 26    CONTRACT PROPOSAL CRITERIA.  DAS must evaluate contract
  9 27 proposals based on the expected outcomes, which must be
  9 28 budget=neutral or better, after accounting for projected cost

  9 30 that have both a positive fiscal impact on governments and
  9 31 are strongly supported by a given historical model; payment
  9 32 conditioned on achievement of specific outcomes; an objective
  9 33 process to be used by an independent evaluator to determine
  9 34 whether performance targets have been achieved; a schedule of
  9 35 payments, including a return on investment calculation and a
 10  1 calculation of the amounts of payments earned; a determination
 10  2 by DAS, in collaboration with the department of education, that
 10  3 the contract proposal will result in significant performance
 10  4 improvements and budgetary savings, and that the savings will
 10  5 exceed the debt service requirements of any notes issued by the
 10  6 treasurer of state, and a clear description of the programming
 10  7 that will be provided by the service provider.
 10  8    ADDITIONAL WEIGHTING.  DAS may assign additional weight to
