  3  4    Currently, the rate of the excise tax on a gallon of motor
  3  5 fuel is linked to the distribution percentage of ethanol
  3  6 blended gasoline and fuel other than ethanol blended gasoline
  3  7 sold in this state, and beginning July 1, 2015, the tax rate
  3  8 for both ethanol blended gasoline and motor fuel other than
  3  9 ethanol blended gasoline will be 20 cents per gallon. The
  3 10 current rate of the excise tax on special fuel for diesel
  3 11 engines of motor vehicles is 22.5 cents per gallon.
  3 12    This bill replaces the current per=gallon tax rates on motor
  3 13 fuel and special fuel for diesel engines of motor vehicles with
  3 14 tax rates expressed as a percentage of the sales price.
  3 15    The new motor fuel tax rate established in the bill will
  3 16 be a percentage of the wholesale price of a gallon of motor
  3 17 fuel that represents an amount per gallon that is equivalent
  3 18 to the amount of revenue produced by the current tax rate of 20
  3 19 cents per gallon, rounded to the nearest one=half of 1 percent.
  3 20 The new rate will be established on the effective date of the

  3 25 fuel is also the rate for special fuel that is not for diesel
  3 26 engines of motor vehicles or for aircraft, and under specified
  3 27 circumstances, the rate determined under the bill for motor
  3 28 fuel may also be the rate for E=85 gasoline.
  3 29    The new tax rate for special fuel for diesel engines of motor
  3 30 vehicles will be established on the effective date of the Act
  3 31 in the same manner as the tax rate for motor fuel.  The rate is
  3 32 a percentage of the wholesale price of a gallon of diesel fuel
  3 33 that represents an amount equivalent to the amount of revenue
  3 34 produced by the current tax rate of 22.5 cents per gallon,
  3 35 rounded to the nearest one=half of 1 percent.  The wholesale
