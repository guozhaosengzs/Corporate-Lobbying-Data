  4 14                           EXPLANATION
  4 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 17    This bill allows a physician, or a physician jointly with a
  4 18 health facility, to engage in an open, confidential discussion
  4 19 with a patient related to an adverse health care incident.
  4 20    The bill defines "adverse health care incident" as an
  4 21 objective, definable, and unanticipated consequence of a
  4 22 medical treatment or procedure which differs from the intended
  4 23 outcome and results in the death or serious physical injury of
  4 24 a patient. The bill defines "physician" as a person licensed
  4 25 under Code chapter 148 (medicine and surgery and osteopathic
  4 26 medicine and surgery). The bill defines "patient" as a
  4 27 person who receives medical care from a physician, or if the
  4 28 person is a minor, deceased, or incapacitated, the person's
  4 29 legal representative. The bill defines "health facility" as
  4 30 an institutional health facility as defined in Code section
  4 31 135.61, a hospice licensed under Code chapter 135J, home health
  4 32 agency as defined in Code section 144D.1, clinic, or community
  4 33 health center, and includes any corporation, professional
  4 34 corporation, partnership, limited liability company, limited
  4 35 liability partnership, or other entity comprised of such

  5  5 notice of an offer to engage in an open discussion must be
  5  6 sent to the patient within 180 days after the adverse health
  5  7 care incident. If the patient agrees to proceed with an open
  5  8 discussion, the physician or health facility may investigate
  5  9 the adverse health care incident, disclose the results to the
  5 10 patient, and discuss steps the physician or health facility
  5 11 will take to prevent similar adverse health care incidents.
  5 12 The physician or health facility may also communicate to the
  5 13 patient that either the physician or health facility has
  5 14 determined that an offer of compensation is not warranted
  5 15 or that an offer of compensation is warranted. An offer of
  5 16 compensation may be conditioned upon the patient executing
  5 17 a release of future liability as to the adverse health care
  5 18 incident. All communications made under the Code chapter are
  5 19 privileged and confidential, are not subject to discovery,
  5 20 subpoena, or other means of legal compulsion for release, and
  5 21 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  5 22 or arbitration proceeding.
  5 23    The bill provides that a payment made under the Code chapter
  5 24 is not a written claim or demand for payment, a claim that must
  5 25 be submitted to a licensing board under Code section 272C.9, or
  5 26 a medical malpractice insurance claim that must be reported to
  5 27 the commissioner of insurance under Code section 505.27.
