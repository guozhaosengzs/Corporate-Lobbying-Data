  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount

  4 24    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  4 25 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  4 26 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  4 27 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  4 28 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  4 29 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  4 30 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  4 31 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  4 32 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  4 33 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  4 34    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  4 35 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,

  5  2 in the vulnerable elder.
  5  3    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  5 18 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  5 19 older individual involved.

  4 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 24    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  4 25 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  4 26 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  4 27 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  4 28 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  4 29 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  4 30 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  4 31 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  4 32 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  4 33 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  4 34    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  4 35 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,

  5  3    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  5 18 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  5 19 older individual involved.

  4 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 24    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  4 25 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  4 26 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  4 27 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  4 28 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  4 29 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  4 30 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  4 31 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  4 32 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  4 33 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  4 34    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  4 35 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  5  1 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  5  2 in the vulnerable elder.
  5  3    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  5 18 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  5 19 older individual involved.

  3 12 criminal liability on a person who has made a good=faith effort
  3 13 to assist an older individual in the management of the older
  3 14 individual's benefits, property, resources, belongings, or
  3 15 assets, but through no fault of the person, the person has been
  3 16 unable to provide such assistance.
  3 17    6.  It shall not be a defense to financial exploitation of

  4 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 24    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  4 25 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  4 26 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  4 27 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  4 28 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  4 29 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  4 30 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  4 31 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  4 32 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  4 33 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  4 34    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  4 35 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  5  1 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  5  2 in the vulnerable elder.
  5  3    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount

  4 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 24    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  4 25 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  4 26 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  4 27 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  4 28 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  4 29 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  4 30 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  4 31 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  4 32 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  4 33 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  4 34    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  4 35 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  5  1 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  5  2 in the vulnerable elder.
  5  3    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  5  4 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  5  5 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  5  6 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  5  7 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  5  8 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  5  9    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  5 10 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  5 11 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  5 12 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  5 13 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  5 14 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  5 15 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  5 16 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  5 17 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  5 18 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  5 19 older individual involved.
