BACKGROUND.
A
limited
partnership
and
a
limited
liability
18


company
are
unincorporated
entities
that
are
organized
19


(“formed”),
operate,
may
have
perpetual
duration,
and
provide
20


a
measure
of
protection
from
liability
to
its
investors
under
21


state
law.
In
order
to
form
either
type
of
entity
in
this
22


state,
an
organic
document
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
23


of
state.
In
the
case
of
a
limited
partnership,
the
document
24


is
referred
to
as
a
certificate
of
limited
partnership
and
25


in
the
case
of
a
limited
liability
company,
it
is
referred
26


to
as
a
certificate
of
organization
(Code
sections
488.201
27


and
489.201).
The
secretary
of
state
issues
a
certificate
28


of
good
standing
to
each
type
of
entity.
For
a
“domestic”
29


entity
formed
under
Iowa
law,
the
document
is
referred
to
30


as
a
certificate
of
existence
and
for
a
“foreign”
entity
31


formed
under
another
jurisdiction’s
law,
it
is
referred
to
32


as
a
certificate
of
authorization
(Code
sections
488.209
and
33


489.208).
