 16 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 30    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of provisions
 16 31 administered by the department of agriculture and land
 16 32 stewardship (DALS).
 16 33    HORSE RACING ==== ELIMINATION PAST DATES APPLICABLE TO
 16 34 IOWA=FOALED HORSES.  The bill eliminates past dates (either
 16 35 referring to before or after January 1, 1985) setting
 17  1 forth requirements to determine when a horse is eligible to
 17  2 participate in an annual race reserved for Iowa=foaled breeds
 17  3 (Code chapter 99D).
 17  4    EXAMINATION OF CERTAIN ARTICLES ==== ELIMINATION OF CONTINGENT
 17  5 FUND.  The bill eliminates a "contingent fund" dedicated for
 17  6 use by DALS to pay costs associated with the examination of
 17  7 certain articles, including food, commercial feed, agricultural
 17  8 seed, commercial fertilizer, drugs, pesticide, and paint (Code
 17  9 chapter 189).
 17 10    MILK REGULATION ==== FEDERAL PUBLICATIONS.  The bill allows
 17 11 DALS to adopt by rule a number of federal publications as
 17 12 defined in the bill, including adopting by reference, that
 17 13 relate to the regulation of milk and milk products (Code
 17 14 chapter 192).
 17 15    ELIMINATION OF SEED LABORATORY.  The bill eliminates DALS'
 17 16 seed laboratory which is used to enforce regulations relating
 17 17 to the sale of agricultural and vegetable seed.  The bill does
 17 18 not affect duties performed by the Iowa state university seed
 17 19 laboratory but changes its name to the Iowa state university
 17 20 seed testing laboratory (Code chapter 199).
 17 21    GRAIN DEPOSITORS AND SELLERS INDEMNITY FUND ==== FEES.  The
 17 22 bill excludes certain transactions from the classification
 17 23 of "purchased grain" which is assessed a per=bushel fee
 17 24 paid by grain dealers into the grain depositors and sellers
 17 25 indemnity fund (Code chapter 203D).   The fee would not apply
 17 26 to a cancellation of a collateral warehouse receipt or an
 17 27 intra=company location transfer (Code chapter 206), if so
 17 28 entered into the grain dealer's accounts.  It also changes the
 17 29 period when the department calculates whether assets in the
 17 30 fund exceed $8,000,000 which suspends the imposition of fees
 17 31 paid into the fund.  The bill changes the period from the end of
 17 32 each three=month period to the end of the fund's fiscal year
 17 33 (June 30).
 17 34    CHLORDANE PROHIBITION ==== ELIMINATION OF A DATE.  The bill
 17 35 amends the "Pesticide Act of Iowa" by eliminating a past date
 18  1 (January 1, 1989) after which chlordane could not be sold in
 18  2 this state (Code chapter 206).
 18  3    COAL MINING REGULATIONS ==== ELIMINATION OF A TERM AND DATE.
 18  4  The bill eliminates the term "general welfare" when referring
 18  5 to the rehabilitation and conservation of land affected by coal
 18  6 mining (Code chapter 207).  It also eliminates a reference to
 18  7 a past date (May 2, 1977) regarding liens filed against such
 18  8 property.  DALS is prevented from filing a lien against the
 18  9 private land of a person who owned the land's surface prior
 18 10 to that date to pay costs associated with rehabilitating or
 18 11 conserving such land.
 18 12    EXPANSION OF DEFINITION ==== BIOBUTANOL.  The bill modifies
 18 13 the definition of biobutanol to include n=butyl which is an
 18 14 alcohol used to blend with gasoline.
 18 15    INSPECTIONS OF CERTAIN TEST WEIGHTS ==== APPROVAL OF PRIVATE
 18 16 LABORATORIES AND FEES.  The bill provides that DALS no longer
 18 17 verifies test weights used by persons engaged in scale repair
 18 18 work (Code chapter 215).  Instead, DALS is required to approve
 18 19 a private laboratory that performs that function.  The bill
 18 20 also eliminates associated fees.
 18 21    DIVISION OF SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY.  The
 18 22 bill amends Code section 159.5 to change the name of DALS'
 18 23 division of soil conservation to the division of soil
 18 24 conservation and water quality. The bill makes a number of
 18 25 conforming amendments to Code chapters that refer to the
 18 26 division.  Finally, the bill changes the name of the division's
 18 27 administrator to director.
