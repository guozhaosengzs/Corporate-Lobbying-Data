  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill makes changes to the campaign finance laws
  4  1 relating to independent expenditures.
  4  2    The bill provides that a person who makes independent
  4  3 expenditures and files all required statements is not required
  4  4 to organize a committee or file a statement of organization.
  4  5    The bill strikes language that required persons making
  4  6 independent expenditures to file a termination report following
  4  7 a determination that the person will no longer make such
  4  8 expenditures. The bill also states that a person who makes
  4  9 an independent expenditure shall not be required to file a
  4 10 statement of dissolution if the person files all other required
  4 11 statements.
  4 12    The bill strikes the requirement that a person making
  4 13 an independent expenditure file the same disclosure report
  4 14 required of candidates.
  4 15    The bill requires that an officer representing a person,
  4 16 other than one or more individuals, certify the prior
  4 17 authorization for the independent expenditure from the person's
  4 18 governing or leadership body. The statute currently requires
  4 19 only a corporation to certify prior authorization.
  4 20    The bill requires that the name and address of every
  4 21 contributor of $25 or more, or source of funding that provided
  4 22 anything equal to or greater than $25 in value, for purposes
  4 23 of furthering an independent expenditure be included on the
  4 24 independent expenditure statement but maintains current Code
  4 25 language that provides that the identification of individual
  4 26 members who pay dues to a labor union, organization, or
  4 27 association, or individual stockholders of a business
  4 28 corporation is not required.
  4 29    As provided in Code section 68A.701, a willful violation of
  4 30 any provision of the campaign finance Code chapter is a serious
  4 31 misdemeanor punishable by confinement for up to one year and
  4 32 a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  A variety
  4 33 of civil remedies are also available in Code section 68B.32D
  4 34 for a violation of Code chapter 68A or rules of the ethics and
  4 35 campaign disclosure board, ranging from a reprimand to a civil
  5  1 penalty of not more than $2,000.
