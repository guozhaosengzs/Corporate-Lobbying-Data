  1  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  7    Current law requires that the state board of education
  1  8 provide in rule for a set of core academic indicators in
  1  9 mathematics and reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science

  1 11 school districts in the school year beginning July 1, 2011, be
  1 12 used for this purpose.
  1 13    This bill strikes a requirement that the state board's rules
  1 14 provide that for the school year beginning July 1, 2016, and
  1 15 each succeeding school year, all students enrolled in school
  1 16 districts in grades 3 through 11 shall be administered an
  1 17 assessment during the last quarter of the school year that
  1 18 assesses student progress on the core academic indicators.
  1 19 The provision also requires that the assessment used after
  1 20 July 1, 2016, at a minimum be aligned with the Iowa common
  1 21 core standards in both content and rigor; accurately describe

  1 24 valid, reliable, and fair measures of student progress toward
  1 25 college or career readiness.
  1 26    The bill also strikes a Code provision that requires the

  1  7    Current law requires that the state board of education

  1 11 school districts in the school year beginning July 1, 2011, be
  1 12 used for this purpose.
  1 13    This bill strikes a requirement that the state board's rules
  1 14 provide that for the school year beginning July 1, 2016, and
  1 15 each succeeding school year, all students enrolled in school

  1 23 school district, and state accountability systems; and provide
  1 24 valid, reliable, and fair measures of student progress toward
  1 25 college or career readiness.
  1 26    The bill also strikes a Code provision that requires the
