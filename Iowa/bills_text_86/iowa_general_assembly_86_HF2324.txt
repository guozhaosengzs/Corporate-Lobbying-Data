  1  6 computer science course by the school year beginning July 1,

  1 10 recommendations shall also include but not be limited to the
  1 11 following:
  1 12    a.  Standards for one or more high=quality computer science
  1 13 courses, with one or more models for such courses to be
  1 14 developed by the department by July 1, 2017.
  1 15    b.  A recommendation as to whether one or more such
  1 16 high=quality computer science courses could be integrated into
  1 17 a career and technical education pathway.
  1 18    c.  A recommendation as to how one or more such high=quality
  1 19 computer science courses could satisfy the high school
  1 20 graduation requirement for mathematics.
  1 21    d.  Multiple settings for the delivery of high=quality high
  1 22 school computer science courses, including traditional high
  1 23 school classes, concurrent enrollment classes, and online
  1 24 learning classes that include the opportunity for students to
  1 25 collaborate within a classroom setting.
  1 26    e.  Guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  1 27 twelve career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  1 28 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  1 29 instruction, which would include a unit on coding in seventh
  1 30 or eighth grade to be required by the school year beginning on
  1 31 July 1, 2018, pursuant to section 256.11, subsection 4.
  1 32    f.  Licensure and professional development requirements to
  1 33 ensure that teachers are prepared for and supported in the
  1 34 delivery of high=quality computer science courses.
  1 35    g.  An estimate of the cost of implementation of requirements
  2  1 described in this section that, by the school year beginning
  2  2 July 1, 2018, one unit of high=quality computer science
  2  3 education be added to the minimum educational program to be
