  5 23                           EXPLANATION
  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    This bill relates to the mechanism by which minors or persons
  5 27 of unsound mind, or their legal representatives, who own real
  5 28 estate which was sold at a tax sale may redeem such parcels.
  5 29    The bill defines "legal representative" as a parent,
  5 30 guardian, or conservator of a person with a legal disability, a
  5 31 person appointed by a court to act on behalf of a person with a
  5 32 legal disability, or a person acting on behalf of a person with
  5 33 a legal disability pursuant to a power of attorney. The bill
  5 34 defines "person with a legal disability" as a minor or a person
  5 35 of unsound mind.
  6  1 Under current law, if a person with a legal disability is the
  6  2 owner of a parcel that is sold at a tax sale and the treasurer's
  6  3 deed has been delivered, the person with a legal disability
  6  4 may redeem the parcel at any time within one year after the
  6  5 disability is removed, in the manner specified in Code section
  6  6 447.8. Code section 447.8 specifies the manner of redemption
  6  7 by an owner who alleges a failure by the holder of the tax title
  6  8 to serve the parcel owner with notice of the tax sale and the
  6  9 parcel owner's redemption rights.
  6 10    The bill specifies the procedure by which a person with
  6 11 a legal disability can redeem a parcel sold at a tax sale
  6 12 after the delivery of the treasurer's deed. Before delivery
  6 13 of the treasurer's deed, the bill provides that the person
  6 14 with a legal disability or the person's legal representative
  6 15 may redeem under Code sections 447.1 and 447.3, which is the
  6 16 same as current law. After delivery of the treasurer's deed,
  6 17 the person with a legal disability or the person's legal
  6 18 representative must bring an equitable action for redemption in
  6 19 the district court of the county where the parcel is located
  6 20 and prove to the court that prior to the delivery of the
  6 21 treasurer's deed, the person with a legal disability or the
  6 22 person's legal representative was entitled to redeem by virtue
  6 23 of such disability. All persons claiming an interest in the
  6 24 parcel from the tax sale must be named as defendants. If the
  6 25 court determines that the person with a legal disability or the
  6 26 person's legal representative is entitled to redeem, the court
  6 27 will determine the rights, claims, and interests of all of the
  6 28 parties, and will establish the amount necessary to effect
  6 29 redemption. The person with a legal disability or the person's
  6 30 legal representative has 30 days after the date of the order
  6 31 to pay the redemption amount. Upon timely receipt of payment,
  6 32 the court shall declare the treasurer's deed to be invalid.
  6 33 If the person with a legal disability or the person's legal
  6 34 representative fails to timely deliver payment, such person's
  6 35 redemption rights are terminated.
  7  1 The action may be brought until one year after the disability
  7  2 is removed unless otherwise barred. The bill bars bringing
  7  3 the action if the person with a legal disability remained in
  7  4 possession of the parcel, the person claiming under the tax
  7  5 title properly commenced an action to remove the person with
  7  6 a legal disability, and the person with a legal disability
  7  7 or the person's legal representative fails to timely file
  7  8 a counterclaim or separate action asserting the right of
  7  9 redemption. The bill also bars the action if the person with
  7 10 a legal disability is not in possession of the parcel and the
  7 11 action is barred by Code section 448.16. Code section 448.16
  7 12 bars actions where the person claiming under tax title records
  7 13 an affidavit with the county recorder of the county where the
  7 14 parcel is located and a person with redemption rights fails to
  7 15 file a claim within 120 days after the filing of the affidavit.
  7 16 Finally, the bill bars the action if it is not filed within
  7 17 three years of the recording of the treasurer's deed.

  5 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 26    This bill relates to the mechanism by which minors or persons
  5 27 of unsound mind, or their legal representatives, who own real
  5 28 estate which was sold at a tax sale may redeem such parcels.
  5 29    The bill defines "legal representative" as a parent,
  5 30 guardian, or conservator of a person with a legal disability, a
  5 31 person appointed by a court to act on behalf of a person with a
  5 32 legal disability, or a person acting on behalf of a person with
  5 33 a legal disability pursuant to a power of attorney. The bill
  5 34 defines "person with a legal disability" as a minor or a person
  5 35 of unsound mind.
  6  1 Under current law, if a person with a legal disability is the
  6  2 owner of a parcel that is sold at a tax sale and the treasurer's
  6  3 deed has been delivered, the person with a legal disability
  6  4 may redeem the parcel at any time within one year after the
  6  5 disability is removed, in the manner specified in Code section
  6  6 447.8. Code section 447.8 specifies the manner of redemption
  6  7 by an owner who alleges a failure by the holder of the tax title
  6  8 to serve the parcel owner with notice of the tax sale and the
  6  9 parcel owner's redemption rights.
  6 10    The bill specifies the procedure by which a person with
  6 11 a legal disability can redeem a parcel sold at a tax sale
  6 12 after the delivery of the treasurer's deed. Before delivery
  6 13 of the treasurer's deed, the bill provides that the person
  6 14 with a legal disability or the person's legal representative
  6 15 may redeem under Code sections 447.1 and 447.3, which is the
  6 16 same as current law. After delivery of the treasurer's deed,
  6 17 the person with a legal disability or the person's legal
  6 18 representative must bring an equitable action for redemption in
  6 19 the district court of the county where the parcel is located
  6 20 and prove to the court that prior to the delivery of the
  6 21 treasurer's deed, the person with a legal disability or the
  6 22 person's legal representative was entitled to redeem by virtue
  6 23 of such disability. All persons claiming an interest in the
  6 24 parcel from the tax sale must be named as defendants. If the
  6 25 court determines that the person with a legal disability or the
  6 26 person's legal representative is entitled to redeem, the court
  6 27 will determine the rights, claims, and interests of all of the
  6 28 parties, and will establish the amount necessary to effect
  6 29 redemption. The person with a legal disability or the person's
  6 30 legal representative has 30 days after the date of the order
  6 31 to pay the redemption amount. Upon timely receipt of payment,
  6 32 the court shall declare the treasurer's deed to be invalid.
  6 33 If the person with a legal disability or the person's legal
