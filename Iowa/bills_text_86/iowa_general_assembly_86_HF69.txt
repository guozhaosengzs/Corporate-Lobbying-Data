  2 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 29    This bill modifies earned time for persons who kidnap a minor
  2 30 and are required to register as a sex offender.
  2 31    Under current law there are two sentence categories relating
  2 32 to the accrual of earned time.  An inmate serving a category
  2 33 "A" sentence is eligible for a reduction of sentence equal to
  2 34 one and two=tenths days for each day the inmate demonstrates
  2 35 good conduct and satisfactorily participates in any program or
  3  1 placement status identified by the director of the department

  3  3 category "B" sentence under current law is eligible for a
  3  4 reduction of sentence equal to fifteen eighty=fifths of a day
  3  5 for each day of good conduct by the inmate.
  3  6    The bill creates a category "C" sentence for the accrual
  3  7 of earned time by eliminating the ability of an inmate to
  3  8 accumulate earned time if convicted of kidnapping as defined in
  3  9 Code section 710.1, involving a minor, that requires the person
  3 10 to register as a sex offender under Code chapter 692A.
  3 11    Under the bill, if a person is sentenced to serve both
  3 12 a category "C" sentence and another category sentence, the
  3 13 category "C" sentence shall be served before the other category
  3 14 sentence is served, and no earned time shall accrue until the
  3 15 category "C" sentence has been served. The bill also provides
  3 16 that if an inmate serving another category sentence besides
  3 17 a category "C" sentence is sentenced to serve a category "C"
  3 18 sentence, the sentence of the other category sentence shall be
  3 19 interrupted, and no further earned time shall accrue against
