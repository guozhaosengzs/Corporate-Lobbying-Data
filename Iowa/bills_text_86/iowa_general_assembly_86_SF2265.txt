  6 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 30    This bill relates to the juror selection process, eliminates
  6 31 the use of jury commissions to draw juror lists, and requires
  6 32 the master jury list to be updated using an electronic data
  6 33 processing system annually.
  6 34    Under current law, counties may use jury commissions or a
  6 35 jury manager to draw up a master jury list of eligible jurors,
  7  1 return a list of grand jurors and petit jurors to the clerk of
  7  2 district court, and select the number of required jurors from
  7  3 the grand juror or petit juror list.
  7  4    For counties that use jury commissions, an appointive jury
  7  5 commission is appointed for the county by the chief judge of
  7  6 the judicial district in which the county is located and is
  7  7 responsible for drawing up the master jury list of potential
  7  8 jurors, as well as a list of potential grand jurors and petit
  7  9 jurors. An ex officio jury commission, comprised of the clerk
  7 10 of the district court and the county auditor, then randomly
  7 11 selects the names from the grand juror list and petit juror
  7 12 list to draw the required number of jurors for a pool or panel.
  7 13    Counties, however, are not required to appoint jury
  7 14 commissions, and may instead use jury managers.  The jury
  7 15 manager for the county is appointed by the chief judge of the
  7 16 judicial district, after consultation with the clerk of court,
  7 17 district court administrator, and county auditor. The jury
  7 18 manager draws up the master jury list, draws up the lists of
  7 19 grand jurors and petit jurors, and randomly selects the names
  7 20 from the grand juror list and petit juror list to draw the
  7 21 required number of jurors for a pool or panel.
  7 22    The bill eliminates jury commissions. As a result, counties
  7 23 will be required to use jury managers to draw master jury lists
  7 24 and select jurors. The bill also requires that an electronic
  7 25 data processing system be used to create a master jury list and
  7 26 for the random drawing of jurors.
  7 27    Under current law, the master jury list must be updated once
  7 28 every two years. The master jury list is the list of names
  7 29 taken from all source lists, including the voter registration
  7 30 list and the motor vehicle operators list, for possible jury
  7 31 service. The bill requires that the master jury list be
  7 32 updated every year, and that the master jury list include the
  7 33 nonoperators identification list.
  7 34    The bill provides that jury managers and the state court
  7 35 administrator are responsible for implementing the provisions
  8  1 of the bill.
