  1 28    1.  If a holder of land affirmatively pleads as a defense
  1 29 to a cause of action that there is a limitation of liability

  2  6    Sec. 5.    2  6    Sec. 5.    2  7    1.  The court may, at any time during the course of
  2  8 litigation of a cause of action, upon motion or on the court's
  2  9 own initiative, determine that the subject matter of the cause

  2 11 that there is no claim upon which relief can be granted.  Upon
  2 12 making such a determination, the case shall be dismissed with a
  2 13 statement from the court stating the reasons for the dismissal.
  2 14    2.  If a case is dismissed as provided in subsection 1, the
  2 15 court shall also make a timely finding of whether the cause
  2 16 of action was brought for frivolous, malicious, willful, or
  2 17 groundless reasons or purposes.  If such a finding is made, the
  2 18 court shall do both of the following:
  2 19    a.  Award the defendant reasonable costs of litigation,
  2 20 including attorney fees.
  2 21    b.  Charge the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney with
  2 22 any other penalty that may be charged upon such a finding, as
  2 23 prescribed by the laws of this state.
  2 24                           EXPLANATION
  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    This bill relates to litigation involving the public use
  2 28 of private lands and waters.  Code chapter 461C limits the
  2 29 liability of certain holders of private lands and waters
  2 30 to members of the public who enter onto such lands for
  2 31 recreational purposes and for urban deer control.  The bill
  2 32 amends Code chapter 461C to define "educational activities"
  2 33 that are included as recreational purposes under current Code
  2 34 chapter 461C.
  2 35    The bill requires a cause of action which may involve a
  3  1 defense that liability is limited under Code chapter 461C
  3  2 to affirmatively plead that the chapter is not applicable.
  3  3 The bill also requires the answer to such a cause of action
  3  4 to affirmatively plead as a defense that the chapter is
  3  5 applicable.
  3  6    The bill requires that a cause of action which may be
  3  7 limited by Code chapter 461C must join all holders of the land
  3  8 on which the cause of action is alleged to have arisen.  If
  3  9 the plaintiff does not include the required joinder of such
  3 10 defendants, the court may dismiss the action or join the
  3 11 required holders and assess the costs of that joinder to the
  3 12 plaintiff.
  3 13    The bill provides that if a holder of land affirmatively
  3 14 pleads as a defense that the plaintiff's liability is limited
  3 15 under Code chapter 461C, there is a presumption that this
  3 16 limitation is applicable.  The burden of proof is on the
  3 17 plaintiff to rebut this presumption based on clear and
  3 18 convincing evidence.  The fact that a holder of land has an
  3 19 insurance policy on the land protecting the holder against
  3 20 liability to persons engaging in recreational activities and
  3 21 urban deer control on that land is not evidence that Code
  3 22 chapter 461C is not applicable and cannot be introduced as
  3 23 evidence of control over the land.
  3 24    The bill provides that a court may determine at any time
  3 25 during litigation of a cause of action that Code chapter 461C
  3 26 applies and that there is no claim upon which relief can be
  3 27 granted and may dismiss the case.  If the case is dismissed,
  3 28 the court must make a timely finding of whether the case
  3 29 was brought for frivolous, malicious, willful, or groundless
  3 30 reasons or purposes.  If so, the court shall award the
  3 31 defendant reasonable costs of litigation, including attorney
  3 32 fees, and charge the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney with
  3 33 any other penalty prescribed by law that may be charged upon
  3 34 such a finding.

  3  3 The bill also requires the answer to such a cause of action
  3  4 to affirmatively plead as a defense that the chapter is

  3  6    The bill requires that a cause of action which may be

  3 10 defendants, the court may dismiss the action or join the

  3 12 plaintiff.
  3 13    The bill provides that if a holder of land affirmatively

  3 15 under Code chapter 461C, there is a presumption that this
  3 16 limitation is applicable.  The burden of proof is on the

  2 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 27    This bill relates to litigation involving the public use
  2 28 of private lands and waters.  Code chapter 461C limits the
  2 29 liability of certain holders of private lands and waters
  2 30 to members of the public who enter onto such lands for
  2 31 recreational purposes and for urban deer control.  The bill
  2 32 amends Code chapter 461C to define "educational activities"
  2 33 that are included as recreational purposes under current Code
  2 34 chapter 461C.
  2 35    The bill requires a cause of action which may involve a
  3  1 defense that liability is limited under Code chapter 461C
  3  2 to affirmatively plead that the chapter is not applicable.
  3  3 The bill also requires the answer to such a cause of action
  3  4 to affirmatively plead as a defense that the chapter is
  3  5 applicable.
  3  6    The bill requires that a cause of action which may be
  3  7 limited by Code chapter 461C must join all holders of the land
  3  8 on which the cause of action is alleged to have arisen.  If
  3  9 the plaintiff does not include the required joinder of such
  3 10 defendants, the court may dismiss the action or join the
  3 11 required holders and assess the costs of that joinder to the
  3 12 plaintiff.
  3 13    The bill provides that if a holder of land affirmatively
  3 14 pleads as a defense that the plaintiff's liability is limited
  3 15 under Code chapter 461C, there is a presumption that this
  3 16 limitation is applicable.  The burden of proof is on the
  3 17 plaintiff to rebut this presumption based on clear and
  3 18 convincing evidence.  The fact that a holder of land has an
