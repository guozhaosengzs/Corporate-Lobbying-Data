  3  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 10    Currently, Code section 321.276 prohibits the use of a
  3 11 hand=held electronic communication device to write, send, or
  3 12 read a text message while driving a motor vehicle. This bill
  3 13 expands that provision to prohibit any use of a hand=held
  3 14 electronic communication device while driving. A hand=held
  3 15 electronic communication device is a device used to compose,
  3 16 send, receive, or read any electronic message, including
  3 17 telephone calls, video calls, electronic mail, text messages,
  3 18 instant messages, and commands or requests to access an
  3 19 internet site. However, the bill does not alter the exceptions
  3 20 existing under current law, including the use of hands=free
  3 21 devices and global positioning systems while driving. The
  3 22 bill eliminates the provision prohibiting a peace officer from
  3 23 stopping or detaining a person solely for a violation of Code
  3 24 section 321.276.
  3 25    The bill rewords the applicable scheduled fine provision
  3 26 to comply with the bill. The scheduled fine for a violation
  3 27 of Code section 321.276 remains $30. Under current law, the
  3 28 offense is not a moving violation, and therefore cannot be
  3 29 considered for purposes of administrative suspension of a
  3 30 driver's license or to establish habitual offender status.
  3 31 However, under Code section 321.482A, if the violation causes a
  3 32 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  3 33 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  3 34 days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
  3 35 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  4  1 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.

  3  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 10    Currently, Code section 321.276 prohibits the use of a
  3 11 hand=held electronic communication device to write, send, or
  3 12 read a text message while driving a motor vehicle. This bill
  3 13 expands that provision to prohibit any use of a hand=held
  3 14 electronic communication device while driving. A hand=held
  3 15 electronic communication device is a device used to compose,
  3 16 send, receive, or read any electronic message, including
  3 17 telephone calls, video calls, electronic mail, text messages,
  3 18 instant messages, and commands or requests to access an
  3 19 internet site. However, the bill does not alter the exceptions
  3 20 existing under current law, including the use of hands=free
  3 21 devices and global positioning systems while driving. The
  3 22 bill eliminates the provision prohibiting a peace officer from
  3 23 stopping or detaining a person solely for a violation of Code
  3 24 section 321.276.
  3 25    The bill rewords the applicable scheduled fine provision
  3 26 to comply with the bill. The scheduled fine for a violation
  3 27 of Code section 321.276 remains $30. Under current law, the
  3 28 offense is not a moving violation, and therefore cannot be
  3 29 considered for purposes of administrative suspension of a
  3 30 driver's license or to establish habitual offender status.
  3 31 However, under Code section 321.482A, if the violation causes a
  3 32 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  3 33 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  3 34 days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
  3 35 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  4  1 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
