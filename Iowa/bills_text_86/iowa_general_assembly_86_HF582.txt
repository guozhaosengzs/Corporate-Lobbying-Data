 13  3                           EXPLANATION
 13  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  6    This bill relates to Iowa academic standards adopted by the
 13  7 state board of education, to assessments of student progress,
 13  8 and to the collection of and access to student data.
 13  9    ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS.  The bill
 13 10 authorizes school districts to administer assessments to
 13 11 measure student academic progress which are in addition to the
 13 12 department of education=approved district=wide assessment of
 13 13 student progress administered for purposes of the core academic
 13 14 indicators in mathematics, reading, and science.
 13 15    ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CURRICULUM.  The bill continues
 13 16 to direct the state board to adopt sets of academic and
 13 17 assessment standards, but amends the terms used to describe
 13 18 the standards.  The bill replaces the terms "core curriculum",
 13 19 "Iowa core curriculum", and "Iowa common core", which were used
 13 20 to describe the academic standards adopted by the state board,
 13 21 with the term "Iowa academic standards".
 13 22    Also, provisions directing school districts to cooperate
 13 23 with each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to
 13 24 meet core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 25 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 26 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".
 13 27    The term "core content standards", which was used to
 13 28 describe the assessment standards adopted by the state
 13 29 board, is replaced with the term "assessment standards".  The
 13 30 assessment standards will remain applicable to all students
 13 31 in kindergarten through grade 12 in every school district and
 13 32 accredited nonpublic school. Corresponding changes are made
 13 33 throughout the Code, and obsolete language is eliminated.
 13 34    The bill states legislative intent that the selection and
 13 35 implementation of curriculum, textbooks, educational materials,
 14  1 and instructional methods must remain with the school districts
 14  2 and schools, and not with the state or federal government.
 14  3    Under the bill, the director of the department of education
 14  4 must maintain an internet site where persons may access
 14  5 up=to=date information regarding the Iowa academic standards
 14  6 and the assessment standards.  Periodically, beginning January
 14  7 1, 2016, the state board must review, accept public comments
 14  8 regarding, and revise as necessary, the Iowa academic standards
 14  9 and the assessment standards.
 14 10    The director is currently required to develop and distribute
 14 11 technical assistance and implementation strategies for the
 14 12 academic standards that school districts and accredited
 14 13 nonpublic schools shall use. The bill makes such use by school
 14 14 districts and schools voluntary.
 14 15    The director is further directed to submit an annual report
 14 16 to the general assembly by January 15 regarding the activities,
 14 17 findings, and student progress under the Iowa academic
 14 18 standards and the assessment standards. The annual report
 14 19 shall include the department's findings and recommendations.

 13  6    This bill relates to Iowa academic standards adopted by the
 13  7 state board of education, to assessments of student progress,
 13  8 and to the collection of and access to student data.
 13  9    ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS.  The bill
 13 10 authorizes school districts to administer assessments to
 13 11 measure student academic progress which are in addition to the

 13 15    ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CURRICULUM.  The bill continues
 13 16 to direct the state board to adopt sets of academic and
 13 17 assessment standards, but amends the terms used to describe
 13 18 the standards.  The bill replaces the terms "core curriculum",
 13 19 "Iowa core curriculum", and "Iowa common core", which were used
 13 20 to describe the academic standards adopted by the state board,
 13 21 with the term "Iowa academic standards".
 13 22    Also, provisions directing school districts to cooperate
 13 23 with each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to
 13 24 meet core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 25 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 26 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".
 13 27    The term "core content standards", which was used to
 13 28 describe the assessment standards adopted by the state
 13 29 board, is replaced with the term "assessment standards".  The
 13 30 assessment standards will remain applicable to all students
 13 31 in kindergarten through grade 12 in every school district and

 14 11 technical assistance and implementation strategies for the
 14 12 academic standards that school districts and accredited
 14 13 nonpublic schools shall use. The bill makes such use by school
 14 14 districts and schools voluntary.
 14 15    The director is further directed to submit an annual report
 14 16 to the general assembly by January 15 regarding the activities,
 14 17 findings, and student progress under the Iowa academic

 13  3                           EXPLANATION
 13  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  6    This bill relates to Iowa academic standards adopted by the
 13  7 state board of education, to assessments of student progress,
 13  8 and to the collection of and access to student data.
 13  9    ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS.  The bill
 13 10 authorizes school districts to administer assessments to
 13 11 measure student academic progress which are in addition to the
 13 12 department of education=approved district=wide assessment of
 13 13 student progress administered for purposes of the core academic
 13 14 indicators in mathematics, reading, and science.
 13 15    ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CURRICULUM.  The bill continues
 13 16 to direct the state board to adopt sets of academic and
 13 17 assessment standards, but amends the terms used to describe
 13 18 the standards.  The bill replaces the terms "core curriculum",
 13 19 "Iowa core curriculum", and "Iowa common core", which were used
 13 20 to describe the academic standards adopted by the state board,
 13 21 with the term "Iowa academic standards".
 13 22    Also, provisions directing school districts to cooperate
 13 23 with each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to
 13 24 meet core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 25 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 26 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".
 13 27    The term "core content standards", which was used to
 13 28 describe the assessment standards adopted by the state
 13 29 board, is replaced with the term "assessment standards".  The
 13 30 assessment standards will remain applicable to all students
 13 31 in kindergarten through grade 12 in every school district and
 13 32 accredited nonpublic school. Corresponding changes are made
 13 33 throughout the Code, and obsolete language is eliminated.
 13 34    The bill states legislative intent that the selection and
 13 35 implementation of curriculum, textbooks, educational materials,
 14  1 and instructional methods must remain with the school districts
 14  2 and schools, and not with the state or federal government.
 14  3    Under the bill, the director of the department of education
 14  4 must maintain an internet site where persons may access
 14  5 up=to=date information regarding the Iowa academic standards
 14  6 and the assessment standards.  Periodically, beginning January
 14  7 1, 2016, the state board must review, accept public comments
 14  8 regarding, and revise as necessary, the Iowa academic standards
 14  9 and the assessment standards.
 14 10    The director is currently required to develop and distribute
 14 11 technical assistance and implementation strategies for the
 14 12 academic standards that school districts and accredited
 14 13 nonpublic schools shall use. The bill makes such use by school
 14 14 districts and schools voluntary.
 14 15    The director is further directed to submit an annual report
 14 16 to the general assembly by January 15 regarding the activities,
 14 17 findings, and student progress under the Iowa academic
 14 18 standards and the assessment standards. The annual report
 14 19 shall include the department's findings and recommendations.
 14 20 The bill prohibits the director from implementing revisions
 14 21 or modifications to the Iowa academic standards after January
 14 22 1, 2015, and to the assessment standards adopted by the state
 14 23 board until the annual report is submitted to the general
 14 24 assembly or until after the director presents the proposed
 14 25 changes to the general assembly's standing committees on

 14 35 the department's findings and recommendations.  The department
 15  1 must also create a detailed student data security plan that
 15  2 includes privacy compliance standards, a data breach plan, data
 15  3 retention or destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing
 15  4 parental access to student data.

 15  6 department, school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools
 15  7 shall not include biometric, health, family or student voting

 15 35 having jurisdiction over education to report on the revision
 16  1 or modification to the existing student data collections
 16  2 maintained by the department, whichever occurs first.
 16  3    The new provisions relating to student data shall
 16  4 not be construed to supersede any existing open records
 16  5 law provisions, provisions relating to the department's
 16  6 comprehensive management information system which are in

 13 15    ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CURRICULUM.  The bill continues
 13 16 to direct the state board to adopt sets of academic and
 13 17 assessment standards, but amends the terms used to describe
 13 18 the standards.  The bill replaces the terms "core curriculum",
 13 19 "Iowa core curriculum", and "Iowa common core", which were used
 13 20 to describe the academic standards adopted by the state board,
 13 21 with the term "Iowa academic standards".
 13 22    Also, provisions directing school districts to cooperate
 13 23 with each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to
 13 24 meet core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 25 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 26 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".
 13 27    The term "core content standards", which was used to
 13 28 describe the assessment standards adopted by the state
 13 29 board, is replaced with the term "assessment standards".  The
 13 30 assessment standards will remain applicable to all students
 13 31 in kindergarten through grade 12 in every school district and
 13 32 accredited nonpublic school. Corresponding changes are made
 13 33 throughout the Code, and obsolete language is eliminated.
 13 34    The bill states legislative intent that the selection and
 13 35 implementation of curriculum, textbooks, educational materials,
 14  1 and instructional methods must remain with the school districts
 14  2 and schools, and not with the state or federal government.
 14  3    Under the bill, the director of the department of education
 14  4 must maintain an internet site where persons may access
 14  5 up=to=date information regarding the Iowa academic standards
 14  6 and the assessment standards.  Periodically, beginning January

 14  8 regarding, and revise as necessary, the Iowa academic standards
 14  9 and the assessment standards.
 14 10    The director is currently required to develop and distribute
 14 11 technical assistance and implementation strategies for the
 14 12 academic standards that school districts and accredited
 14 13 nonpublic schools shall use. The bill makes such use by school
 14 14 districts and schools voluntary.
 14 15    The director is further directed to submit an annual report
 14 16 to the general assembly by January 15 regarding the activities,
 14 17 findings, and student progress under the Iowa academic

 14 35 the department's findings and recommendations.  The department
 15  1 must also create a detailed student data security plan that
 15  2 includes privacy compliance standards, a data breach plan, data
 15  3 retention or destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing
 15  4 parental access to student data.
 15  5    Except as otherwise provided in state or federal law, the
 15  6 department, school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools
 15  7 shall not include biometric, health, family or student voting

 15 35 having jurisdiction over education to report on the revision

 13  3                           EXPLANATION
 13  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  6    This bill relates to Iowa academic standards adopted by the
 13  7 state board of education, to assessments of student progress,
 13  8 and to the collection of and access to student data.
 13  9    ASSESSMENTS OF STUDENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS.  The bill
 13 10 authorizes school districts to administer assessments to
 13 11 measure student academic progress which are in addition to the
 13 12 department of education=approved district=wide assessment of

 13 14 indicators in mathematics, reading, and science.
 13 15    ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND CURRICULUM.  The bill continues
 13 16 to direct the state board to adopt sets of academic and
 13 17 assessment standards, but amends the terms used to describe
 13 18 the standards.  The bill replaces the terms "core curriculum",
 13 19 "Iowa core curriculum", and "Iowa common core", which were used
 13 20 to describe the academic standards adopted by the state board,
 13 21 with the term "Iowa academic standards".
 13 22    Also, provisions directing school districts to cooperate
 13 23 with each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to
 13 24 meet core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 25 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 26 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".
 13 27    The term "core content standards", which was used to
 13 28 describe the assessment standards adopted by the state
 13 29 board, is replaced with the term "assessment standards".  The
 13 30 assessment standards will remain applicable to all students
 13 31 in kindergarten through grade 12 in every school district and
 13 32 accredited nonpublic school. Corresponding changes are made
 13 33 throughout the Code, and obsolete language is eliminated.
 13 34    The bill states legislative intent that the selection and
 13 35 implementation of curriculum, textbooks, educational materials,
 14  1 and instructional methods must remain with the school districts
 14  2 and schools, and not with the state or federal government.
 14  3    Under the bill, the director of the department of education
 14  4 must maintain an internet site where persons may access
 14  5 up=to=date information regarding the Iowa academic standards

 14  8 regarding, and revise as necessary, the Iowa academic standards
 14  9 and the assessment standards.
 14 10    The director is currently required to develop and distribute
 14 11 technical assistance and implementation strategies for the
 14 12 academic standards that school districts and accredited
 14 13 nonpublic schools shall use. The bill makes such use by school
 14 14 districts and schools voluntary.
 14 15    The director is further directed to submit an annual report
 14 16 to the general assembly by January 15 regarding the activities,

 14 35 the department's findings and recommendations.  The department
 15  1 must also create a detailed student data security plan that
 15  2 includes privacy compliance standards, a data breach plan, data
 15  3 retention or destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing
 15  4 parental access to student data.
 15  5    Except as otherwise provided in state or federal law, the
 15  6 department, school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools
 15  7 shall not include biometric, health, family or student voting
 15  8 status, family or student political affiliations, family or
 15  9 student religious affiliations, telephone information other
 15 10 than contact phone numbers, and criminal or juvenile justice

 15 17 responsibilities of the state board or the department.  Except
 15 18 as provided, student data shall not be provided outside of the
 15 19 state unless necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
 15 20 placement of a student who is transferring to another school.
 15 21    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
