  3 12 directly associated with providing employment transportation
  3 13 and cannot be used for capital expenditures or construction.

  3 27 for each grant awarded by the initiative.
  3 28    The bill requires the department to adopt administrative
  3 29 rules to administer the initiative, including but not limited
  3 30 to an application process and grant award criteria.
  3 31    The bill creates an employment rides fund in the state
  3 32 treasury under the control of the authority. The fund shall
