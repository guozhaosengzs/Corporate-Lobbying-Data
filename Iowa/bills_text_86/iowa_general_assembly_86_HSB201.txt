EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

not
constitute
agreement

the
explanation’s
substance
by

members
of

general
assembly.

firearms
and

20


FIREARM
SUPPRESSORS.
Current
Iowa
law
provides
that
a
21


mechanical
device
specifically
constructed
and
designed
so
that
22


when
attached
to
a
firearm
it
silences,
muffles,
or
suppresses
23


the
sound
when
fired
is
an
offensive
weapon.
Under
Code
24


section
724.3,
any
person
who
knowingly
possesses
an
offensive
25


weapon
commits
a
class
“D”
felony,
punishable
by
confinement
26


for
no
more
than
five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$750
but
not
27


more
than
$7,500.
28


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
in
Code
section
724.1(1)(h)
29


that
classifies
a
firearm
suppressor
as
an
offensive
weapon.
30


By
striking
this
provision,
a
firearm
suppressor
is
legal
31


to
possess
in
the
state.
This
provision
takes
effect
upon
32


enactment.
33


The
bill
also
creates
in

a

The
bill
defines
“firearm

specifically
constructed

designed
4


so
that
when
attached

suppressor
with

13


enforcement
officer

such
an

unless
the

15


is
prohibited

16


suppressor
or
the
applicant
is
the

proceeding
that
17


could
result
in
the
applicant
being
prohibited
by
law
from
18


making
or
transferring
a
firearm
suppressor.
If
the
chief
19


law
enforcement
officer
does
not
issue
a
certification
under
20


the
bill,
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
shall
provide
the
21


applicant
a
written
notification
of
the
denial
and
the
reason
22


for
the
denial.
If
the
certification
has
been
approved
by
the
23


chief
law
enforcement
officer
under
the
bill,
the
applicant
24


has
the
authority
to
make
or
transfer
a
firearm
suppressor
as
25


provided
by
state
and
federal
law.
26


If
the
applicant’s
request

certification
is

the
bill
specifies
that
the

28


to
the
district
court
for
the
county
in
which
the
applicant
29


resides

maintains

The
bill
specifies
30


that
the
court
shall
review
the
decision
of
the
chief
law
31


enforcement
officer
to
deny
the
certification
de

If
the
32


court
finds
that
the
applicant
is
not
prohibited
by
law
from

making

certification
under

bill,
a
chief
law
enforcement
officer
8


may

the
