  2 18                           EXPLANATION
  2 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 21    BILL.  This bill allows a person to apply manure originating
  2 22 from an animal feeding operation on saturated ground, unless
  2 23 it is liquid manure originating from a confinement feeding
  2 24 operation.  In that case, the bill prohibits the application of
  2 25 such liquid manure on saturated ground as well as on frozen or
  2 26 snow=covered ground regardless of the season.  The prohibition
  2 27 also requires a 24=hour delay if the national weather service
  2 28 forecasts rain.  The bill also prohibits a person from applying
  2 29 liquid manure originating from a confinement feeding operation
  2 30 on land having a slope with a grade exceeding 20 percent. The
  2 31 prohibitions do not apply: (1) if the manure originates from a
  2 32 small animal feeding operation or (2) the manure is injected or
  2 33 incorporated.
  2 34    CURRENT LAW.  Generally, a person may apply manure
  2 35 originating from an animal feeding operation on snow=covered
  3  1 or frozen ground, except during a period beginning in winter
  3  2 and ending in early spring. However, an exception allows such
  3  3 application if there is an emergency, the manure originates
  3  4 from a small animal feeding operation, or if the manure is
  3  5 injected or incorporated.  The prohibition is enforced by the
  3  6 department of natural resources.
  3  7    TERMS.  An "animal feeding operation" is a place where
  3  8 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys,
  3  9 or fish) are confined for 45 or more days in a 12=month
  3 10 period.  A "confinement feeding operation" is an animal feeding
  3 11 operation in which animals are confined in roofed areas (e.g.,
  3 12 buildings). A small animal feeding operation uses a formed
  3 13 manure storage that has less than a 500 animal unit capacity

  2 21    BILL.  This bill allows a person to apply manure originating
  2 22 from an animal feeding operation on saturated ground, unless
  2 23 it is liquid manure originating from a confinement feeding
  2 24 operation.  In that case, the bill prohibits the application of
  2 25 such liquid manure on saturated ground as well as on frozen or
  2 26 snow=covered ground regardless of the season.  The prohibition
  2 27 also requires a 24=hour delay if the national weather service
  2 28 forecasts rain.  The bill also prohibits a person from applying
  2 29 liquid manure originating from a confinement feeding operation
  2 30 on land having a slope with a grade exceeding 20 percent. The

  2 32 small animal feeding operation or (2) the manure is injected or

  2 35 originating from an animal feeding operation on snow=covered

  3  4 from a small animal feeding operation, or if the manure is
  3  5 injected or incorporated.  The prohibition is enforced by the
  3  6 department of natural resources.
  3  7    TERMS.  An "animal feeding operation" is a place where
  3  8 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys,
  3  9 or fish) are confined for 45 or more days in a 12=month
  3 10 period.  A "confinement feeding operation" is an animal feeding
  3 11 operation in which animals are confined in roofed areas (e.g.,
  3 12 buildings). A small animal feeding operation uses a formed

  3 10 period.  A "confinement feeding operation" is an animal feeding
  3 11 operation in which animals are confined in roofed areas (e.g.,
  3 12 buildings). A small animal feeding operation uses a formed
  3 13 manure storage that has less than a 500 animal unit capacity
  3 14 (e.g., 1,250 head of hogs weighing more than 55 pounds).
  3 15 Injection is the process of applying manure beneath the soil
  3 16 surface and incorporation is a process that mixes manure into
  3 17 the soil.
  3 18    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  A person who applies liquid manure

  3 10 period.  A "confinement feeding operation" is an animal feeding
  3 11 operation in which animals are confined in roofed areas (e.g.,

  3 14 (e.g., 1,250 head of hogs weighing more than 55 pounds).
