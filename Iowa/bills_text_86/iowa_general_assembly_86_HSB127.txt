may

case
upon

years
or
older
and
15

a

awarded

a
motor
19


vehicle
safety
belt
or

22


for
persons
under
the
age
of
18,
as
required
by
Code
section
23


321.446(6),
does
not
constitute
negligence
nor
is
such
evidence
24


admissible
in
a
civil
action.
A
child
restraint
system
is
a
25


specially

321.180B(1)
or
a
special
minors’
license
under
