 11  7                          APPLICABILITY
 11  8    Sec. 20.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to elections held
 11  9 on or after January 1, 2017.
 11 10                           EXPLANATION
 11 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 13    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 11 14 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 15 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements for
 11 16 election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered
 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 27 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 10 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 11 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 12 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 13 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 14 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 15 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 25 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 26 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 34 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 13 35 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  1 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  2 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 10 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 14 15 Only".
 14 16    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 17 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 18 registration by mail.
 14 19    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to
 14 20 elections held on or after January 1, 2017.

 11 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 13    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 11 14 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 15 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements for
 11 16 election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered
 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 27 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification

 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both

 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is

 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional

 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code

 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements

 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption

 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a

 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of

 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing

 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that

 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa

 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 25 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 26 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 34 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 13 35 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  1 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be

 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 10 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes

 11 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 13    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 11 14 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 15 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements for
 11 16 election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered
 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 27 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 10 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 11 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 12 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 13 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 14 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 15 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 25 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 26 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 34 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 13 35 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  1 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  2 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 10 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 14 15 Only".
 14 16    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 17 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 18 registration by mail.
 14 19    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 11 10                           EXPLANATION
 11 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 13    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 11 14 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 15 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements for
 11 16 election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered
 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 27 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 10 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 11 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 12 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 13 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 14 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 15 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 25 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 26 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 34 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 13 35 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  1 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  2 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 10 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 14 15 Only".
 14 16    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 17 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 18 registration by mail.
 14 19    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered

 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on

 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections

 11 10                           EXPLANATION
 11 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 13    This bill requires that a person provide certain proof of
 11 14 identification at the time that the person votes and modifies
 11 15 proof of identification and proof of residence requirements for
 11 16 election day and in=person absentee registration.
 11 17    Division I of the bill modifies the proof of identification
 11 18 and proof of residence requirements for election day and
 11 19 in=person absentee registration. The bill requires that
 11 20 acceptable proof of identification is the same proof of
 11 21 identification required of a voter who is already registered
 11 22 to vote. The bill removes residential leases and property tax
 11 23 statements from the list of acceptable documents to provide
 11 24 proof of residence for election day and in=person absentee
 11 25 registration.
 11 26    The bill maintains current law allowing a person wishing
 11 27 to register to vote on election day, or in person when voting
 11 28 an absentee ballot, to establish proof of identity and proof
 11 29 of residence by written oath of a person who is registered to
 11 30 vote in the precinct, but requires that the oath of the person
 11 31 wishing to vote and the registered voter's oath be executed on
 11 32 the same piece of paper.
 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being
 11 35 allowed to vote, and also requires that a person wishing to
 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 10 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 11 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who
 12 12 provides their own proof of identification and who attests
 12 13 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 14 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 15 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 12 25 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill provides that an
 12 26 attesting person is prohibited from signing any additional such
 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
 13 20 $750 but not more than $7,500. The bill also provides that
 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will
 13 31 be required to show proof of identification before casting a
 13 32 ballot.
 13 33    The bill requires that certain persons residing in a
 13 34 hospital or health care facility who apply to vote by absentee
 13 35 ballot shall present proof of identification. If the applicant
 14  1 is unable to present proof of identification they shall be
 14  2 allowed to execute an affidavit in the form prescribed by the
 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a
 14 10 nonoperator's identification card for the purpose of voting
 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
 14 15 Only".
 14 16    Division II of the bill makes conforming changes to certain
 14 17 required notices on forms related to voter registration and
 14 18 registration by mail.
 14 19    Division III of the bill provides that the bill applies to

 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code

 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a

 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the

 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 13 19 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least

 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit

 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and

 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a

 11 33    The bill requires that a voter provide proof of
 11 34 identification to a precinct election official before being

 12  1 vote by absentee ballot at a county commissioner of elections
 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification

 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least

 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a

 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code

 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a

 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent

 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by

 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a

 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent

 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots

 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be

 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a

 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be

 12 27 oaths for the same election.
 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is
 12 29 established the person shall then be allowed to vote. If a
 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit

 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be

 14  3 state commissioner of elections, stating that the voter does
 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.
 14  6 If the applicant refuses to execute such an affidavit and is
 14  7 unable to present proof of identification, the voter is allowed
 14  8 to cast a provisional ballot.
 14  9    The bill also provides that a person obtaining a

 12  2 office or at a satellite absentee voting station present
 12  3 the same proof of identification. The bill requires that
 12  4 acceptable proof of identification show the name of the
 12  5 individual voter, include a photograph of the voter, and be
 12  6 issued by the government of the United States, the state of
 12  7 Iowa, an Iowa public or private university or college, an Iowa
 12  8 secondary school, or a political subdivision of the state.
 12  9    The bill provides that, in lieu of providing identification
 12 10 in order to vote, a person may establish proof of identity by
 12 11 written oath of the person wishing to vote and of a person who

 12 13 to the voter's identity. The bill provides that the oath
 12 14 shall be in the form prescribed by the state commissioner of
 12 15 elections, and that the oath shall state the identity of the
 12 16 person wishing to vote and shall attest to the stated identity
 12 17 of the person wishing to vote. The bill requires that the oath
 12 18 be signed by both the attesting person and the person wishing
 12 19 to vote. The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsely sign
 12 20 an oath pursuant to this provision or to falsely attest to a
 12 21 voter's identity. The bill requires that the oath advise both
 12 22 persons that falsely stating or attesting to a voter's identity
 12 23 is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable by
 12 24 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least

 12 28    The bill provides that if proof of identification is

 12 30 person is unable or refuses to present proof of identification,
 12 31 or if the precinct election official determines that the
 12 32 proof of identification does not meet specified requirements,
 12 33 the person shall be offered the option to vote a provisional
 12 34 ballot. If a person is casting a provisional ballot
 12 35 under these circumstances, the person shall receive a
 13  1 printed statement giving notice of the types of acceptable
 13  2 identification and notice that the person is required to show
 13  3 acceptable identification before the provisional ballot can be
 13  4 counted unless the voter executes an affidavit pursuant to Code
 13  5 section 49.81, subsection 5. If a voter casts a provisional
 13  6 ballot for these reasons, the precinct election official shall
 13  7 indicate on the provisional ballot that the voter is casting
 13  8 a provisional ballot due to the voter's inability or refusal
 13  9 to present proof of identification. The bill provides that a
 13 10 voter casting a provisional ballot for this reason may execute
 13 11 an affidavit in the form prescribed by the state commissioner
 13 12 of elections, affirming that the voter is the person the voter
 13 13 claims to be and affirming that the voter is either indigent
 13 14 and unable to obtain proof of identification without the
 13 15 payment of a fee or that the voter has a religious objection to
 13 16 being photographed.
 13 17    The bill makes it a class "D" felony to falsify an affidavit
 13 18 that attests to identity. A class "D" felony is punishable by

 13 21 any provisional ballot cast accompanied by such an affidavit
 13 22 shall be presumed valid unless additional written statements
 13 23 or documents are delivered to the county commissioner of
 13 24 elections office prior to the date that provisional ballots
 13 25 are considered and the precinct election board determines that
 13 26 such additional evidence successfully rebuts the presumption
 13 27 of validity.
 13 28    The bill also makes changes to the election notice to be
 13 29 published by the county commissioner of elections to require
 13 30 that election notices include a statement that all voters will

 14  4 not have and is unable to obtain proof of identification and
 14  5 that the voter resides in a hospital or health care facility.

 14 11 shall not be charged for the issuance of the nonoperator's
 14 12 identification card. The bill requires that nonoperator's
 14 13 identification cards issued to serve as proof of identification
 14 14 for voting be labeled by the department as "For Voting Purposes
