and
including

OF

LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS
——
GOALS
AND
INTENT.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
2


a.
In
the
majority
of
states,
Medicaid
managed
care
has
3


been
introduced
on
an
incremental
basis,
beginning
with
the
4


enrollment
of
low-income
children
and
parents
and
proceeding
5


in
stages
to
include
nonelderly
persons
with
disabilities
6


and
older
individuals.
Iowa,
unlike
the
majority
of
states,
7


is
implementing
Medicaid
managed
care
simultaneously
across
8


a
broad
and
diverse
population
that
includes
individuals
9


with
complex
health
care
and
long-term
services
and
supports
10


needs,
making
these
individuals
especially
vulnerable
to
11


receiving
inappropriate,
inadequate,
or
substandard
services
12


and
supports.
13


b.
The
success
or
failure
of
Medicaid
managed
care
in
Iowa
14


depends
on
proper
strategic
planning
and
strong
oversight,
and
15


the
incorporation
of
the
core
values,
principles,
and
goals
16


of
the
strategic
plan
into
Medicaid
managed
care
contractual
17


obligations.
While
Medicaid
managed
care
techniques
may
create
18


pathways
and
offer
opportunities
toward
quality
improvement
and
19


predictability
in
costs,
if
cost
savings
and
administrative
20


efficiencies
are
the
primary
goals,
Medicaid
managed
care
may
21


instead
erect
new
barriers
and
limit
the
care
and
support
22


options
available,
especially
to
high-need,
vulnerable
Medicaid
23


recipients.
A
well-designed
strategic
plan
and
effective
24


oversight
ensure
that
cost
savings,
improved
health
outcomes,
25


and
efficiencies
are
not
achieved
at
the
expense
of
diminished
26


program
integrity,
a
reduction
in
the
quality
or
availability
27


of
services,
or
adverse
consequences
to
the
health
and
28


well-being
of
Medicaid
recipients.
29


c.
Strategic
planning
should
include
all
of
the
following:
30


(1)
Guidance
in
establishing
and
maintaining
a
robust
31


and
appropriate
workforce
and
a
provider
network
capable
of
32


addressing
all
of
the
diverse,
distinct,
and
wide-ranging
33


treatment
and
support
needs
of
Medicaid
recipients.
34


(2)
Developing
a
sound
methodology
for
establishing
and

adjusting

to
account
for
all
essential
costs
1


involved
in
treating
and
supporting
the
entire
spectrum
of
2


needs
across
recipient
populations.
3


(3)
Addressing
the
sufficiency
of
information
and
data
4


resources
to
enable
review
of
factors
such
as
utilization,
5


service
trends,
system
performance,
and
outcomes.
6


(4)
Building
effective
working
relationships
and
developing
7


strategies
to
support
community-level
integration
that
provides
8


cross-system
coordination
and
synchronization
among
the
various
9


service
sectors,
providers,
agencies,
and
organizations
to
10


further
holistic
well-being
and
population
health
goals.
11


d.
While
the
contracts
entered
into
between
the
state
12


and
managed
care
organizations
function
as
a
mechanism
for
13


enforcing
requirements
established
by
the
federal
and
state
14


governments
and
allow
states
to
shift
the
financial
risk
15


associated
with
caring
for
Medicaid
recipients
to
these
16


contractors,
the
state
ultimately
retains
responsibility
for
17


the
Medicaid
program
and
the
oversight
of
the
performance
of
18


the
program’s
contractors.
Administration
of
the
Medicaid
19


program
benefits
by
managed
care
organizations
should
not
be
20


viewed
by
state
policymakers
and
state
agencies
as
a
means
of
21


divesting
themselves
of
their
constitutional
and
statutory
22


responsibilities
to
ensure
that
recipients
of
publicly
funded
23


services
and
supports,
as
well
as
taxpayers
in
general,
are
24


effectively
served.
25


e.
Overseeing
the
performance
of
Medicaid
managed
care
26


contractors
requires
a
different
set
of
skills
than
those
27


required
for
administering
a
fee-for-service
program.
In
the
28


absence
of
the
in-house
capacity
of
the
department
of
human
29


services
to
perform
tasks
specific
to
Medicaid
managed
care
30


oversight,
the
state
essentially
cedes
its
responsibilities
31


to
private
contractors
and
relinquishes
its
accountability
32


to
the
public.
In
order
to
meet
these
responsibilities,
33


state
policymakers
must
ensure
that
the
state,
including
the
34


department
of
human
services
as
the
state
Medicaid
agency,
has
35

S.F.
_____


the
authority
and
resources,
including
the
adequate
number
of
1


qualified
personnel
and
the
necessary
tools,
to
carry
out
these
2


responsibilities,
provide
effective
administration,
and
ensure
3


accountability
and
compliance.
4


f.
State
policymakers
must
also
ensure
that
Medicaid
5


managed
care
contracts
contain,
at
a
minimum,
clear,
6


unambiguous
performance
standards,
operating
guidelines,
7


data
collection,
maintenance,
retention,
and
reporting
8


requirements,
and
outcomes
expectations
so
that
contractors
9


and
subcontractors
are
held
accountable
to
clear
contract
10


specifications.
11


g.
As
with
all
system
and
program
redesign
efforts
12


undertaken
in
the
state
to
date,
the
assumption
of
the
13


administration
of
Medicaid
program
benefits
by
managed
care
14


organizations
must
involve
ongoing
stakeholder
input
and
15


earn
the
trust
and
support
of
these
stakeholders.
Medicaid
16


recipients,
providers,
advocates,
and
other
stakeholders
have
17


intimate
knowledge
of
the
people
and
processes
involved
in
18


ensuring
the
health
and
safety
of
Medicaid
recipients,
and
are
19


able
to
offer
valuable
insight
into
the
barriers
likely
to
be
20


encountered
as
well
as
propose
solutions
for
overcoming
these
21


obstacles.
Local
communities
and
providers
of
services
and
22


supports
have
firsthand
experience
working
with
the
Medicaid
23


recipients
they
serve
and
are
able
to
identify
factors
that
24


must
be
considered
to
make
a
system
successful.
Agencies
and
25


organizations
that
have
specific
expertise
and
experience
with
26


the
services
and
supports
needs
of
Medicaid
recipients
and
27


their
families
are
uniquely
placed
to
provide
needed
assistance
28


in
developing
the
measures
for
and
in
evaluating
the
quality
29


of
the
program.
30


2.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
the
31


Medicaid
program
be
implemented
and
administered,
including
32


through
Medicaid
managed
care
policies
and
contract
provisions,
33


in
a
manner
that
safeguards
the
interests
of
Medicaid
34


recipients,
encourages
the
participation
of
Medicaid
providers,
