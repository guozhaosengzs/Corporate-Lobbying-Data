Under
current
law,
anyone
may
submit
a
request
to
the
2


department
of
transportation
for
approval
of
a
new
special
3


registration
plate
with
a
processed
emblem.
If
the
department

approves
the
request
and
the
design
of
the
proposed

5


a
minimum
of
500
paid
applications
are
required
before
the
6


department
begins
issuing
the
plate.
The
department
may
cancel
7


its
approval
if

are
not
received

fee
for

fees
are
deposited
in
the

alternative
process
allows
for
a

fees
of
$35
for
13


issuance
and

for
renewal.
Those
fees
are
credited
to

sponsoring
state
agency.
15


The
bill

an
organization
decal
to
be
20


designed,
produced,
and
issued
by
a
qualifying
organization,
21


rather
than
the
department.
The
plates
will
be
available
22


without
an
additional
special
plate
fee
at
the
time
of
initial
23


registration
of
a
vehicle,
and
will
be
renewed
annually
upon
24


payment
of
the
regular
annual
registration
fee
for
the
vehicle.
25


A
$5
replacement
fee
applies
if
the
plates
are
issued
in
26


exchange
for
regular
or
special
plates.
The
new

also
be

fees.

members,
whose

others,

is
not
discriminatory.
A
group
of
such
organizations
with
a
33


common
purpose
may
also
be
approved
to
issue
a
decal.
The
