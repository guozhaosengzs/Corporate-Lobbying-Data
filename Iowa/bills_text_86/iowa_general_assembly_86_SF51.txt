  2  6      2  6      2  7 enforcement officer may provide for the emergency rescue of

  2 14    c.  Takes only such action as is necessary to perform the

  2 17    d.  Provides notice of the rescue to the animal's responsible
  2 18 party or any other person owning or operating the motor vehicle
  2 19 confining the animal.  The notice shall state where the rescued
  2 20 animal may be retrieved.  The notice may be made personally or
  2 21 in writing and placed in that part of the motor vehicle where
  2 22 the animal was confined.
  2 23                           EXPLANATION
  2 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 26    ANIMAL NEGLECT.  This bill provides that a person commits
  2 27 animal neglect by confining an animal in a stationary motor
  2 28 vehicle.  The confinement must be uninterrupted for a period
  2 29 in which, under the circumstances, including temperature and
  2 30 humidity levels, the animal faces imminent injury or death.
  2 31 There are two exceptions: (1) the motor vehicle is occupied
  2 32 by a person who may obtain any form of driver's license or
  2 33 (2) the motor vehicle is unoccupied by such a person due to
  2 34 an emergency.  A person who commits animal neglect under the
  2 35 bill is guilty of a simple misdemeanor which is punishable by
  3  1 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least
  3  2 $65 but not more than $625, or by both. However, a person
  3  3 who intentionally commits the offense of animal neglect
  3  4 that results in serious injury to or the death of an animal
  3  5 is guilty of a serious misdemeanor which is punishable by
  3  6 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  3  7 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  3  8    RESCUE.  The bill provides that a law enforcement officer may
  3  9 rescue an animal confined in a motor vehicle.  Four conditions
  3 10 must be satisfied.  The officer must:  (1) make a determination
  3 11 that the animal requires immediate attention, (2) have probable
  3 12 cause to make an arrest for animal neglect, (3) take only such
  3 13 action as is necessary to perform the rescue, and (4) provide
  3 14 notice of the rescue to either a person who owns or maintains
  3 15 the animal or owns or operates the motor vehicle.
  3 16    CURRENT LAW.  Code chapter 717B provides for the welfare
  3 17 of animals other than livestock, game not owned by a person,
  3 18 or animals declared a nuisance by the department of natural
  3 19 resources (Code section 717B.1).  A person commits animal
  3 20 neglect by failing to provide an animal with adequate food
  3 21 or water, or a confined dog or cat with adequate shelter,
  3 22 or torturing, depriving of sustenance, mutilating, beating,
  3 23 or killing an animal by any means that causes unjustified
  3 24 pain, distress, or suffering (Code section 717B.3). A law
  3 25 enforcement officer (a member of a city police force or county
  3 26 sheriff's office) may enter onto private property in order to
  3 27 rescue a neglected animal after consulting with a licensed
  3 28 veterinarian and complying with applicable federal and state
  3 29 constitutional requirements (Code section 717B.5).  A rescued
  3 30 animal is then transferred to the custody of a local authority
  3 31 (a city or county) which notifies the responsible party (the
  3 32 person owning or maintaining the animal).  A district court
  3 33 finally determines whether an animal is neglected and the
  3 34 animal's disposition (Code section 717B.4).

  3  8    RESCUE.  The bill provides that a law enforcement officer may
  3  9 rescue an animal confined in a motor vehicle.  Four conditions
  3 10 must be satisfied.  The officer must:  (1) make a determination
  3 11 that the animal requires immediate attention, (2) have probable
  3 12 cause to make an arrest for animal neglect, (3) take only such
  3 13 action as is necessary to perform the rescue, and (4) provide
  3 14 notice of the rescue to either a person who owns or maintains
  3 15 the animal or owns or operates the motor vehicle.
  3 16    CURRENT LAW.  Code chapter 717B provides for the welfare
  3 17 of animals other than livestock, game not owned by a person,
  3 18 or animals declared a nuisance by the department of natural
  3 19 resources (Code section 717B.1).  A person commits animal
  3 20 neglect by failing to provide an animal with adequate food
  3 21 or water, or a confined dog or cat with adequate shelter,
  3 22 or torturing, depriving of sustenance, mutilating, beating,
  3 23 or killing an animal by any means that causes unjustified
  3 24 pain, distress, or suffering (Code section 717B.3). A law
  3 25 enforcement officer (a member of a city police force or county
  3 26 sheriff's office) may enter onto private property in order to
  3 27 rescue a neglected animal after consulting with a licensed
  3 28 veterinarian and complying with applicable federal and state
  3 29 constitutional requirements (Code section 717B.5).  A rescued
  3 30 animal is then transferred to the custody of a local authority
  3 31 (a city or county) which notifies the responsible party (the
  3 32 person owning or maintaining the animal).  A district court

  2 26    ANIMAL NEGLECT.  This bill provides that a person commits
  2 27 animal neglect by confining an animal in a stationary motor
  2 28 vehicle.  The confinement must be uninterrupted for a period
  2 29 in which, under the circumstances, including temperature and
  2 30 humidity levels, the animal faces imminent injury or death.
  2 31 There are two exceptions: (1) the motor vehicle is occupied
  2 32 by a person who may obtain any form of driver's license or
  2 33 (2) the motor vehicle is unoccupied by such a person due to
  2 34 an emergency.  A person who commits animal neglect under the
  2 35 bill is guilty of a simple misdemeanor which is punishable by
  3  1 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least
  3  2 $65 but not more than $625, or by both. However, a person
  3  3 who intentionally commits the offense of animal neglect
  3  4 that results in serious injury to or the death of an animal
  3  5 is guilty of a serious misdemeanor which is punishable by
  3  6 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  3  7 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  3  8    RESCUE.  The bill provides that a law enforcement officer may
  3  9 rescue an animal confined in a motor vehicle.  Four conditions
  3 10 must be satisfied.  The officer must:  (1) make a determination
  3 11 that the animal requires immediate attention, (2) have probable
  3 12 cause to make an arrest for animal neglect, (3) take only such
  3 13 action as is necessary to perform the rescue, and (4) provide
  3 14 notice of the rescue to either a person who owns or maintains
  3 15 the animal or owns or operates the motor vehicle.
  3 16    CURRENT LAW.  Code chapter 717B provides for the welfare
  3 17 of animals other than livestock, game not owned by a person,
  3 18 or animals declared a nuisance by the department of natural
  3 19 resources (Code section 717B.1).  A person commits animal
  3 20 neglect by failing to provide an animal with adequate food
  3 21 or water, or a confined dog or cat with adequate shelter,
  3 22 or torturing, depriving of sustenance, mutilating, beating,
  3 23 or killing an animal by any means that causes unjustified
  3 24 pain, distress, or suffering (Code section 717B.3). A law
  3 25 enforcement officer (a member of a city police force or county
  3 26 sheriff's office) may enter onto private property in order to
  3 27 rescue a neglected animal after consulting with a licensed
  3 28 veterinarian and complying with applicable federal and state
  3 29 constitutional requirements (Code section 717B.5).  A rescued
  3 30 animal is then transferred to the custody of a local authority
  3 31 (a city or county) which notifies the responsible party (the
  3 32 person owning or maintaining the animal).  A district court
  3 33 finally determines whether an animal is neglected and the
  3 34 animal's disposition (Code section 717B.4).
