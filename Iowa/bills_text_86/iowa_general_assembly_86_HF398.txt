  3 10 nematodes, fungi, weeds, or other forms of plant or animal life
  3 11 or viruses; and includes any substance used as a plant growth

  2 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 19    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Pesticide Act of Iowa"
  2 20 (Code chapter 206) by providing for incidents involving
  2 21 "drift", which is defined to mean the movement of a pesticide
  2 22 either during or after its application (usually to land or
  2 23 crops) through the air to another site. The provisions are
  2 24 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture and
  2 25 land stewardship (DALS).
  2 26    REPORTING.  The bill amends a provision which allows a person
  2 27 to file a claim for damages from a pesticide application with
  2 28 DALS by allowing a person to complete and file the report form
  2 29 via the internet.
  2 30    APPROPRIATIONS ==== GENERAL FUND.  The bill appropriates
  2 31 moneys to DALS from the general fund of the state for purposes
  2 32 of assisting persons alleging damages caused by drift,
  2 33 including by improving or expanding DALS' internet site and
  2 34 by reducing the wait period for a person alleging damages to
  2 35 receive the results of a test conducted by DALS.  The bill also
  3  1 allows DALS to have such tests conducted by another laboratory,
  3  2 including a private laboratory. The appropriations revert at
  3  3 the close of FY 2016=2017.
  3  4    APPROPRIATIONS ==== CIVIL PENALTIES.  The bill also provides
  3  5 that civil damages collected by DALS from violations involving
  3  6 drift by commercial applicators are appropriated to DALS for
  3  7 purposes of conducting the tests.
  3  8    BACKGROUND.  A pesticide is any substance used to prevent,
  3  9 destroy, repel, or mitigate damages caused by insects, rodents,
  3 10 nematodes, fungi, weeds, or other forms of plant or animal life
  3 11 or viruses; and includes any substance used as a plant growth
  3 12 regulator, defoliant, or desiccant (Code section 206.2).  A
  3 13 person claiming damages from a pesticide application must file
  3 14 a report with DALS, which then may conduct an investigation of
  3 15 the matter (Code section 206.14). DALS may establish, assess,
  3 16 and collect civil penalties for violations by commercial
  3 17 applicators for an amount not to exceed $500 for each offense
  3 18 (Code section 206.19).

  3 10 nematodes, fungi, weeds, or other forms of plant or animal life
  3 11 or viruses; and includes any substance used as a plant growth
  3 12 regulator, defoliant, or desiccant (Code section 206.2).  A
  3 13 person claiming damages from a pesticide application must file
  3 14 a report with DALS, which then may conduct an investigation of
  3 15 the matter (Code section 206.14). DALS may establish, assess,
